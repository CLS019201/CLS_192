After the album's commercial success, the trio continued the studio project with their next release, ''Force of Nature'' in 1995.  This album garnered an even bigger success than their debut spawning the popular single ''Here Comes the Night'' featuring guest guitarist Peter White.  After a two year break, 3rd Force released their 3rd album ''Vital Force'' in 1997. The album gained 3rd Force's second hit single ''You Gotta Be Real'' once again featuring guest guitarist Peter White.  The 4th album, called ''Force Field'', was released in 1999 resulting in another of the band's singles ''Revelation of the Heart'', with guest saxophonist Paul Taylor.  In 2000 Higher Octave released a best-of compilation of 3rd Force, entitled ''Collective Force'', which featured the band's best hits in both radio and fan favorites,along with two new songs, ''Dance With Me'' and ''Sweet Surrender''.  2002 saw the release of their 5th studio album, ''Gentle Force'', which showcased a mellower jazz sound than the band's usual output. Three years later,3rd Force released their latest album to date, ''Driving Force'' in 2005.  Their latest release showcases a completely opposite style than the previous ''Gentle Force'' album which was almost lounge-style mellow jazz in sound. ''Driving Force'', however, features a funky lively jazz mix never before heard in 3rd Force's music.  The most popular singles from their latest release are ''Believe In Me'', featuring the trumpeter [[Greg Adams (musician)|Greg Adams]], keyboardist [[Jeff Lorber]], and guitarist [[Brian Hughes (musician)|Brian Hughes]], and ''You Got It'', featuring guitarist [[Marc Antoine (musician)|Marc Antoine]]."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"2733539":{"pageid":2733539,"ns":0,"title":"Philip Aaberg","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist\n|name           = Philip Aaberg\n| image         = \n| caption       = \n| image_size    = \n|background     = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n|birth_place    = {{Birth date and age|1949|04|08}}\n|origin         = [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], [[Montana]], [[United States|USA]]\n|instrument     = [[piano]]\n|genre          = [[Jazz]], [[instrumental]]\n|occupation     = [[Composer]], [[musician]]\n|years_active   = 1979\u2013present\n|associated_acts= [[William Ackerman|Will Ackerman]], [[Darol Anger]], [[Michael Hedges]]\n}}\n\n'''Philip Aaberg''' (born April 8, 1949) is an American pianist, keyboardist, and composer.<ref name=aaberg>{{cite news|title=Philip Aaberg Plays for Fine Arts Series Finale|newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/arts_and_entertainment/sounds/article_afaf9cc0-66d7-11e0-a00c-001cc4c002e0.html|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> He gained international recognition through a series of successful piano recordings released on [[Windham Hill Records]].

After a three-year period of experimentation he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with the flamboyant, [[androgynous]] [[alter ego]] Ziggy Stardust, spearheaded by the hit single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Bowie's impact at that time, as described by biographer David Buckley, \"challenged the core belief of the rock music of its day\" and \"created perhaps the biggest cult in popular culture.\"<ref name=\"buckley_legacy\" /> The relatively short-lived Ziggy persona proved merely one facet of a career marked by continual reinvention, musical innovation and striking visual presentation.\n\nIn 1975, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the number-one single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the hit album ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'', which the singer characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\". The sound constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. He then confounded the expectations of both his record label and his American audiences by recording the [[minimalist music|minimalist]] album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977)\u2014the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] over the next two years. ''Low'', ''[[\"Heroes\"]]'', and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'', the so-called \"Berlin Trilogy\" albums, all reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise. After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and \"[[Under Pressure]]\", a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He then reached a new commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'', which yielded several hit singles. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[blue-eyed soul]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]], and [[drum and bass|jungle]]. He has not toured since the 2003\u201304 [[Reality Tour]] and has not performed live since 2006. Bowie's latest studio album ''[[The Next Day]]'' was released in March 2013.\n\nDavid Buckley says of Bowie: \"His influence has been unique in popular culture\u2014he has permeated and altered more lives than any comparable figure.\"<ref name=\"buckley_legacy\" /> In the BBC's 2002 poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], Bowie was placed at number 29.

Since his release from prison in 2009, he has recorded three further black metal albums and another ambient/electronic album.\n\nAlthough Vikernes is known for his political views, he does not use Burzum to promote those views.

He then studied at [[Colchester Institute]] art school in Essex, England, taking inspiration from [[minimalism|minimalist]] painting. During his time on the art course at the Institute, he also gained experience in playing and making music through teaching sessions held in the adjacent music school. He joined the band [[Roxy Music]] as synthesiser player in the early 1970s. Roxy Music's success in the [[glam rock]] scene came quickly, but Eno soon became tired of touring and of conflicts with lead singer [[Bryan Ferry]].\n\nEno's solo music has explored more [[experimental music]]al styles and ambient music.

By the end of the 1970s, Eno had worked with [[Robert Fripp]] on the LPs ''[[No Pussyfooting]]'' and ''[[Evening Star (album)|Evening Star]]'', [[David Bowie]] on the seminal \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\" and helped popularise the American band [[Devo]] and the punk-influenced \"[[No Wave]]\" genre. He produced and performed on three albums by [[Talking Heads]], including ''[[Remain in Light]]'' (1980), and produced seven albums for [[U2]], including ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987). Eno has also worked on records by [[James (band)|James]], [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]], [[Coldplay]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Grace Jones]], [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]] and [[Slowdive]], among others.\n\nEno pursues multimedia ventures in parallel to his music career, including [[art installation]]s, a regular column on society and innovation in ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazine, and \"[[Oblique Strategies]]\" (written with [[Peter Schmidt (artist)|Peter Schmidt]]), a deck of cards in which cryptic remarks or random insights are intended to resolve dilemmas.

On graduating, and after a period of [[busking]] in London (where he briefly shared a house with artists [[Mark Wallinger]] and [[Andy Dog]]), he returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for the mentally handicapped.\n\nHis first recording experience was in 1983 with his brother [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] for the album ''Apollo'' at Lanois\u2019 Grant Avenue Studios in Canada. His first solo album, ''Voices'', was released in 1985.  \n\nAlthough mainly regarded as a pianist, Roger Eno is in fact a multi-instrumentalist and keen singer, as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]], [[No-Man]], [[Lol Hammond]], [[Mads Arp]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Tim Bowness]], and [[Michael Brook]], the most successful of which was probably his co-written album, ''The Familiar'', with [[Kate St John]].\n\nEno performs live on occasion and continues to write soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films, including ''[[For All Mankind]]'', ''[[Nine and a Half Weeks]]'', ''[[Warm Summer Rain]]'' and ''[[The Jacket]]'', while tracks have been used in advertisements, including for Nissan and for Japan Railways.\n\nEno has recently recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the UK-based internet label [[Burning Shed]].

In harmony with their name, their lyrics are heavily [[divine grace|grace]]-themed.\n\nAs well as going through several different band line-ups (with at least one different one per album), Falling Up has gone through several transformations in terms of musical style mainly due to a constantly changing line-up, in which certain members who played instruments on previous albums left the band. For example, the band's original turntablists, Andrew Wadlow and Michael Humphrey, left after their first two albums, which caused them to morph into a more [[electronic rock]] sound with the welcome of keyboardist Adam Taylor (who did not play turntables). With their debut, ''Crashings'', the band introduced a [[nu metal]]-influenced style with [[raprock]] elements they referred to as \"core-rock\".<ref>Falling Up - Christian Music Today</ref> Later on, Falling Up moved more in the direction of melodic rock, and experimented with [[electronic music|electronic and synthetic music]], which gradually morphed into an overall [[experimental rock]] sound.

From 1971 to 1987 he was a member of the electronic group [[Tangerine Dream]]. Initially a drummer with The Agitation, later renamed [[Agitation Free]], his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its [[psychedelic rock]] origins. While he was not the first musician to use an [[analog sequencer]], he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument, thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic [[Tangerine Dream]] pieces and indeed for the whole [[Berlin School of electronic music|Berlin school]] sound.\n\nAfter his departure from the group, he founded the [[Sonic Images]] record label, a [[New Age music]] label called [[Earthtone]] and the [[Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra]], and produced a number of solo music works. After leaving Tangerine Dream, his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London. He performed on stage with [http://DingDingMusic.com Edgar Rothermich] (aka Richard E. Roth) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990.\n\nFranke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work. In 1995 he scored the [[AFI Conservatory|AFI]] short, ''[[Requiem (1995 film)|Requiem]]''. He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', as well as the score of the [[anime]] movie ''[[Tenchi Muyo! in Love]]'' and in 2005 the music for German musical ''[[Ludwig\u00b2]]'' (with [[Konstantin Wecker]])."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"4071203":{"pageid":4071203,"ns":0,"title":"Freescha","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Freescha\n| image                 = <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[image:Freescha2.jpg|300px|Freescha]] -->\n| caption            = <!-- From Freescha's MySpace Website -->\n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = [[San Fernando Valley]], California, USA\n| genre               = [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]]\n| years_active        = 1999 &ndash; \n| label               = [[AttackNine Records|AttackNine]]\n| website                 = http://www.attacknine.com/\n| current_members     = currently regrowing members\n}}'''Freescha''' is the musical collaboration of '''Nick Huntington''' and '''Michael McGroarty''', based in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]].

From an early age he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including those of street performers, [[jazz]] musicians, and the artist [[Pierre Soulages]]. He played guitar in a band, but his musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], a pioneer of [[musique concr\u00e8te]] at the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]].\n\nHis first mainstream success was the 1976 album ''[[Oxyg\u00e8ne]]''. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12&nbsp;million copies. ''Oxyg\u00e8ne'' was followed in 1978 by ''[[Equinoxe|\u00c9quinoxe]]'', and in 1979 Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the [[Place de la Concorde]], a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as well as a musician.\n\nAs of 2004 Jarre had sold an estimated 80&nbsp;million albums. He was the first Western musician officially invited to perform in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and holds the world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"36678493":{"pageid":36678493,"ns":0,"title":"Job Karma","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=February 2013}}\n{{BLP sources|date=August 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n |name                  = Job Karma\n |background            = group_or_band\n |years_active          = 1997-present \n |origin                = [[Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Poland]]\n |genre                 = [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[Ambient music|ambient]]\n |current_members       = Maciej Frett <br /> Aureliusz Pisarzewski <br /> Arkadiusz Bagi\u0144ski\n |past_members          = Jacek Groszek\n |www                   = http://www.jobkarma.pl}}\n\n'''Job Karma''' is a post-[[Industrial music|industrial]]-[[Ambient music|ambient]] band from [[Wroc\u0142aw]].

Born Edward Larry Gordon in [[Philadelphia]], he studied violin, piano, trombone and voice in his early years in New Jersey.  He attended [[Howard University]], a [[historically black university]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on a scholarship to study composition and [[piano]].  After studying at [[Howard University|Howard]], he spent time in [[New York City|New York]] pursuing a career as a stand-up [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. \n\nIn the early seventies he began to study Eastern [[mysticism]] and believed he'd found a new path for his music and his life.  It was also at this time he bought his first [[zither]] from a local [[pawn shop]].  Converting it to an [[electronic instrument]], he began to experiment using the instrument like a piano.  By 1978, he developed enough skill to begin [[busking]] in the parks and on the sidewalks of New York.\n\nThe following year he was \"discovered\" by [[Brian Eno]] while playing in Washington Square Park.  The result was his most widely-recognized release, [[Day of Radiance|Ambient 3: Day of Radiance]], the third installment of [[Brian Eno| Brian Eno's]] Ambient series.  This was his first album released under the name of Laraaji.\n\nThis international exposure led to many requests for longer versions of his compositions which he supplied to many meditation groups on cassette tapes.  It also resulted in an expansion of his mystic studies with such gurus as [[Swami Satchidananda]] and [[Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati]], founder of the Ananda Ashram in Monroe, New York.\n\nAnother product of Laraaji's increasing enlightenment was the creation of the Laughter Meditation Workshops which he still presents around the globe."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"262673":{"pageid":262673,"ns":0,"title":"Bill Laswell","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{BLP sources|date=May 2008}}\n{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Bill Laswell \n| image                 = Bill-laswell.jpg\n| caption            = Bill Laswell performing at the [[Moers Festival]] in 2006\n| image_size            = <!-- Only for images narrower than 220 pixels -->\n| background          = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name          = \n| alias               = \n| birth_date                = {{Birth date and age|1955|2|12|mf=y}}\n|birth_place =[[Salem, Illinois]], U.S.\n| death_date                = \n| instrument          = Bass guitar, guitar, keyboards\n| genre               = [[Avant-garde music|Avant-garde]], [[art rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[electronica]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[punk jazz]], [[industrial hip hop]]\n| occupation          = Musician, producer, arranger\n| years_active        = \n| label               = \n| associated_acts     = Method Of Defiance, [[The Golden Palominos]], [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]], [[Massacre (experimental band)|Massacre]], [[Material (band)|Material]], [[Buckethead]], [[Painkiller (band)|Painkiller]], [[Ashes (band)|Ashes]], [[Tabla Beat Science]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Herbie Hancock]]\n| website                 = \n| notable_instruments = [[Fender Precision Bass]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://soundcolourvibration.com/2013/05/23/bill-laswell-interview-feature/ | title=Q&A with Bill Laswell | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Bill Laswell''' (born February 12, 1955, [[Salem, Illinois]], and raised in [[Albion, Michigan]]) is an American bassist, producer and [[record label]] owner.\n\nLaswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell's music draws upon many different [[musical genre|genres]], most notably [[funk]], various [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[Dub music|dub]] and [[ambient music|ambient]] styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]].\n\nAccording to music critic Chris Brazier, \"Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silent-watcher.net/billlaswell/ |title=THE Bill Laswell Pages |publisher=Silent-watcher.net |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref> The credo of one record label run by Laswell, and which typifies much of his work, is \"Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted.\" Though projects arranged by Laswell may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically: [[Material (band)|Material]] began as a noisy [[dance music]] project, but subsequent releases have been centered on [[hip hop]], [[jazz]], or backing [[spoken word]] readings by beat generation icon [[William S. Burroughs]]. Similarly, most versions of [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]] have featured guitarist [[Buckethead]], but have explored different permutations with each new album.\n\nThough some artists have chafed against Laswell's distinctive recording and production style (most noticeably some of his for-hire production gigs including [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]) many other collaborations, such as with pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] and singer [[Iggy Pop]] have been lengthier and recurring.

The album features six tracks off his first independent release as well as four new tracks.\n\nloscil followed up the release with ''Submers'', an aquatic-themed album. Each track on the album is named after a [[submarine]]. The last track on the album was produced in honour of the people who died on the [[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk]].\n\nHis 2004 album ''First Narrows'' (a reference to the official name of the Vancouver bridge, also known as [[Lions' Gate Bridge]]) marked the incorporation of improvised performances by a number of guest musicians:<ref>[http://www.straight.com/content.cfm?id=3135] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}</ref> Nyla Raney, [[cello]]; Tim Loewen, [[guitar]]; and Jason Zumpano, [[Rhodes piano]]. Consequently, the songs on ''First Narrows'' are more organic and looser in nature than Morgan's previous work.\n\nEight of his songs were featured on the film score of the 2004 documentary, ''[[ScaredSacred]]'', by the award-winning documentary filmmaker, [[Velcrow Ripper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scaredsacred.org/credits_music.php|title=Scared Sacred: Music Credits|publisher=Scaredsacred.org|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Morgan released ''Stases'', a collection of drones based upon the backgrounds of his work for Kranky Records. The album was made available as a free download-only release from One Records.\n\nThe theme of his fourth major album, released in 2006, continues the conceptual ascent each album has taken, from the sub-atomic level (''Triple Point'') and watery depths (''Submers'') to the surface (''First Narrows'') and the sky (''Plume'').\n\n''Plume'' continues Morgan's musical integration of other musicians' work into his ambient compositions, including Josh August Lindstrom on vibes and [[xylophone]] and Krista Michelle Marshall and Stephen Michael Wood on ebow guitar (as well as Zumpano again on piano)."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"41299536":{"pageid":41299536,"ns":0,"title":"Lotus Plaza","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#REDIRECT [[Lockett Pundt]]\n{{R from move}}"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"1988961":{"pageid":1988961,"ns":0,"title":"Lull (band)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=June 2009}}\n{{Notability|date=June 2009}}\n}}\n{{merge|Mick Harris|date=January 2012}}'''Lull''' is a [[dark ambient]] side-project of [[Mick Harris]]. \nLull was conceived in late '91 by former [[Napalm Death]] drummer Mick Harris (who also created the ambient dub outfit [[Scorn (band)|Scorn]]) in an attempt to create music that would stretch, if not forsake entirely, the structures of conventional music by developing and exploring sound without beats. Harris' initial foray as Lull into low frequency sound exploration was issued in late '92 under the title Dreamt About Dreaming on the respected underground [[Sentrax]] label. In between his Scorn commitments, the ever prolific Harris continued to develop Lull by recording and releasing scores of 7's and compilation tracks, as well as two more full-lengths that each punctuated another stage of his progression.\nLull favours sombre, minimalistic drones that create a dark, other-worldly atmosphere. Its sound is generally amusical, and very experimental.

At age 6, Lynch began studying the piano until age 12, where he was inspired by the music of [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]]\u2019s classical recordings and decided to pursue a career in music. He attended both [[St. Stephen's Episcopal School, Austin, Texas|St. Stephen's Episcopal School]] as well as [[Austin High School (Austin, Texas)|Austin High School]] in [[Austin, Texas]], then attended the main campus of [[University of Texas]] for one year before moving to [[Barcelona, Spain]] where he apprenticed to the classical guitar teacher, Eduardo Sainz de la Maza, for three years.<ref name=lynch/> Leaving Spain, Lynch then returned to the [[University of Texas]] where he studied music composition. While at college Lynch was invited to New York City to join The Renaissance Quartet where he performed the classical guitar and [[lute]] for several years.<ref name=lynch/>\n\nIn the early days of his musical career, Lynch began writing instrumental recordings that blended classical and electronic components into melodic soundscapes. His debut album, ''[[The Sky of Mind]]'' (1983) artfully meshed his early classical music training with spatial melodies, and the album became an underground success. When Lynch released his second album ''[[Deep Breakfast]]'' (1984), he and his wife Kathleen sold over 50,000 albums out of their small apartment in [[San Rafael, California]] before licensing the music to a distributor.<ref name=lynch/> ''[[Deep Breakfast]]'' has sold over 1.4 million copies without the benefits of live performances or videos, and was the first independently released album to be certified Platinum by the R.I.A.A.<ref name=riaa>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=Deep%20Breakfast&artist=Ray%20Lynch&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2007&sort=Artist&perPage=25 RIAA Gold & Platinum Database]</ref> \"The Oh Of Pleasure\" from the album was used for years as the theme for [[Art Bell]]'s ''Dreamland'' radio show.\n\nLynch's third album ''[[No Blue Thing]]'' (1989) won two [[Billboard Awards]], and in 1993, Lynch followed up with his fourth album, the classical ''[[Nothing Above My Shoulders but the Evening]]'' featuring members of the [[San Francisco Symphony]].

They disbanded in the late 1990s after releasing a number of limited-edition records. They released music on labels such as [[Old Europa Cafe]], [[Ant-Zen]], [[Staalplaat]], and [[Soleilmoon]].\n\nStefan and Martin continued under the name of [[Troum]], while Helge is recording as Tausendschoen. Stefan Knappe is also the founder and owner of [[Drone Records]].\n\nGerman band Maeror Tri was founded in April 1988 by Stefan Knappe. The group consisted of three members who only used electric guitars and tons of processing devices to create their droning soundscapes. Their music borrowed elements from Industrial, [[Avant-garde|Avantgarde]], Minimalism and [[New Age]] meditation to reach a new form of transcendentalism.\n\nVery little is known about their origins, even the identity of the band\u2019s members remains vague, except for Stefan Knappe, the group's spokesperson and also owner of the label Drone Records. Nevertheless it is for sure that all three members origin from the city [[Leer]] in northern Germany and know each other since their time in school.\n\nThe name they chose is probably an incorrect Latin expression that may be better translated as \"The Mourning Three\" or \"The Grieving Three\".\n\n\"Dedicated To A New Dawn\", their first cassette, was self-released on their own Baracken Records in 1988, soon followed by many more cassette works on labels like ZNS, Tonspur and Audiofile, and a lot of compilations appearances.\n\nIn 1993 Korm Plastics (a label ran by Frans de Waard) released the very first \"overground\" Maeror Tri album \"Multiple Personality Disorder\" a concept CD divided in four long parts recorded back in 1991 that fully showcase their mastery in distorting and layering guitar sounds. It was soon followed by \"Meditamentum\", a collection of selected tape tracks recorded from 1988 to 1993.\n\n\"Myein\", a monumental work recorded between 1992 and 1993, was released on americal label ND in 1995. This work presented three long tracks that well exemplify some of the aspects of their art: the gothic droning of \"Phlogiston\", the ambient-electronica of \"Desiderium\", and the cosmic doodling of the 47 minutes long title track.\n\n\"Language of Flames and Sound\", released on Italian label Old Europa Cafe in 1996, continued to chronicle the group's evolution into more abstract domains.\n\nIn late 1996, as the group was about to break into the growing experimental electronica scene, one member of the band, Helge Siehl, decided to quit, leaving Knappe and his other partner to continue as the duo Troum.\n\n\"Mort aux Vaches\", a symphony in three movements and the group's installment in Staalplaat's series of experimental electronica, and \"Emotional Engramm\" (on Iris Light), probably their most accessible recording, were both released posthumous in 1997.\n\nArchive material has continued to surface over the years after the group ceased to exist: a second volume of \"Meditamentum\", released on Manifold in 1999, salvaged more material from the early years limited edition cassettes, while the \"Hypnotikum I\" and \"Hypnotikum II\" LPs are valid examples of the group's live attitude."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"3902740":{"pageid":3902740,"ns":0,"title":"Main (band)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Main\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = \n| genre               = [[Ambient music]], [[experimental music]], [[post-rock]], [[dark ambient]], [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]]<ref name=\"genres\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=main-p44814|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic entry for Main|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n| years_active        = 1991 - present\n| label               = [[Beggars Banquet Records]], [[Sub Rosa (label)|Sub Rosa]], K-Raa-K, [[Staalplaat]]\n| associated_acts     = [[Loop (band)|Loop]], [[Robert Hampson]], [[The Hair and Skin Trading Company]]\n| website                 = \n| past_members        = Scott Dowson\n| current_members        = [[Robert Hampson]]<br />[[Stephan Mathieu]]\n}}\n\n'''Main''' were a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ambient music|ambient]] band formed in 1991 by the guitarists [[Robert Hampson]] and Scott Dowson, the former members of [[Loop (band)|Loop]].

Makyo is essentially synonymous with illusion, but especially in reference to experiences that can occur within meditation practice.\n\nIn Philip Kapleau's ''The Three Pillars of Zen'',<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kapleau\n| first = Philip\n| authorlink = Philip Kapleau\n| title = The Three Pillars of Zen\n| year = 1967 }}</ref> Yasutani Roshi explained the term as the combination of '''''ma''''' meaning devil and '''''kyo''''' meaning the objective world.  This character for \u201cdevil\u201d can also refer to [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], the Buddhist \u201ctempter\u201d figure; and the character ''kyo'' can mean simply region, condition or place. Makyo refers to the hallucinations and perceptual distortions that can arise during the course of meditation and can be mistaken by the practitioner as \"seeing the true nature\" or [[kensho]]. [[Zen master]]s warn their meditating students to ignore sensory distortions. These can occur in the form of visions and perceptual distortions, but they can also be experiences of blank, trance-like absorption states. In the Zen school, it is understood that neither category of experience \u2013 however fascinating they may be \u2013 is a true and final enlightenment.\n\nContemplative literature contains numerous descriptions of the perceptual distortion produced by meditation. It is characterized in some schools as \"going to the movies,\" a sign of spiritual intensity but a phenomenon that is considered distinctly inferior to the clear insight of settled practice. In some [[Hindu]] schools it is regarded as a product of the sukshma sharira, or \"experience body,\" in its unstable state, and in that respect is seen to be another form of [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], which is the illusory nature of the world as apprehended by ordinary consciousness.\n\nTibetan contemplative literature uses the parallel term ''nyam'', which fall into three categories, usually listed as clarity, bliss, and non-conceptuality.  Many types of meditation phenomena can be classed under this rubric, and are generally tied to the reorganization of the body's subtle energies that can occur in meditation.  See Dudjom Lingpa, (cited in Wallace, the Attention Revolution), and Padmasambhava (in Treasures from the Juniper Ridge) for more specific examples.  Robert Aitken Roshi classifies speaking in tongues as \"elaborate makyo\" (Taking the Path of Zen)."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"707989":{"pageid":707989,"ns":0,"title":"Mana ERG","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Mana ERG''' is the musical project of ex recording engineer and multi-instrumentalist Bruno De Angelis.

He studied analog synthesis at [[Long Beach City College|Long Beach Community College]] eventually moving to [[San Diego State University]] where he was exposed to tape manipulation and tape composition techniques. He also began performing and studying Balinese gamelan music, and the [[microtonal]] composition of [[Harry Partch]]. From San Diego, Loren moved to [[California State University Dominguez Hills]] where he delved into computer synthesis, utilizing their [[Synclavier]] system.\n\nAfter mastering the techniques he learned in school, he developed his own studio, stocking it with an array of vintage sound modules as well as the latest technology. He has worked in the music industry as a sound designer including a position at Oberheim Electronics, a synthesizer manufacturer, and as a recording engineer.\n\nLoren received a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology and Geography from [[Cal Poly Pomona]] and a Master of Arts degree in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[UCLA]].

Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live shows]], they are one of the most [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful]] and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by students [[Syd Barrett]], [[Nick Mason]], [[Roger Waters]], and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' (1967). [[David Gilmour]] joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 due to deteriorating [[mental health]] exacerbated by drug use. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and, by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the [[concept album|concepts]] behind their critically and commercially successful albums ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977), ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983).\n\nWright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985, declaring it a \"spent force\". Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd; Wright rejoined them as a session musician and, later, a band member. The three produced two more albums, ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994), and toured until 1994. After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event [[Live 8]], but Gilmour and Waters have since stated they have no plans to reunite as a band again. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. The final Pink Floyd studio album, ''[[The Endless River]],'' recorded without Waters and based on material recorded in 1993\u20131994, was released in November 2014.\n\nPink Floyd were inducted into the US [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005.

With Wilson still in charge of [[guitar]] and [[lead vocals]], this would remain the lineup until 2001, when the band recruited [[Gavin Harrison]] to replace Maitland on drums.\n\nPorcupine Tree's early sound evokes a style of [[psychedelic rock]] comparable to that of [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]]. Upon signing with  [[Kscope]] [[record label]] in the late 1990s, the band approached a more mainstream [[alternative rock]] sound. By the early  2000s, the band signed to a [[major record label]] and shifted their sound again, this time in a more [[progressive metal]] direction.\n\nAfter the release and tour in support of their tenth studio album, ''[[The Incident (album)|The Incident]]'', the band became inactive as Wilson began to focus on his solo career. While not formally broken up, they also have no particular reformation plans beyond \"someday\", with members all working on separate projects, and Wilson committing himself to his solo work through most of 2015."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"3269137":{"pageid":3269137,"ns":0,"title":"Puff Dragon","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"'''Puff Dragon''' is a [[downtempo]] and [[ambient music]] project by Steve Good.

The band underwent many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only continuous member. Drummer and composer [[Klaus Schulze]] was briefly a member of an early lineup, but the most stable version of the group, during their influential mid-1970s period, was as a trio with Froese, [[Christopher Franke]], and [[Peter Baumann]]. In the late 1970s, [[Johannes Schmoelling]] replaced Baumann, and this lineup, too, was stable and extremely productive.\n\nTangerine Dream released more than one hundred albums. Their early \"Pink Years\" albums had a pivotal role in the development of [[Krautrock]]. Their \"Virgin Years\" albums helped define what became known as the [[Berlin School of electronic music]]. These and later albums were influential in the development of [[electronic dance music]], and also the genre known as [[new-age music]], though the band themselves disliked the term. From the late 1990s into the 2000s, Tangerine Dream also explored some styles of [[electronica]].\n\nAlthough the group released numerous studio and live recordings, a substantial number of their fans were introduced to Tangerine Dream by their film soundtracks, which total over sixty and include ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]],'' ''[[Thief (film)|Thief]],'' ''[[The Keep (film)|The Keep]],'' ''[[Risky Business]],'' ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]],'' ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]],'' ''[[Near Dark]],'' ''[[Shy People]]'', and ''[[Miracle Mile (film)|Miracle Mile]]''.

He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in [[extreme metal]] band [[Strapping Young Lad]] from 1994 to 2007 and has had an extensive career as a solo artist.\n\nAfter performing in a number of [[heavy metal music|metal]] bands in [[education in Canada|high school]], Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on [[Steve Vai]]'s album ''[[Sex & Religion]]''. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]'' released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]'' in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.\n\nTownsend's solo albums, a diverse mix of [[hard rock]], [[progressive metal]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[New-age music|new-age]], have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed '''the Devin Townsend Band''', a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, he disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and the Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began recording again, and soon announced the formation of the '''Devin Townsend Project'''. The project began with a series of four albums, released from 2009 to 2011, each written in a different style, and Townsend continues to record and tour under the new moniker.\n\nAcross all his bands and projects, Townsend has released twenty studio albums and three live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked [[wall of sound]], has been compared to the styles of [[Phil Spector]] and [[Frank Zappa]]. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from [[screaming (music)|screaming]] to an opera-esque [[clean vocals|singing]], and his songwriting is similarly diverse.
