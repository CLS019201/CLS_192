\'\'\'The Allman Brothers Band\'\'\' was an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] in 1969 by brothers [[Duane Allman]] (slide guitar and lead guitar) and [[Gregg Allman]] (vocals, keyboards, songwriting), as well as [[Dickey Betts]] (lead guitar, vocals, songwriting), [[Berry Oakley]] (bass guitar), [[Butch Trucks]] (drums), and [[Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson]] (drums). While the band has been called the principal architects of [[southern rock]], they also incorporate elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music]], and their live shows have [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.

The group\'s first two studio releases stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release, \'\'[[At Fillmore East]]\'\', represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of their songs "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]" and "[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]", and is often considered among the best [[live album]]s. Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident not long afterward, and the band completed \'\'[[Eat a Peach]]\'\' (1972) in his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band\'s popularity. Following the death of bassist Berry Oakley later that year, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973\'s \'\'[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]\'\', which, combined with the [[hit single]], "[[Ramblin\' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin\' Man]]", placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook the band soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.

The band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of their drummer), and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at [[New York City]]\'s [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] each spring. The band retired in 2014 with the departure of the aforementioned members. The band has been awarded eleven gold and five platinum albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2012-02-27}}</ref> and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' ranked them 52nd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2004.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher = Rolling Stone| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7235465/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_52_the_allman_brothers_band | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090517075311/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7235465/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_52_the_allman_brothers_band | archivedate = 2009-05-17 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref>

==History==

===Pre-history and formation (1965\xe2\x80\x9369)===
[[Image:AllmanBrosMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|"[[The Allman Brothers Band Museum|The Big House]]," seen here in 2009. The band lived at the house in the early 1970s.]]
Duane and Gregg Allman, his younger brother, grew up in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona]], [[Florida]], where they first discovered music. Gregg was first to pick up the guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, dropping out of high school to practice constantly.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} The duo first formed the Escorts, which evolved into the [[Allman Joys]] in the mid-1960s.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=18}} When an African-American friend introduced Gregg to R&B and soul music, they began to incorporate it into their sound. By 1967, the group spent time in [[St. Louis]], where a [[Los Angeles]]-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], cutting two unsuccessful albums for [[Liberty Records]].<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=46}} Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama|Muscle Shoals]], [[Alabama]], while Gregg stayed behind in [[Hollywood]] bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=90}} The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in [[Miami]], producing an album-length demo with [[the 31st of February]], a group that included drummer [[Butch Trucks]].{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=99}}

At [[FAME Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist, recording with artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]].<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=6}} Duane suggested to [[Wilson Pickett]] they record a cover of \xe2\x80\x9c[[Hey Jude]]\xe2\x80\x9d by [[the Beatles]]; the single went to number 23 on the national charts.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=88}} FAME signed Duane to a five-year recording contract, and he put together a group, including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby. Duane recruited [[Jai Johanny Johanson]] (Jaimoe) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery, and the two moved into his home on the [[Tennessee River]]. Allman invited bassist [[Berry Oakley]] to jam with the new group; the pair had met in a [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] club some time earlier, and became quick friends.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} The group had immediate chemistry, and Duane\'s vision for a "different" band \xe2\x80\x94 one with two lead guitarists and two drummers \xe2\x80\x94 began evolving.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} Meanwhile, [[Phil Walden]], the manager of the late [[Otis Redding]] and several other R&B acts, was looking to expand into rock acts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=9}} Rick Hall became frustrated with the group\xe2\x80\x99s recording methods, and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who purchased them for $10,000.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=110}} Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic-distributed label, [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=13}}

Duane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969, as Duane had become frustrated with being a "robot" of those at FAME.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=27}} He invited anyone who wanted to join to the jam sessions that birthed the Allman Brothers Band. [[Dickey Betts]] had played in Oakley\xe2\x80\x99s previous band, the Second Coming, and became the group\xe2\x80\x99s second lead guitarist, while [[Butch Trucks]], with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior, fulfilled the role of the second drummer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The Second Coming\'s [[Reese Wynans]] played keyboards, and Duane, Oakley and Betts all shared vocal duties.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville, with an ever-changing, rotating cast of musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=24}} Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group (which effectively eliminated Wynans\' position, as Gregg also played keyboards).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=25}} Gregg made it down and entered rehearsal on March 26, 1969, when the group was rehearsing "[[Trouble No More (song)|Trouble No More]]" by [[Muddy Waters]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=28}} Although initially intimidated by the musicians, Duane pressured his brother into "into singing [his] guts out."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Four days later, the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Although many names were kicked around, including [[Beelzebub]], the six-piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=109}}

===Debut and early years (1969\xe2\x80\x9370)===

The group moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] by May 1, where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} Mike Callahan and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph \xe2\x80\x9cRed Dog\xe2\x80\x9d Campbell]] became the band\xe2\x80\x99s early crew members. "Red Dog" was a disabled [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] who donated his monthly disability checks to the band\'s cause.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=118}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}} In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon\'s apartment on 309 College Street, which became known as the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=33}}  "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out," said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=39}}  Living on very little funds, they found a friend in "Mama Louise" Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H&H Soul Food Restaurant, who fed the band (they would repay her when they returned from touring).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}} The band\'s image was radical in the just [[Racial integration|barely integrated]] Macon: "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," said Hudson.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=34}} The band performed locally, as well as eighty miles north in [[Atlanta]]\'s [[Piedmont Park]], and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}}

The group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming [[psychedelic drugs]], and hanging out in [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]], where they would write songs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} Their first performances outside the [[Southern United States|South]] came on May 30 and 31 in [[Boston]], opening for [[The Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=46}} In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers like "Trouble No More" and "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]", in addition to improvised jams such as "[[Mountain Jam]]".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=41}} Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band\'s sole songwriter, composing songs such as \xe2\x80\x9c[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]" and \xe2\x80\x9cBlack-Hearted Woman.\xe2\x80\x9d{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=42}}  The band set off for [[New York City]] in August 1969, where they had arranged to work with [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[John Coltrane]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who was unavailable. As a result Atlantic house engineer [[Adrian Barber]] stepped in to record the sessions in his first producer credit.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} \'\'[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]\'\' was recorded and mixed in two weeks,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} and recording was a positive experience for the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=52}} New York became regarded within the group as their "second home."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=51}} \'\'The Allman Brothers Band\'\' saw release in November 1969 through [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]],{{sfn|Freeman|1996|p=59}} but received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=64}}

Executives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to "acclimate" them to the industry. "They wanted us to act \'like a rock band\' and we just told them to fuck themselves," remembered Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} For their part, the members of the band remained optimistic, electing to stay in [[Southern United States|the South]]. "Everyone told us we\'d fall by the wayside down there," said Gregg Allman,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=65}} but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=66}} The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of [[New York City]]\'s [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was "where the brotherhood came to pass," according to roadie Kim Payne; "There was a pact made out there around a campfire\xe2\x80\x94all for one and one for all. [\xe2\x80\xa6] Everybody believed [in the band] 100 percent."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Much of the material presented on the band\'s second album, \'\'[[Idlewild South]]\'\', originated at the cabin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} Oakley\'s wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed "the Big House" in March 1970.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=71}}

===Live reputation, \'\'At Fillmore East\'\' and breakthrough (1970\xe2\x80\x9371)===
[[Image:Duane Allmann.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Duane Allman]], the group\'s leader, was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1971.]]
The band played continuously in 1970, performing over 300 dates on the road traveling in a Ford Econoline van and later, a Winnebago, nicknamed the Wind Bag.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=144}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=99}} Walden doubted the band\xe2\x80\x99s future, worrying whether they would ever catch on, but word of mouth spread due to the band\'s relentless touring schedule, and crowds got larger.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} The close proximity of the Winnebago brought about heavy drug use within the group, and all in the group, with the exception of the brothers, were struggling to make a living.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=101}} In one instance, touring member Twiggs Lyndon stabbed and killed a promoter for not paying the band; he later claimed temporary insanity.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=103}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=139}} Later that year, Duane accidentally overdosed on opium after a show.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=108}}  \'\'Idlewild South\'\', produced by Tom Dowd, was recorded gradually over a period of five months in various cities, including [[New York City|New York]], [[Miami]], and Macon, and contained two of the band\'s best-known songs, "[[Midnight Rider]]" (later a hit for various artists) and "[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]", which became one of the band\'s famous concert numbers.<ref name="AM"/>

\'\'Idlewild South\'\' was issued by [[Atco Records|Atco]] and [[Capricorn Records]] in September 1970, less than a year after their debut.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=92}} The album sold only "marginally better than its predecessor, though the band had a growing national reputation and the album included songs that would become staples of the band\'s repertoire\xe2\x80\x94and eventually of rock radio."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=94}} Shortly after completing recording, Duane was contacted by guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] to contribute to his new project, [[Derek and the Dominos]]. Allman was a huge fan of his work with [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and Clapton had been blown away by Allman\'s session work on [[Wilson Pickett]]\'s "[[Hey Jude]]" some years prior.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=82}} They met after a show one night in [[Miami]] and jammed together until the next afternoon,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=83}} with the two guitarists regarding one another as "instant soulmates."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=84}} Clapton invited Duane to join Derek and the Dominos, and by several accounts he considered it; in the end, he declined the offer and rejoined the Allman Brothers Band, returning after missing a string of several shows.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=88}} The sessions were collected on \'\'[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]\'\', issued that November.

Their fortunes began to change over the course of 1971, where the band\'s average earnings doubled.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=115}} "We realized that the audience was a big part of what we did, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be duplicated in a studio. A lightbulb finally went off; we needed to make a live album," said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} \'\'[[At Fillmore East]]\'\' was recorded over three nights \xe2\x80\x94 March 11, 12, and 13, 1971 \xe2\x80\x94 at the [[Fillmore East]] in New York, for which the band was paid a nightly $1,250.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=117}} \'\'At Fillmore East\'\' was released in July 1971 by [[Capricorn Records]] as a [[double album]], "people-priced" for the cost of a single LP.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=124}} While previous albums by the band had taken months to hit the charts (often near the bottom of the top 200), the record started to climb the charts after a matter of days.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} \'\'At Fillmore East\'\' peaked at number thirteen on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'{{\'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top Pop Albums]] chart, and was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] that October, becoming their commercial and artistic breakthrough.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=187}} The album is considered among the best live albums of all-time, and was later selected for preservation in the [[Library of Congress]], deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" by the [[National Recording Registry]].

===\'\'Eat a Peach\'\' and Duane Allman and Berry Oakley\'s deaths (1971\xe2\x80\x9372)===

Although suddenly very wealthy and successful, much of the band and its entourage now struggled with [[heroin]] addiction. Four individuals \xe2\x80\x94 group leader [[Duane Allman]], bassist [[Berry Oakley]], and roadies Robert Payne and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph "Red Dog" Campbell]] \xe2\x80\x94 checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=147}} On October 29, 1971, Duane Allman, then 24, was killed in a motorcycle accident one day after returning to Macon. Allman was riding his motorcycle at a high speed at the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Bartlett Street as a [[flatbed truck]] carrying a lumber crane approached.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The flatbed truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing Allman to swerve his [[Harley-Davidson Sportster]] motorcycle sharply to the left to avoid a collision. As he was doing so, he struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the lumber crane and was immediately thrown from the motorcycle.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} The motorcycle bounced into the air, landed on Allman and skidded another 90 feet with Allman pinned underneath, crushing his [[internal organs]].{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=210}} Though he was alive when he arrived at the hospital, despite immediate emergency surgery, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=160}}

After Duane\'s death, the band held a meeting on their future; it was clear all wanted to continue, and after a short period, the band returned to the road.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=162}} "We all had this thing in us and Duane put it there. He was the teacher and he gave something to us\xe2\x80\x94his disciples\xe2\x80\x94that we had to play out," said drummer [[Butch Trucks]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=165}} The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on their third studio album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=167}} Completing the recording of \'\'[[Eat a Peach]]\'\' raised each members\' spirits; "The music brought life back to us all, and it was simultaneously realized by every one of us. We found strength, vitality, newness, reason, and belonging as we worked on finishing \'\'Eat a Peach\'\'," said Allman.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=204}} "Those last three songs [\xe2\x80\xa6] just kinda floated right on out of us [...] The music was still good, it was still rich, and it still had that energy\xe2\x80\x94it was still the Allman Brothers Band."{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=204}} Released in February 1972, \'\'Eat a Peach\'\' was the band\'s second hit album, shipping [[RIAA certification|gold]] and peaking at number four on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'{{\'s}} [[Billboard 200|Top 200 Pop Albums]] chart.<ref name="AM"/> "We\'d been through hell, but somehow we were rolling bigger than ever," said Gregg Allman.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=210}}

The band performed nearly 90 shows in the following year, touring as a five-piece.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=173}} The band also purchased 432 acres of land in [[Juliette, Georgia|Juliette]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for $160,000 and nicknamed it "the Farm"; it soon became a group hangout and fulfilled bassist [[Berry Oakley]]\'s communal dreams.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=175}} Oakley, however, was visibly suffering from the death of his friend: he excessively drank and consumed drugs, and was losing weight quickly.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=185}} According to friends and family, he appeared to have lost "all hope, his heart, his drive, his ambition, [and] his direction" following Duane\xe2\x80\x99s death.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=187}} "Everything Berry had envisioned for everybody\xe2\x80\x94including the crew, the women and children\xe2\x80\x94was shattered on the day Duane died, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t care after that," said [[roadie]] Kim Payne.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} Oakley repeatedly wished to "get high, be high, and stay high," causing quiet concern from all those around him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=186}} On November 11, 1972, slightly inebriated and overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=189}} He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of [[Traumatic brain injury|cerebral swelling]] caused by a fractured skull.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=190}} Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Macon, Georgia)|Rose Hill Cemetery]] in Macon, Georgia.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=194}}

[[Image:Gregg Allman 1975.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Vocalist [[Gregg Allman]] on the band\'s 1975 tour.]]
The band unanimously decided to carry on and arrange auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked [[Lamar Williams]], an old friend of drummer [[Jai Johanny Johanson]]\'s from [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Mississippi]], two years removed from an Army stint in [[Vietnam]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=199}} [[Chuck Leavell]] was asked to play [[piano]] for Allman\xe2\x80\x99s solo album, \'\'[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]\'\' (1973), and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=179}} Dickey Betts became the group\'s \'\'[[de facto]]\'\' leader during the recording process. "It\'s not like Dickey came in and said, \'I\'m taking over. I\'m the boss. Do this and that.\' It wasn\'t overt; it was still supposedly a democracy but Dickey started doing more and more of the songwriting," said road manager Willie Perkins.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=182}} \'\'[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]\'\' was an enormous success, peaking at number one, resulting in the band becoming "the most popular band in the country."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=225}} "[[Ramblin\' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin\' Man]]", Betts\' [[country music|country]]-infused number, received interest from radio stations immediately, and it rose to number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].<ref name="AM"/>

The Allman Brothers Band returned to touring, playing larger venues, receiving more profit and dealing with less friendship, miscommunication and spiraling drug problems.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=211}} This culminated in a backstage brawl when the band played with [[the Grateful Dead]] at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]\'s [[RFK Stadium]] in June 1973, which resulted in the firing of three of the band\'s longtime [[road crew|roadies]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=215}} The band played arenas and stadiums almost solely as their drug use escalated. In 1974, the band was regularly making $100,000 per show, and was renting [[the Starship]], a customized [[Boeing 720]]B used by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[the Rolling Stones]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=230}} "When [we] got that goddamn plane, it was the beginning of the end," said Allman. Both Allman and Betts released top 20 solo albums in 1974 (\'\'[[The Gregg Allman Tour]]\'\' and \'\'[[Highway Call]]\'\').<ref name=rs>Serpick, Evan (2001). \'\'The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\'\'. New York: [[Simon & Schuster]], 1136 pp. First edition, 2001.</ref> The sessions that produced 1975\'s \'\'[[Win, Lose or Draw (album)|Win, Lose or Draw]]\'\', the last album by the original Allman Brothers Band, were disjointed and inconsistent; Gregg Allman was largely living in Los Angeles and dating pop star [[Cher]], and was, according to biographer Alan Paul, "[becoming] more [[famous for being famous]] than for his music."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=234}} His vocals were recorded there, as he could not be bothered to return to Macon much.<ref name="AM"/> Upon its release, it was considered subpar and sold less than its predecessor; the band later remarked that they were "embarrassed" about the album.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=236}}
[[Image:Sea Level - Chuck Leavell (color fix).jpg|thumb|right|Keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] contributed to Allman\'s solo album, \'\'[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]\'\' (1973), and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well.]]
From August 1975 to May 1976, the Allman Brothers Band played 41 shows to some of the biggest crowds of their career.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=262}} Gradually, the members of the band grew apart during these tours, with sound checks and rehearsals "[becoming] a thing of the past."{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=262}} Allman later pointed to a benefit for presidential candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] as the only real "high point" in an otherwise "rough, rough tour." The shows were considered lackluster and the members were excessive in their drug use.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}}{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=268}} The "breaking point" came when Gregg Allman testified in the trial of security man Scooter Herring.<ref name="AM"/> Bandmates considered him a "snitch," and he received death threats, leading to law-enforcement protection.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} Herring was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to distribute [[cocaine]] and received a 75-year prison sentence, which were later overturned as he received a lesser sentence.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} For his part, Allman always maintained that Herring had told him to take the deal and he would take the fall for it, but nevertheless, the band refused to communicate with him.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=237}} As a result, the band finally broke up; Leavell, Williams, and Jaimoe continued playing together in [[Sea Level (band)|Sea Level]], Betts formed Great Southern, and Allman founded the [[Gregg Allman Band]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} The 1976 live album \'\'[[Wipe the Windows, Check the Oil, Dollar Gas]]\'\' was seen as "the last gasp of a dying band," which was unfortunate for the now-foundering Capricorn Records, who desperately needed the band together to stay afloat.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=241}}

===First reunion, subsequent break-up, and interim years (1979\xe2\x80\x9388)===
Allman and Walden first approached the idea of a reunion to Betts in 1978.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} Their first public appearance together came at a Great Southern show in New York\'s [[Central Park]] that summer, when Allman, Trucks and Jaimoe joined the band for a few songs.<ref name="rs"/> Williams and Leavall declined to leave Sea Level, so the Allman Brothers Band hired two new members: guitarist [[Dan Toler]] and bassist David Goldflies.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=245}} The band reunited with Tom Dowd at Criteria Studios in Miami to cut their reunion album, which saw release in February 1979 as \'\'[[Enlightened Rogues]]\'\', a term Duane had used to describe the band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=246}} While the band "tried to make it happen," they later concluded that the chemistry was not there; the album was a minor commercial success, which was credited to the production work from Dowd.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts filed a lawsuit against Walden for nonpayment of record and publishing royalties, and Betts\' lawyer, Steve Massarsky, began managing the group.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=247}} Betts won, and the rest of the band filed suit as Capricorn declared bankruptcy that October.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=292}} Massarsky led the band to sign with [[Arista Records|Arista]], who pushed the band to "modernize" their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} "[Arista founder] [[Clive Davis]] destroyed any hope that we had that we could make the thing work again," said Trucks later. "He wanted us to be a Southern American version of [[Led Zeppelin]] and brought in outside producers and it just kept getting worse."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}}

Their first Arista effort, \'\'[[Reach for the Sky (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Reach for the Sky]]\'\' (1980), was produced by Nashville songwriters Mike Lawler and Johnny Cobb.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} [[Bonnie Bramlett]], who toured with the band near the end of the decade, sang lead on one song.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=253}} Lawler soon became a part of the band\'s touring ensemble, incorporating center-stage [[keytar]] solos "that most fans consider the band\'s nadir."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} Drugs remained a problem with the band, particularly among Betts and Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=251}} Although the album was made with the intention of creating a [[hit single]], the genre of [[southern rock]] was waning considerably in the mainstream.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=254}} The band again grew apart, firing longtime roadie "Red Dog" and replacing Jaimoe with Toler\'s brother Frankie, who had been a member of Great Southern.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} The main point of contention was his insistence that his wife and manager, Candace Oakley (Berry\'s sister), handle his business affairs.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=256}} "One of the real blights on the history of the Allman Brothers Band was that Jaimoe, this gentle man, was fired from this organization," said Allman later.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=297}} Not long after, "the band changed managers, hiring the promoter John Scher after Massarsky eased himself out, reportedly saying, \'It\xe2\x80\x99s a million-dollar headache and a quarter-million-dollar job.\'"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=258}}

For their second and final album with Arista, \'\'[[Brothers of the Road]]\'\', they collaborated with a "name producer" (John Ryan, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and [[the Doobie Brothers]]), who pushed the band even harder to change their sound.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=260}} "[[Straight from the Heart (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Straight from the Heart]]" was the album\'s single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group\'s last appearance on the top 40 charts.<ref name="rs"/> The band, considering their post-reunion albums "embarrassing," subsequently broke-up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} "We broke up in \'82 because we decided we better just back out or we would ruin what was left of the band\xe2\x80\x99s image," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=262}} The band\'s final performance came on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' in January 1982, where they performed "Southbound" and "Leavin\'."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=263}} The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=265}} Allman\'s solo career began looking upward when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, \'\'[[I\'m No Angel (album)|I\'m No Angel]]\'\'. The [[I\'m No Angel (1987 song)|title track]] became a surprise hit on radio, garnering heavy airplay.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=266}}

===Second reunion and heavy touring (1989\xe2\x80\x9396)===
[[Image:Govt. Mule - Warren Haynes.jpg|thumb|left|Guitarist [[Warren Haynes]], seen here in the late 1990s, joined the band for their second reunion.]]
The Allman Brothers Band celebrated its twentieth anniversary in 1989, and the band reunited for a summer tour, with Jaimoe once again on drums.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} In addition, they featured guitarist [[Warren Haynes]] and pianist [[Johnny Neel]], both from the Dickey Betts Band, and bassist [[Allen Woody]], who was hired after open auditions held at Trucks\'s Florida studio.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=269}} The [[classic rock]] radio format had given the band\'s catalog songs new relevance, as did a multi-CD retrospective box set, \'\'[[Dreams (The Allman Brothers Band album)|Dreams]]\'\'.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=313}} [[Epic Records|Epic]], who had worked with Allman on his solo career, signed the band. Danny Goldberg became the band\'s manager; he had previously worked with acts such as Led Zeppelin and [[Bonnie Raitt]].{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=317}} The group were initially reluctant to tour, but found they performed solidly; in addition, former roadies such as "Red Dog" returned.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=270}} The band returned to the studio with longtime producer Tom Dowd for 1990\'s \'\'[[Seven Turns]]\'\', which was considered a return to form.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=277}} "[[Good Clean Fun (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Good Clean Fun]]" and "[[Seven Turns (song)|Seven Turns]]" each became big hits on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The addition of Haynes and Woody had "reenergized" the ensemble.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=280}} Neel left the group in 1990, and the band added percussionist [[Marc Qui\xc3\xb1ones]], formerly of [[Spyro Gyra]], the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=290}}

The band performed 87 shows in 1991, and 77 the following year.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} The band did not renew Goldberg\'s contract as manager, and as a result, their tour manager, Bert Holman, became the band\'s full-time manager in 1991 and remained so for the rest of their career.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=317}} Their next studio effort, \'\'[[Shades of Two Worlds]]\'\' (1992), produced the crowd favorite "Nobody Knows".{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=293}} The band also released a live album, \'\'[[An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: First Set]]\'\', recorded at their 1992 residency at New York\'s [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=288}} The band performed ten consecutive shows there (establishing themselves as a "New York rite of spring," according to biographer Alan Paul), which set the stage for their return nearly every year afterward.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=288}} The band grew contentious over a 1993 tour, in which Betts was arrested when he shoved two police officers.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=294}} Struggling to find a replacement guitarist, they brought in [[David Grissom]] (then touring with [[John Mellencamp]]), and also Jack Pearson, a Nashville-based friend of Haynes (the original replacement, [[Zakk Wylde]], filled in for a show but his onstage antics did not fit with the band).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=299}} Haynes was both opening with his own band and headlining with the Allman Brothers, and began to consider leaving the group, due to their increasing lack of communication.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=303}}

Despite the growing tension, Haynes remained a member and Betts returned.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=304}} Their third post-reunion record, \'\'[[Where It All Begins]]\'\' (1994), was recorded entirely live.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=304}} "The Allman Brothers was a year-by-year thing. There was no indication that it was capable of staying together for years to come. We all looked at it as each tour could be the last one, and there was no reason to think otherwise," said Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=310}} The band continued to tour with greater frequency, attracting younger generations with their headlining of the [[H.O.R.D.E.|H.O.R.D.E. Festival]].<ref name="rs"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=310}} The group were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1995; Allman was severely inebriated and could not make it through his acceptance speech.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=318}} Seeing the ceremony broadcast on television later, Allman was mortified, providing a catalyst for his final, successful attempt to quit alcohol and substance abuse. During the 1996 run at the Beacon, turmoil came to a breaking point between Allman and Betts, nearly causing a cancellation of a show and causing another band breakup.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=312}} "We were upstairs in our dressing rooms [...] I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting there thinking, \'This is it. This is how it finally ends,\'" said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=314}} Haynes and Woody left to focus on [[Gov\'t Mule]], feeling as though a break was imminent with the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Allman & Light|2012|p=336}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}}

===Later years (1997\xe2\x80\x932014)===
[[Image:Allman Bros opening night at Beacon Theater 2009.jpg|thumb|The band\'s 2009 residency at [[New York]]\'s [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] in celebration of their fortieth anniversary was considered a career highlight.<ref name="rs"/>]]
The group recruited [[Oteil Burbridge]] of the [[Col. Bruce Hampton and The Aquarium Rescue Unit|Aquarium Rescue Unit]] to replace Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=326}} Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=323}} Pearson, struggling with [[tinnitus]], left as a result following the 1999 Beacon run.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=331}} Trucks phoned his nephew, [[Derek Trucks]], to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} Trucks was very young, at age 20, and younger than any of the original members when the band formed. "It was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start," said Derek Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} "When I first got the gig, I was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it, hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=333}} The Beacon run in 2000, captured on \'\'[[Peakin\' at the Beacon]]\'\', was ironically considered among the band\'s worst performances; an eight-show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=341}} "It had ceased to be a band\xe2\x80\x94everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=342}}
[[Image:Derek Trucks- Allman Brothers Band 2009.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Derek Trucks]], nephew of drummer [[Butch Trucks]], joined in 1999 and became the band\'s youngest member.]]
All involved contend that the break was temporary, but Betts responded by hiring a lawyer and suing the group, which led to a permanent divorce.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=344}} "I had no idea that I would be snapped out of the picture. I thought it was cruel and impersonal," said Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=345}} Allman was finally sober and felt more miserable shows with Betts would be a waste of time.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=345}} Betts later received a cash settlement, which is subject to a [[confidentiality agreement]]; he went on to record new music with a new band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=249}} [[Jimmy Herring]] joined the band for the summer tour, where the band fought negative press; fans contended that attending shows by an Allman Brothers Band without Betts was pointless.<ref name="AM"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=351}} Herring exited shortly after the tour, as he felt guilty that he would replace Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=355}} That August, former bassist Allen Woody was found dead in a hotel room in New York.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}} Warren Haynes set up a benefit show for his former bandmate, which featured the Allman Brothers Band. With Derek Trucks unavailable, he sat in for the set.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=358}} In 2001, Haynes rejoined the band for their Beacon run: "It was my first time with the band in four years and it was very comfortable," he remarked.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=359}}

This incarnation of the Allman Brothers Band was well-regarded among fans and the general public, and remained stable and productive.<ref name="AM"/><ref name="rs"/>"This band is the greatest one since Duane and Berry, and why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be?" said Jaimoe.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=365}} The band released their final studio recording, \'\'[[Hittin\' the Note]]\'\' (2003), to critical acclaim.<ref name="rs"/> The record was the first to feature Derek Trucks and the only Allman Brothers album to not feature Betts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=371}} The band continued to tour throughout the 2000s, remaining a top touring act, regularly attracting more than 20,000 fans.<ref name="AM"/> The decade closed with a successful run at the Beacon Theater, in celebration of the band\'s fortieth anniversary.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=379}} "That [2009 run] was the most fun I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in that building," said Allman, and it was universally regarded within the band as a career highlight.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=380}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=381}}<ref name="rs"/> The run featured numerous special guests, including [[Eric Clapton]], which all in the band regarded as the most "special" guest, due to his association with Duane.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=383}} Allman had a liver transplant in 2010, and suffered health setbacks for the following two years.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=389}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=390}} He went to rehab in 2012 for addiction following his medical treatments.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=392}} In 2012 the Allman Brothers started their own music festival, The Peach which features many associated acts and many genres in addition to two Allman Brothers performances. They played a run at the Beacon in 2013 per tradition and after continued to tour.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=392}} In 2014, Haynes and Derek Trucks announced their intention to depart the group at the end of the year.<ref name="RS-Haynes-Trucks">Doyle, Patrick (January 8, 2014).

The Allman Brothers Band have generally been considered one of the pioneering bands in [[southern rock]], although the group distanced themselves from the term.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=232}} Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: "I think it\xe2\x80\x99s limiting. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather just be known as a [[progressive rock]] band from the South. I\xe2\x80\x99m damned proud of who I am and where I\xe2\x80\x99m from, but I hate the term \xe2\x80\x98Southern rock.\xe2\x80\x99 I think calling us that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think are fair."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=232}} The band was certainly at the forefront of the genre\'s popularity in the early 1970s; the breakthrough of \'\'At Fillmore East\'\' led their hometown of Macon to become flooded with "southern rock" groups.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=233}} Despite this, the group has continued to remove themselves from the term. "The problem I have is a lot of people associate it with [[rednecks]] and [[rebel flag]]s and backward mentality. That has never been representative of the Allman Brothers Band," said guitarist Warren Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=233}}

The group largely infused hints of the [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] into their music. They all avidly shared their record collections with one another during the early days of the band.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} For example, Betts was into country music and the guitar work of [[Chuck Berry]], while Trucks was largely into groups such as [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Grateful Dead]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} Duane and Gregg Allman grew infatuated with [[rhythm and blues]] in their teens, collecting records by [[James Brown]], [[B.B. King]], [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]], and [[Howlin\' Wolf]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=3}} Drummer [[Jai Johanny Johanson|Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson]] largely introduced the group to [[jazz]]. While Betts commented that he was interested in artists such as [[Howard Roberts]] prior, Jaimoe "really fired us up on it," introducing his bandmates to [[Miles Davis]] and [[John Coltrane]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} Duane Allman was also inspired by Howard Roberts, [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Tal Farlow]], and [[Kenny Burrell]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=60}} The source of the band\'s modal jamming in their earliest days came from Coltrane\xe2\x80\x99s rendition of "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]" and Davis\'s "[[All Blues]],"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=61}} which Jaimoe occasionally stole from: "I did a lot of copying, but only from the best."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=56}}

Duane Allman created the idea of having two lead guitarists, which was inspired by [[Curtis Mayfield]]; "[he] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=61}} Their style and incorporation of guitar [[harmonies]] was very influential on later musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns with each other and with the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} Dickey Betts\' playing was very melody-based; "My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I\xe2\x80\x99m such a melody guy that even when I\xe2\x80\x99m playing the blues, I go for melody first," he said.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=63}} His listening of country and string [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] growing up influenced this considerably: "I played [[mandolin]], [[ukulele]], and [[fiddle]] before I ever touched a guitar, which may be where a lot of the major keys I play come from."{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=68}} He later characterized their style as "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," which involved allowing each musician\'s downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines, as well.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=69}}

The group also held an [[improvisational]] approach to live performances, which connected the band with [[jam band]] culture. "Jazz and blues musicians have been doing this for decades, but I think they really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music," said Haynes.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=69}} "We sure didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be a "jam band" but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to just play three minutes and be over," said Allman.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=121}} \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' referred to the group as "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached."<ref name="rs1"/>

==Legacy==
The Allman Brothers Band were considerably influential within the Southern United States. Their arrival on the musical scene paved the way for several other notable [[southern rock]] acts \xe2\x80\x94 among those [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[the Marshall Tucker Band]] and [[Wet Willie (band)|Wet Willie]] \xe2\x80\x94 to achieve commercial success, and also "almost single-handedly" made [[Capricorn Records]] into "a major independent label."<ref name="AM"/> [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]], writing for \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\', wrote that the group "defined the best of every music from the American South in that time. They were the best of all of us."<ref name="rs1"/> He went on to call the band "a true brotherhood of players \xe2\x80\x94 one that went beyond race and ego. It was a thing of beauty."<ref name="rs1"/> The band\'s extended popularity through heavy touring in the early 1990s created a new generation of fans, one that viewed the Allmans as pioneers of "latter-day collegiate jam rock."<ref name="rs"/>
[[AllMusic]] praised the band\'s history: "they went from being America\'s single most influential band to a shell of their former self trading on past glories, to reach the 21st century resurrected as one of the most respected rock acts of their era."<ref name="AM">{{cite web |author=Bruce Eder |title=The Allman Brothers Band - All Music Guide |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-allman-brothers-band-mn0000745964/biography |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref>
The [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]] episode "[[Simpson Safari]]" makes reference to the band and their improvisational live music style when Marge says that the tribal song they\'re dancing to has been going for hours and Homer replying that it\'s like the Allman Brothers.

In 2012, an official historic marker was erected on the site of the July 1970 [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1970)|Second Atlanta International Pop Festival]] near Byron, Georgia.  The Allman Brothers had played two sets at the festival, which was a significant event in their career.  The marker text reads, in part:  \xe2\x80\x9cOver thirty musical acts performed, including... Macon\xe2\x80\x99s Allman Brothers Band on their launching pad to national fame.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>Kulkosky, Victor. (2012-09-19).

In 2003, the band released a recording of their festival opening and closing performances, \'\'[[Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival: July 3 & 5, 1970\'\'. 2003.

\'\'\'The Band\'\'\' was a Canadian-American [[roots rock]] group that originally consisted of [[Rick Danko]] (bass guitar, double bass, fiddle, trombone, vocals), [[Levon Helm]] (drums, mandolin, guitar, vocals), [[Garth Hudson]] (keyboard instruments, saxophones, trumpet), [[Richard Manuel]] (piano, drums, baritone saxophone, vocals) and [[Robbie Robertson]] (guitar, vocals). The members of the Band first came together as they joined [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]\' backing group [[The Hawks (band)|The Hawks]] one by one between 1958 and 1963.

In 1964, they separated from Hawkins, after which they toured and released a few singles as \'\'\'Levon and the Hawks\'\'\' and the \'\'\'Canadian Squires\'\'\'. The next year, [[Bob Dylan]] hired them for his U.S. tour in 1965 and [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|world tour in 1966]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton |authorlink =Clinton Heylin| title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | location = New York | pages = 223\xe2\x80\x93260

Dylan continued to collaborate with the Band over the course of their career, including a joint [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]].

The original configuration of the Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in [[Martin Scorsese]]\'s 1978 documentary \'\'[[The Last Waltz]]\'\'. The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without [[guitar]]ist Robbie Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a [[Hollywood]] music producer. Following a 1986 show, Richard Manuel was found dead of suicide, but the remaining three members continued to tour and record albums with a revolving door of musicians filling Manuel\'s and Robertson\'s respective roles, before finally settling on [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]], [[Randy Ciarlante]], and [[Jim Weider]]. Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good. Levon Helm was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]] in 1998, and after a series of treatments was able to regain use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until he succumbed to the disease in 2012.

The group was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carasonline.ca/canadian-music-hall-of-fame/|title=Canadian Music Hall of Fame|publisher=carasonline.ca|accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band/|title=The Band|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref> In 2004, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' ranked them No.&nbsp;50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,<ref>{{cite web| last=Williams | first=Lucinda | authorlink=Lucinda Williams | title=The Immortals&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 The Greatest Artists of All Time: 50) The Band | work=Issue 946 | publisher=Rolling Stone | date=April 15, 2004 | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939240/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_50_the_band | accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> and in 2008, they received the [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]\'s Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Awards/Lifetime_Awards/ | title=Lifetime Achievement Award | publisher=Grammy.com | accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> In 2004, "[[The Weight]]" was ranked the 41st best song of all time in [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|\'\'Rolling Stone\'\'\'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|publisher=RollingStone.com|accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref>

==History==

===1960\xe2\x80\x931964: The Hawks===
The members of the Band gradually came together as a part of [[Toronto]]-based, [[rockabilly]] singer [[Ronnie Hawkins]]\' backing group, the Hawks: Helm, an original Hawk who journeyed with Hawkins from [[Arkansas]] to Ontario, then Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and finally, Hudson. Hawkins\' act was popular in and around Toronto, and he had an effective way of eliminating his musical competition: when a promising band appeared, Hawkins would often hire their best musicians for his own group;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Robertson, Danko, and Manuel came under Hawkins\' tutelage this way.

While most of the Hawks were eager to join Hawkins\' group, getting Hudson to join was a different story. He had earned a college degree, planned on a career as a music teacher, and was interested in playing rock music only as a hobby.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The Hawks were in awe of his wild, full-bore organ sound and often begged him to join.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Hudson finally relented, so long as the Hawks each paid him $10 per week to be their instructor; all music theory questions were directed to Hudson.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} While pocketing a little extra cash, Hudson was also able to mollify his family\'s fears that his education had gone to waste. The piano\xe2\x80\x93organ combination was uncommon in rock music, and for all his aggressive playing, Hudson also brought a level of musical sophistication.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

{{Blockquote|There is a view that [[jazz]] is \'evil\' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street, and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.|Garth Hudson|\'\'The Last Waltz\'\'}}

With Hawkins, they recorded a few singles in this period and became well known as the best rock group in the thriving Toronto music scene.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Hawkins regularly convened all-night rehearsals following long club shows, with the result that the young musicians quickly developed great technical prowess on their instruments.

In 1963, Levon Helm met the [[groupie]] [[Cathy Smith]], with whom he and other members of the Band would have a long association.<ref name=CESMITH2>{{cite web| title = Book: "This Wheel\'s on Fire".| url=http://theband.hiof.no/books/this_wheels_on_fire.html| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}</ref>

By 1964, the group had split from Hawkins over personal differences. They were tiring of playing the same songs so often and wanted to perform original material, and they were weary of Hawkins\'s somewhat dictatorial leadership.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} He would fine the Hawks if they brought their girlfriends to the clubs, fearing it might reduce the numbers of "available" girls who came to performances, or if they smoked marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Alcohol and pills were acceptable but Canada then had stiff penalties against marijuana possession.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Robertson later said, "Eventually, [Hawkins] built us up to the point where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, bless his heart, by sharpening us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/back_to_the_land.html |title=Andy Gill: Back to the Land |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |date= |accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

Upon leaving Hawkins in 1964, they were briefly known as the Levon Helm Sextet with sax player Jerry Penfound being the sixth member, then \'\'\'Levon and the Hawks\'\'\' after Penfound\'s departure. In 1965, they released a single on Ware Records under the name \'\'\'Canadian Squires\'\'\', but returned as Levon and the Hawks for a recording session for [[Atco Records|Atco]] later in 1965.<ref>Gray, 33 and 37</ref> Also that year, Helm and the band met blues singer and harmonica player [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]. They wanted to record with him, offering to become his backing band, but Williamson died not long after their meeting.

In late summer 1965, [[Bob Dylan]] was looking for a backup band for his first U.S. "electric" tour. Levon and the Hawks were recommended by blues singer [[John P. Hammond]], who earlier that year had used Helm, Hudson and Robertson on his [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] album \'\'So Many Roads\'\'.<ref>Heylin, 173\xe2\x80\x93174</ref><ref>Gray, 292\xe2\x80\x93293</ref> Around the same time, one of their friends from Toronto was working as secretary to Dylan\'s manager [[Albert Grossman]].

After hearing the band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson to join his backing band.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates, and told him that they would only continue with him if he hired all of the Hawks.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it could give them the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and [[rhythm and blues]] group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.<ref>Hoskyns, 94\xe2\x80\x9397</ref>

With Dylan, The Hawks played a series of concerts from September 1965 through May 1966, billed as \'\'\'Bob Dylan and the Band\'\'\'. The tours were marked by Dylan\'s reportedly copious use of [[amphetamine]]s. Some, though not all, of the Hawks joined in the excesses.<ref>Hoskyns, 104</ref> Most of the concerts were met with the heckling and disapproval of [[folk music]] purists. Helm was so affected by the negative reception that he left the tour within three months and sat out the rest of that year\'s concerts, as well as the world tour in 1966.<ref>Gray, 33</ref> Helm spent much of this period working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="helm">{{cite book |last1=Helm |first1=Levon |authorlink1=Levon Helm |last2=Davis |first2=Stephan |authorlink2=Stephan Davis |date=1993 |title=This Wheel\'s On Fire: Levon Helm And The Story Of The Band |url= http://books.google.ca/books?id=1TkFAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=this+wheel%27s+on+fire+oil+rig&source=bl&ots=WwFdGOIsiw&sig=LuJc9yuMPL2ei8XrniqocZNSp90&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1JcjVJbNOrSHsQSEjYK4Cg&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=this%20wheel\'s%20on%20fire%20oil%20rig&f=false |location= New York|publisher= William Morrow & Company |page= 143}}</ref>

During and between tours, Dylan and the Hawks attempted several recording sessions, but with less than satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable [[Single (music)|single]] ("[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window]]"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what was intended to be Dylan\'s next album, \'\'[[Blonde on Blonde]]\'\' resulted in "[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name="Heylin285-286">Heylin, Clinton. \'\'Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan, 1957\xe2\x80\x9373\'\', 2009, pp. 285\xe2\x80\x93286</ref> On "One Of Us Must Know", Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Danko (or [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]]),{{efn|The booklet accompanying the \'\'[[The Original Mono Recordings]]\'\' re-issue of \'\'Blonde on Blonde\'\' lists Will Lee as the bass player ([[Greil Marcus|Marcus, Greil]].

During the European leg of their [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 tour]], [[Mickey Jones]] replaced Sandy Konikoff on drums.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dylan and the Hawks played at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]] on May 17, 1966. The gig became legendary when, near the end of Dylan\'s electric set, an audience member shouted "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!". After a pause, Dylan replied, "I don\'t believe you. You\'re a liar!" He then turned to the Hawks and said "Play it fucking loud!"  With that, they launched into an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".<ref>Sounes, 213\xe2\x80\x93215</ref>

The Manchester performance was widely [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]ged (and mistakenly placed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]). The recording of this gig became one of the most famous of Dylan\'s career. A 1971 review from \'\'[[Creem]]\'\' stated "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock\'n\'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, my body to move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago.

On July 29, 1966, while on a break from touring, Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident, and retired into semi-seclusion in [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock]], [[New York]].<ref>Sounes, 216\xe2\x80\x93218</ref> For a while, the Hawks returned to the bar and roadhouse touring circuit, sometimes backing other singers (including a brief stint with [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Dylan invited the Hawks to join him in Woodstock in the summer of 1967, where (minus the still-absent Helm) they recorded a much-bootlegged and influential series of demos, some of which were subsequently released on LP as \'\'[[The Basement Tapes]]\'\'. A track-by-track review of the bootleg was detailed by [[Jann Wenner]] in \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\'; where the band members were explicitly named as well as giving a collective name of \'\'"The Crackers"\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dylans-basement-tape-should-be-released-19680622 |title=Dylan\'s Basement Tape Should Be Released |author=[[Jann Wenner]] |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1968-06-22 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref>

===1968\xe2\x80\x931972: initial success===
[[File:The Band 2005710031.jpg|thumb|220px|left|alt=|L to R:Danko, Helm and Manuel on tour in Hamburg, Germany in 1971]]
The sessions with Dylan ended in October 1967, with Helm having rejoined the group by that time. The Hawks then began writing their own songs in a rented large pink house, which they affectionately named "Big Pink", in [[West Saugerties, New York|West Saugerties]] (near Woodstock). When they went into the recording studio, they still did not have a name for themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Stories vary as to the manner in which they ultimately adopted the name "the Band." In \'\'The Last Waltz\'\', Manuel claimed that they wanted to call themselves either "The [[Honky|Honkies]]" or "The [[White cracker|Crackers]]" (which they used when backing Dylan for a January 1968 concert tribute to [[Woody Guthrie]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}), but these names were vetoed by their record label; Robertson suggests that during their time with Dylan everyone just referred to them as "the band" and it stuck. Initially, they disliked the moniker, but eventually grew to like it, thinking it both humble and presumptuous. In 1969, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' referred to them as "The band from Big Pink."<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news  | title = Big Pink Band To Tour U.S.  | newspaper = [[Rolling Stone]]  | page = 9  | date = April 5, 1969  | issue = 30}}</ref>

Their first album, \'\'[[Music from Big Pink]]\'\' (1968) was widely acclaimed. The album included three songs written or co-written by Dylan ("[[This Wheel\'s on Fire]]", "[[Tears of Rage]]", and "[[I Shall Be Released]]") as well as "[[The Weight]]", the use of which in the film \'\'[[Easy Rider]]\'\' would make it probably their best known song.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} While a continuity certainly ran through the music, there were stylistic leanings in a number of directions. In contrast to his wild guitar playing with Hawkins and Dylan, Robertson opted for a more subdued, riff-oriented approach, often mixed low down in the song.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:The Band -2005710053-.jpg|thumb|180px|right|alt=|Hudson in 1971.]]
After the success of \'\'Music from Big Pink\'\', the band went on tour. Their first live appearance was at Stony Brook University in the spring of 1969 several weeks preceding a performance at the [[Woodstock Festival]] (which was not included in the famed \'\'[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]\'\' film due to legal complications{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}) and an appearance with Dylan at the UK [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|Isle of Wight Festival]] (several songs from which were subsequently included on Dylan\'s \'\'[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]\'\' album). That same year, they left for [[Los Angeles]] to record their follow-up, \'\'[[The Band (album)|The Band]]\'\' (1969). From their deliberately rustic appearance on the cover, to the songs and arrangements within, the album stood in contrast to other popular music of the day.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Although it should be noted that, by this point, several acts, notably Dylan on \'\'[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]\'\' (written during \'\'The Basement Tapes\'\' sessions) and [[The Byrds]] on \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\' (featuring two \'\'Basement Tapes\'\' covers), had made similar stylistic moves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} \'\'The Band\'\' featured songs that evoked oldtime rural America, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]" to [[labor union|unionization]] of farm workers in "[[King Harvest (Has Surely Come)]]".

These first two records were produced by [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]], who was practically a group member: he aided in [[orchestration|arrangements]] and played occasional instruments (piano or [[tuba]]). Simon reported that he was often asked about the distinctive [[horn section]]s featured so effectively on the first two albums: people wanted to know how they had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

\'\'Rolling Stone\'\' lavished praise on the Band in this era, giving them more attention than perhaps any other group in the magazine\'s history;{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[Greil Marcus]]\' articles in particular contributed greatly to the Band\'s mystique. The Band was also featured on the cover of \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\'\'s January 12, 1970 issue.<ref>{{cite news | title=TIME Magazine Cover: The Band&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Jan. 12, 1970&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Rock&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Singers&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Music | url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19700112,00.html | publisher=Time.com | date=1970-01-12 | accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

A critical and commercial triumph, \'\'The Band\'\', along with works by [[The Byrds]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], established a musical template (sometimes dubbed [[country rock]]) that later would be taken to even greater levels of commercial success by such artists as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Both \'\'Big Pink\'\' and \'\'The Band\'\' also influenced their musical contemporaries, with both [[Eric Clapton]] and [[George Harrison]] citing the Band as a major influence on their musical direction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Indeed, Clapton later revealed that he had wanted to join the group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/eric_clapton/reviews/8542 | title=Eric Clapton&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Derek and The Dominos&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'\'Layla & Other Assorted...\'\'&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Review&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Uncut.co.uk | publisher=Uncut.co.uk | date= | accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

Following their second album, the Band embarked on their first tour as a headlining act.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The resulting anxiety from fame and its hang-ups was especially evidenced by the group as its songs turned to darker themes of fear and alienation: the influence on their next work is self-explanatory.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} \'\'[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]\'\' (1970) was engineered by musician/engineer/producer [[Todd Rundgren]] and recorded on a theatre stage in Woodstock, New York, but the fraying of the group\'s once-fabled unity was beginning to show. As was the case with their previous, self-titled record, Robertson is credited with the majority of the songwriting. However, the trademark vocal style of the Band\'s three lead singers was much less prominent on this work.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

After recording \'\'Stage Fright\'\', the Band was among the acts participating in the [[Festival Express]], an all-star rock concert tour of Canada by train that also included [[Janis Joplin]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and future Band member [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]] (at the time he was a member of Joplin\'s band).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the concert documentary film, released in 2003, Danko can be seen intoxicated participating in a drunken jam session with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]] and Joplin while singing "Ain\'t No More Cane".

At about this time, Robertson began exerting greater control over the Band, a point of antipathy, especially between Helm and Robertson.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Helm charges Robertson with [[authoritarianism]] and greed, while Robertson suggests his increased efforts in guiding the group were due largely to some of the other members being unreliable.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In particular, Robertson insists he did his best to coax Manuel into writing or co-writing more songs, only to see Manuel\'s talents overtaken by addiction.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Despite mounting problems between the musicians, the Band forged ahead with their next album, \'\'[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]\'\' (1971). \'\'Cahoots\'\' included tunes such as  [[Bob Dylan]]\'s "When I Paint My Masterpiece," "4% Pantomime" (with [[Van Morrison]]), and "Life Is a Carnival," the last featuring a horn arrangement from [[Allen Toussaint]]. Toussaint\'s contribution was a critical addition to the Band\'s next project, and the group would later record two songs written by Toussaint: "Holy Cow" (on \'\'[[Moondog Matinee]]\'\') and "You See Me" (on \'\'[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]).

In late December 1971, the Band recorded the live album \'\'[[Rock of Ages (album)|Rock of Ages]]\'\', which was released in the summer of 1972. On \'\'Rock of Ages\'\', they were bolstered by the addition of a [[horn section]], with arrangements written by Toussaint. Bob Dylan appeared on stage on [[New Year\'s Eve]] and performed four songs with the group, including a version of "When I Paint My Masterpiece".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===1973\xe2\x80\x9375: move to Shangri-La===
[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Bob Dylan and The Band touring in Chicago in 1974. Left to right: Danko, Robertson, Dylan and Helm.]]

In 1973, the Band released \'\'[[Moondog Matinee]]\'\', an album of cover songs. There was no tour in support of the album, which garnered mixed reviews.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However on July 28, 1973, they played at the legendary [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen]], a massive concert which took place at the Grand Prix Raceway outside of [[Watkins Glen, New York]]. The event, which was attended by over 600,000 music fans, also featured the Grateful Dead and [[The Allman Brothers Band]]. It was during this event that discussions began about a possible tour with Bob Dylan, who had &mdash;along with Robertson&mdash;moved to [[Malibu, California]]. By late 1973, Danko, Helm, Hudson and Manuel had joined them, and the first order of business was backing Dylan on the album \'\'[[Planet Waves]]\'\'. The album was released concurrently with their [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|joint 1974 tour]], in which they played 40 shows in North America during January and February 1974. Later that year, the live album \'\'[[Before the Flood]]\'\' was released, which documents the tour.

During this time, the Band had brought in \'\'Planet Waves\'\' producer [[Rob Fraboni]] to help design a music studio for the group to record in. By 1975, the studio&mdash;known as Shangri-La&mdash;was completed. That year, the Band recorded and released \'\'[[Northern Lights&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Southern Cross]]\'\', their first album of all-new material since 1971\'s \'\'[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]\'\'. All eight songs were written exclusively by Robertson. Despite poor record sales,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} the album is favored by critics and fans alike.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Levon Helm regards this album highly in his book, \'\'[[This Wheel\'s on Fire]]\'\': "It was the best album we had done since \'\'The Band\'\'."{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The album also produced more experimentation from Hudson switching to synthesizers, heavily showcased on "Jupiter Hollow".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===1976\xe2\x80\x9378: \'\'The Last Waltz\'\'===
[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|alt=|right|The Band with guests at The Last Waltz concert. Photo: [[David Gans (musician)|David Gans]]]]

By 1976, Robbie Robertson was weary of touring. After having to cancel tour dates due to Richard Manuel suffering a severe neck injury in a boating accident in Texas,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Robertson urged the Band to retire from touring, and conceived of a massive "farewell concert" known as \'\'[[The Last Waltz]]\'\'. The event was held, following an appearance on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' on October 30, on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] of 1976 at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]],<ref name = "Page 17">[[David Fricke|Fricke, David]], November 2001. \'\'The Last Waltz\'\' liner notes, 2002 CD re-issue, p. 17.</ref> and featured a [[horn section]] with arrangements by Allen Toussaint and a stellar list of guests, including other Canadian acts [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Neil Young]]. Two of the guests were fundamental to the Band\'s existence and growth:  [[Ronnie Hawkins]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. Other guests they admired (and in most cases had worked with before) included [[Muddy Waters]], [[Dr. John]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Bobby Charles]], [[Neil Diamond]], and [[Paul Butterfield]]. The concert was recorded by Robertson\'s friend, filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]].

In 1977, the Band released their seventh studio album \'\'[[Islands (The Band album)|Islands]]\'\', which fulfilled their record contract with Capitol so that a planned \'\'Last Waltz\'\' film and album could be released on the [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] label. \'\'Islands\'\' contained a mix of originals and covers, and was the last with the Band\'s original lineup. That same year, the group recorded soundstage performances with country singer [[Emmylou Harris]] ("Evangeline") and gospel-soul group [[The Staple Singers]] ("The Weight"); Scorsese combined these new performances\xe2\x80\x94as well as interviews he had conducted with the group\xe2\x80\x94with the 1976 concert footage. The resulting [[concert film]]\xe2\x80\x93[[documentary film|documentary]] was released in 1978, along with a triple-LP soundtrack.

Levon Helm later wrote about \'\'The Last Waltz\'\' in his autobiography \'\'This Wheel\'s on Fire\'\'; in the book he makes the case that \'\'The Last Waltz\'\' was primarily Robbie Robertson\'s project, and that he had forced the Band\'s break-up onto the rest of the group.<ref>Levon Helm and Stephen Davis. \'\'This Wheel\'s on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band\'\', Chapter Nine: \'\'The Last Waltz\'\'</ref> Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: "I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it\xe2\x80\x94and if this is only my statement, not theirs, I\'ll accept that. They\'re saying, \'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.\' Well, fine. I\'ll take the best music film that\'s ever been made, and make it my statement. I don\'t have any problems with that. None at all."<ref>Kiersh, Edward. \'\'Where Are You Now, Bo Diddley?

===1983\xe2\x80\x9389: reformation===
In 1983, the Band recommenced touring, though without Robertson.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Several musicians, mostly from the group\'s Ronnie Hawkins days, were recruited as touring personnel to replace Robertson and to fill out the group.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The reunited Band was generally well-received, but found themselves playing in smaller venues than during the peak of their popularity.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

After a performance in [[Florida]] on March 4, 1986, Richard Manuel committed [[suicide]], aged 42, in his motel room.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=RICHARD MANUEL, 40, ROCK SINGER AND PIANIST|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/obituaries/richard-manuel-40-rock-singer-and-pianist.html|accessdate=26 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 March 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|title=A Haunting Suicide Silences the Sweet, Soulful Voice of the Band\'s Richard Manuel|journal=People|date=24 March 1986|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20093224,00.html|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>  It was later revealed that he had suffered for many years from chronic alcoholism and drug addiction. According to Levon Helm\'s autobiography, in the later stages of his illness, Manuel was consuming eight bottles of [[Grand Marnier]] per day.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Manuel\'s position as pianist was filled by old friend [[Stan Szelest]] (who died not long after), then by [[Richard Bell (Canadian musician)|Richard Bell]]. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after the departure of the original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin\'s [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].

The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] at the [[Juno Awards of 1989|1989 Juno Awards]],{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} where Robertson was reunited with original members Danko and Hudson. With Canadian country rock superstars [[Blue Rodeo]] as a back-up band, [[Music Express]] called the 1989 Juno appearance a symbolic "passing of the torch" from The Band to [[Blue Rodeo]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===1990\xe2\x80\x9399: return to recording===
The Band appeared at [[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration|Bob Dylan\'s 30th anniversary concert]] celebration in New York City in October 1992, where they performed their version of Dylan\'s "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]". In 1993, the group released their eighth studio album, \'\'[[Jericho (album)|Jericho]]\'\'. Without Robbie Robertson as primary lyricist, much of the [[songwriting]] for the album came from outside of the group. Also that year, the Band, along with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and other performers, appeared at US President [[Bill Clinton]]\'s 1993 "Blue Jean Bash" inauguration party.<ref>Gray, Michael. \'\'The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia\'\' (Levon Helm entry), ISBN 0826429742</ref>

In 1994, the Band performed at [[Woodstock \'94]]. Later that year Robertson appeared with Danko and Hudson as the Band for the second time since the original group broke up. The occasion was the induction of the Band into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Helm, who had been at odds with Robertson for years over accusations of stolen songwriting credits, did not attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-band |title=Induction into Rock HoF |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> In February 1996, the Band with [[The Crickets]] recorded "[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]", released on the [[tribute album]] \'\'\'[[Not Fade Away (Remembering Buddy Holly)]]\'\'. the Band released two more albums after \'\'Jericho\'\': \'\'[[High on the Hog (The Band album)|High on the Hog]]\'\' (1996) and \'\'[[Jubilation (The Band album)|Jubilation]]\'\' (1998), the latter of which included guest appearances by [[Eric Clapton]] and [[John Hiatt]].

The final song the group recorded together was their 1999 cover of Bob Dylan\'s "[[One Too Many Mornings]]", which they contributed to the Dylan tribute album \'\'[[Tangled Up in Blues]]\'\'. On December 10, 1999, Rick Danko died in his sleep at the age of 56. Following his death, the Band broke up for good.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In 2002, Robertson bought all other former members\' financial interests in the group, with the exception of Helm,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/04/04/DD64672.DTL&type=music&ao=2 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joel | last=Selvin | title=The day the music lived / Rereleased \'Last Waltz\' documents amazing night in 1976 when rock\'s royalty bid farewell to the Band&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Page 2 of 2 | date=2011-01-08}}</ref> giving him major control of the presentation of the group\'s material, including latter-day compilations.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Richard Bell died of [[multiple myeloma]] in June 2007.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The Band received a Lifetime Achievement [[Grammy Award]] on February 9, 2008,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but there was no reunion of all three living members.

===Members\' other endeavors===
In 1977, Rick Danko released his [[eponym]]ous [[Rick Danko (album)|debut solo album]], which featured the other four members of the Band on various tracks. In 1984, Danko joined members of the [[Byrds]], the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]], and others in the huge touring company that made up "The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration". Several members of the band performed solo songs to start the show including Danko who performed "Mystery Train". Danko also released a number of additional solo albums in the 1990s, "In Concert", "Live On Breeze Hill" & "Times Like These".

In the late 70s and 80s, Helm released several solo albums and toured with a band called Levon Helm and the RCO Allstars. He also began an acting career with his role as [[Loretta Lynn]]\'s father in \'\'[[Coal Miner\'s Daughter (film)|Coal Miner\'s Daughter]]\'\'. He also received praise for his narration and supporting role opposite [[Sam Shepard]] in 1983\'s \'\'[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]\'\'. Beginning sometime in the 1990s, Helm regularly performed [[Levon Helm#The Midnight Ramble|Midnight Ramble]] concerts at his home and studio in [[Woodstock, New York]], and toured.<ref>{{cite web | author = Dawn LoBue | year = 2006 | url =http://levonhelm.com/biography.htm | title =  Levon Helm Biography | publisher  = LevonHelm.com | accessdate = December 12, 2011}}</ref> In 2007 Helm released a new album, an homage to his southern roots called \'\'[[Dirt Farmer]]\'\', which was awarded a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] on February 9, 2008. \'\'[[Electric Dirt]]\'\' followed in 2009 and won the inaugural [[Grammy Award for Best Americana Album]]. His 2011 live album \'\'[[Ramble at the Ryman]]\'\' was nominated in the same category and won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees?year=2011&genre=59|title=Best Americana Album|publisher=Grammy.com|accessdate=December 9, 2011}}</ref>

After he left the Band, Robbie Robertson became a [[music producer]] and wrote film soundtracks (including acting as music supervisor for several of Scorsese\'s films) before beginning a solo career with his [[Daniel Lanois]]-produced [[Robbie Robertson (album)|eponymous album]] in 1987.

Hudson has released two acclaimed solo CDs, \'\'The Sea To The North\'\' in 2001, produced by Aaron (Professor Louie) Hurwitz and \'\'LIVE at the WOLF\'\' in 2005, both featuring his wife Maud on vocals. He has also kept busy as an in-demand studio musician. He is featured extensively on recordings of [[The Call (band)|The Call]] and Country/Indie star Neko Case. Hudson contributed an original electronic score to an [[Off-Broadway]] production of \'\'Dragon Slayers\'\', written by [[Stanley Keyes]] and directed by [[Brad Mays]] in 1986 at the [[Union Square Theatre]] in New York, which was re-staged with a new cast in Los Angeles in 1990. In 2010, Hudson released \'\'Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of The Band\'\' featuring Canadian artists covering songs that were recorded by the Band.

Manuel had few projects outside of the Band; he and the rest of the Band contributed to [[Eric Clapton]]\'s 1976 album \'\'[[No Reason to Cry]]\'\'. It included an original composition by Manuel, and also featured his vocals and drumming on several tracks. Manuel later worked on several film scores with Hudson and Robertson, including \'\'[[Raging Bull]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Color of Money]]\'\'.

==Musical style==
[[File:The Band - 2005710051.jpg|thumb|right|The Band in Hamburg, 1971. Left to right: Manuel, Danko, Robertson, and Helm.]]
The Band\'s music fused many elements: primarily old [[country music]] and early [[rock and roll]], though the [[rhythm section]] often was reminiscent of [[Stax Records|Stax]] or [[Motown]]-style [[rhythm and blues]], and Robertson cites [[Curtis Mayfield]] and the [[Staple Singers]] as major influences, resulting in a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of many [[musical genre]]s. As to the group\'s songwriting, very few of their early compositions were based on conventional [[blues]] and [[doo-wop]] [[chord progression|chord change]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Singers Manuel, Danko, and Helm each brought a distinctive voice to the Band: Helm\'s [[Southern American English|Southern]] voice had more than a hint of country, Danko sang in a tenor, and Manuel alternated between falsetto and baritone. The singers regularly blended in [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]]. Though the singing was more or less evenly shared among the three men, both Danko and Helm have stated that they saw Manuel as the Band\'s "lead" singer.<ref>\'\'Classic albums: The Band\'\' documentary, 1997</ref>

Every member, with the exception of Robertson, was a multi-instrumentalist. There was little instrument-switching when they played live, but when recording, the musicians could make up different configurations in service of the songs. Hudson in particular was able to coax a wide range of [[timbre]]s from his [[Lowrey organ]]; on the choruses of "[[Tears of Rage]]", for example, it sounds like a [[mellotron]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Helm\'s drumming was often praised: critic Jon Carroll declared that Helm was "the only drummer who can make you cry,"{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} while prolific session drummer [[Jim Keltner]] admits to appropriating several of Helm\'s techniques.<ref>Hoskyns, 189</ref> Producer [[John Simon (record producer)|John Simon]] is often cited as a "sixth member" of the Band for producing and playing on \'\'[[Music from Big Pink]]\'\', co-producing and playing on \'\'[[The Band (album)|The Band]]\'\', and playing on other songs up through the Band\'s 1993 reunion album \'\'[[Jericho (album)|Jericho]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fEA7MuMoLqcC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=john+simon+sixth+member+of+the+band&source=bl&ots=3VXZ14r89e&sig=POwIWC_ghHeqcLMJmvPK6bA73Io&hl=en&ei=oXeRStv5NYSasgO9_6UM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Barney Hoskyns&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'&#39;Across the Great Divide: The Band and America\'&#39; |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

==Copyright controversy==
Robertson is credited as writer or co-writer for the majority of the Band\'s songs, but sang lead vocals on only three of their studio recordings ("To Kingdom Come", "Knockin\' Lost John", and "Out of the Blue"). This role, along with Robertson\'s resulting claim to the copyright of most of the compositions, would become a point of contention, especially as directed towards Robertson by Helm. In his 1993 autobiography \'\'[[This Wheel\'s on Fire&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Levon Helm and the Story of The Band]]\'\', Helm disputes the validity of the official songwriting credits as listed on the albums, and explains that the Band\'s songs were often honed and recorded through collaboration between all members. Danko concurred with Helm: "I think Levon\'s book hits the nail on the head about where Robbie and [[Albert Grossman]] and some of those people went wrong and when the Band stopped being the Band." ... "I\'m truly friends with everybody but, hey\xe2\x80\x94it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble."<ref>Flanagan, Bill.

The Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters, and performers, from the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[The Beatles]]{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} to [[Eric Clapton]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]],<ref>Gray, 36\xe2\x80\x9337</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]],<ref>[[Mick Wall]] (2008), \'\'When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography Of Led Zeppelin\'\', London: Orion, p. 181</ref> [[Elvis Costello]],<ref>Hoskyns, 169</ref> [[Elton John]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seaggs |first1=Austin |title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Elton John |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=1124 |pages=36\xe2\x80\x9368 |date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> [[Phish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/10-goodbyes-to-levon-helm/ |title=10 Goodbyes To Levon Helm |publisher=American Songwriter |date= |accessdate=2013-02-19}}</ref> and [[Pink Floyd]]<ref>http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/06/26/today-in-music-history-the-band-release-music-from-big-pink</ref>

The album \'\'[[Music from Big Pink]]\'\', in particular, is credited with contributing to Clapton\'s decision to leave the [[Supergroup (music)|super group]] [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. In his introduction of the Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 he\'d heard the album, "and it changed my life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/levons_next_waltz_rs.html |title=Scott Spencer: Levon\'s Next Waltz |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> Guitarist [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] has openly acknowledged the album\'s influence on [[Fairport Convention]]\'s \'\'[[Liege and Lief]]\'\', and journalist John Harris has suggested that the Band\'s debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles\' back-to-basics album \'\'[[Let It Be]]\'\' as well as The Rolling Stones\' string of roots-infused albums that began with \'\'[[Beggars Banquet]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite news | last = Harris | first = John | title = There was a manic feeling in the air | publisher = The Guardian | date = 2007-08-03 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/aug/03/folk | accessdate = 2008-12-28 | location=London}}</ref>{{efn|The recording sessions for \'\'Beggars Banquet\'\', however, wrapped up the same month that \'\'Music From Big Pink\'\' was released.}} [[George Harrison]] has said that his song "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]" was heavily influenced by the Band, and that while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80788/george-harrison-all-things-in-good-time|title=George Harrison: \'All Things\' In Good Time|accessdate=2013-07-16|work=Billboard.com}}</ref> Meanwhile, the \'\'Big Pink\'\' song "[[The Weight]]" has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group\'s influence, "We certainly didn\'t want everybody to go out and get a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we\'re going to do now is go to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and record four sides, four [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll."<ref>Gladstone, Howard.

In the nineties, a new generation of bands influenced by the Band began to gain popularity, including [[Counting Crows]], the [[The Wallflowers|Wallflowers]], and [[The Black Crowes]]. Counting Crows indicated this influence with their tribute to the late [[Richard Manuel]], "[[If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead)]]" from their album \'\'[[Hard Candy (Counting Crows album)|Hard Candy]]\'\'. The [[Black Crowes]] frequently cover Band songs during live performances, such as "The Night They Drove Ol\' Dixie Down", which appears on their DVD/CD \'\'[[Freak \'n\' Roll into the Fog]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496245/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for The Black Crowes: Freak \'N\' Roll... Into the Fog |accessdate=2009-12-06 |work=The Internet Movie Database }}</ref> They have also recorded at Helm\'s studio in Woodstock.

The inspiration for the classic rock-influenced band [[The Hold Steady]] came while members Craig Finn and Tad Kubler were watching \'\'[[The Last Waltz]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dailycollegian.com/2007/01/24/hold-steady-returns-hope-to-rocknroll/ | last=Master | first=Dave | title=Hold Steady returns hope to rock\'n\'roll: Daily Collegian exclusive interview with Craig Finn | publisher=The Daily Collegian}}</ref> Rick Danko and Robbie Robertson are namechecked in the lyrics of "The Swish" from The Hold Steady\'s 2004 debut album \'\'[[Almost Killed Me]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cloakanddaggermedia.com/features/craig_finn/features2.html | title=Feature: Craig Finn | publisher=Cloak & Dagger Media}}</ref> Also that year, [[southern rock]]-revivalists [[Drive-By Truckers]] released the track "Danko/Manuel" on the album \'\'[[The Dirty South (album)|The Dirty South]]\'\'.

The Band also inspired Grace Potter, of [[Grace Potter and the Nocturnals]], to form the band in 2002. In an interview with The Montreal Gazette, Potter said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Band blew my mind.

Members of [[Wilco]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]], [[The Shins]], [[Dr Dog]], [[Yellowbirds]], [[Ween]], [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]], and other bands staged [[The Complete Last Waltz]] in 2012 and 2013.<ref name="thefutureheart.com">{{cite web|author= |url=http://thefutureheart.com/2013/11/16/last-waltz/ |title=Members of Yellowbirds, Wilco, Dr Dog, Ween, CYHSY, Fruit Bats, Blitzen Trapper, Low Anthem, Superhuman Happiness, more to Perform the Band\xe2\x80\x99s Entire "Last Waltz" |publisher=The Future Heart |date=2013-11-16 |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref> Their performances included all 41 songs from the original 1976 concert in sequence, even those edited out of the film.

\'\'\'Bob Dylan\'\'\' ({{IPAc-en|\xcb\x88|d|\xc9\xaa|l|\xc9\x99n}}; born \'\'\'Robert Allen Zimmerman\'\'\', May 24, 1941) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as "[[Blowin\' in the Wind]]" and "[[The Times They Are a-Changin\' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin\']]" became anthems for the American [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954\xe2\x80\x9368)|civil rights]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] movements. Leaving his initial base in the [[American folk music revival]], Dylan\'s six-minute single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid-1960s recordings, backed by [[rock music]]ians, reached the top end of the [[Billboard charts|United States music charts]] while also attracting [[Electric Dylan controversy|denunciation and criticism]] from others in the folk movement.

Dylan\'s lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]. Initially inspired by the performances of [[Little Richard]], and the songwriting of [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Hank Williams]], Dylan has amplified and personalized musical [[Music genre|genres]]. His recording career, spanning 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song\xe2\x80\x94from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[Country music|country]] to [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rock and roll]], and [[rockabilly]] to [[Folk music of England|English]], [[Scottish folk music|Scottish]], and [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]], embracing even [[jazz]] and the [[Great American Songbook]]. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the [[Never Ending Tour]]. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is considered his songwriting.

Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists of all time]]; he has received [[List of awards received by Bob Dylan|numerous awards]] including [[Grammy]], [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award]]; he has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Minnesota Music Hall of Fame]], [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. The [[Pulitzer Prize]] jury in 2008 awarded him a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special citation]] for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power." In May 2012, Dylan received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Barack Obama]].

===Origins and musical beginnings===
Bob Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman ([[Hebrew]] name \xd7\xa9\xd7\x91\xd7\xaa\xd7\x90\xd7\x99 \xd7\x96\xd7\x99\xd7\xa1\xd7\x9c \xd7\x91\xd7\x9f \xd7\x90\xd7\x91\xd7\xa8\xd7\x94\xd7\x9d [Shabtai Zisl ben Avraham])<ref>Sounes, p. 14, gives his Hebrew name as Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham</ref><ref>A [[Chabad]] news service gives the variant Zushe ben Avraham, which may be a [[Yiddish]] variant {{cite web | url = http://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/573406/jewish/SingerSongwriter-Bob-Dylan-Joins-Yom-Kippur-Services-in-Atlanta.htm | title = Singer/Songwriter Bob Dylan Joins Yom Kippur Services in Atlanta | date = September 24, 2007 | accessdate =September 11, 2008 | publisher=Chabad.org News }}</ref> in St Mary\'s Hospital on May 24, 1941, the first of two boys, in [[Duluth, Minnesota]],<ref>Sounes, p. 14</ref><ref name=mnbirth>{{cite web|url=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?ti=0&indiv=try&db=mnbirth&h=9920599|title=Robert Allen Zimmerman|work=Minnesota Birth Index, 1935\xe2\x80\x932002|publisher=Ancestry.com|quote=Name: Robert Allen Zimmerman; Birth Date: 24 May 1941; Birth County: Saint Louis; Father: Abram H. Zimmerman; Mother: Beatrice Stone|accessdate=September 6, 2011}}{{subscription required}}</ref> and raised in [[Hibbing, Minnesota]], on the [[Mesabi Range]] west of [[Lake Superior]]. Dylan\'s paternal grandparents, Zigman and Anna Zimmerman, emigrated from [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] now [[Ukraine]], to the United States following anti-Semitic [[Odessa pogroms#1905 Pogrom|pogroms of 1905]].<ref name = "Sounes-p12">Sounes, pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9313.</ref> His maternal grandparents, Ben and Florence Stone, were [[Lithuanian Jews]] who arrived in the United States in 1902.<ref name = "Sounes-p12"/> In his autobiography \'\'[[Chronicles: Volume One]]\'\', Dylan writes that his paternal grandmother\'s maiden name was Kirghiz and her family originated from [[Ka\xc4\x9f\xc4\xb1zman]] district of [[Kars Province]] in north-eastern Turkey.<ref>Dylan, pp. 92\xe2\x80\x9393.</ref>

Dylan\'s parents, Abram Zimmerman and Beatrice "Beatty" Stone, were part of the area\'s small but close-knit Jewish community. Robert Zimmerman lived in Duluth until age six, when his father had polio and the family returned to his mother\'s home town, Hibbing, where Zimmerman spent the rest of his childhood. Robert Zimmerman spent his early years listening to the radio\xe2\x80\x94first to [[blues]] and [[country music|country stations]] from [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and, as a teen, to rock and roll.<ref name = "Shelton-38">Shelton, pp. 38\xe2\x80\x9340.</ref> Zimmerman formed several bands while attending [[Hibbing High School]].

Zimmerman moved to [[Minneapolis]] in September 1959 and enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]]. His focus on rock and roll gave way to American folk. In 1985, he said:

{{quotation|The thing about rock\'n\'roll is that for me anyway it wasn\'t enough&nbsp;... There were great catch-phrases and driving pulse rhythms&nbsp;... but the songs weren\'t serious or didn\'t reflect life in a realistic way. I knew that when I got into folk music, it was more of a serious type of thing. The songs are filled with more despair, more sadness, more triumph, more faith in the supernatural, much deeper feelings.<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>}}

He began to perform at the Ten&nbsp;O\'Clock Scholar, a coffeehouse a few blocks from campus, and became involved in the [[Dinkytown]] [[folk music]] circuit.<ref>Shelton, pp. 65\xe2\x80\x9382.</ref><ref name = "No Direction Home">This is related in the documentary film \'\'[[No Direction Home]]\'\', Director: [[Martin Scorsese]]. Broadcast: September 26, 2005, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] & [[BBC Two]]</ref>

During his Dinkytown days, Zimmerman began introducing himself as "Bob Dylan".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 7.</ref><ref group=a>According to Dylan\'s biographer, [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], the singer first confided his change of name to his high school girlfriend Echo Helstrom in 1958, telling her that he had found a "great name, Bob Dillon". Shelton surmises that Dillon had two sources: [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western \'\'[[Gunsmoke]]\'\'; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing\'s principal families. While Shelton was writing Dylan\'s biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him: "Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas\'s poetry is for people that aren\'t really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance." At the University of Minnesota, the singer told a few friends that Dillon was his mother\'s maiden name, which was untrue. The singer later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton adds that only when he reached New York in 1961 did the singer begin to spell his name \'Dylan\', by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\xe2\x80\x9345.</ref> In his memoir, Dylan acknowledged that he had been influenced by the poetry of [[Dylan Thomas]].<ref>Dylan, pp. 78\xe2\x80\x9379.</ref> Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked: "You\'re born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself. This is the land of the free."<ref name = "60minutes2005"/>

===1960s===

====Relocation to New York and record deal====
In May 1960, Dylan dropped out of college at the end of his first year. In January 1961, he traveled to New York City, to perform there and visit his musical idol, [[Woody Guthrie]],<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> who was seriously ill with [[Huntington\'s disease]] in [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances. Describing Guthrie\'s impact, he wrote: "The songs themselves had the infinite sweep of humanity in them&nbsp;... [He] was the true voice of the American spirit. I said to myself I was going to be Guthrie\'s greatest disciple."<ref>Dylan, pp. 244\xe2\x80\x93246.</ref> As well as visiting Guthrie in hospital, Dylan befriended Guthrie\'s acolyte, [[Ramblin\' Jack Elliott]]. Much of Guthrie\'s repertoire was channeled through Elliott, and Dylan paid tribute to Elliott in \'\'[[Chronicles: Volume One]]\'\'.<ref>Dylan, pp. 250\xe2\x80\x93252.</ref>

From February 1961, Dylan played at clubs around [[Greenwich Village]]. He befriended and picked up material from folk singers there, including [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Odetta]], the [[New Lost City Ramblers]], and Irish musicians [[The Clancy Brothers|the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]].<ref>Shelton (2011), pp. 74\xe2\x80\x9378.</ref> In September, Dylan gained public recognition when [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] wrote a review in \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\' of a show at [[Gerde\'s Folk City]].<ref>Shelton, Robert (September 21, 1961). \'\'The New York Times\'\', "Bob Dylan: A Distinctive Stylist" reproduced online: {{cite web

|description="[[Blowin\' in the Wind]]" was, according to critic Andy Gill, "the song with which Dylan\'s name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a [[civil libertarian]] through any number of changes in style and attitude".<ref>Gill, p. 23.</ref>

Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan,<ref>Sounes, p. 121.</ref> and he signed a management contract with [[Albert Grossman]].<ref>Sounes, p. 116.</ref> (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.)<ref>Sounes, pp.&nbsp;94\xe2\x80\x9395, 115. An interview with Silver on DVD, filmed for the documentary \'\'[[No Direction Home]]\'\' but not used, was included with the album \'\'[[Together Through Life]]\'\'.</ref> Grossman remained Dylan\'s manager until 1970, and was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 283\xe2\x80\x93284.</ref> Dylan said, "He was kind of like a [[Colonel Tom Parker]] figure&nbsp;... you could smell him coming."<ref name = "No Direction Home" /> Tensions between Grossman and [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] led to Hammond\'s being replaced as producer of Dylan\'s second album by the young African-American jazz producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 115\xe2\x80\x93116.</ref>

Dylan made his first trip to the United Kingdom from December 1962 to January 1963.<ref name = "Heylin-p35">Heylin (1996), pp. 35\xe2\x80\x9339.</ref> He had been invited by TV director [[Philip Saville]] to appear in a drama, \'\'[[Madhouse on Castle Street]]\'\', which Saville was directing for [[BBC Television]].<ref name = "Flash-back">{{cite news|last=Llewellyn-Smith|first=Caspar|title=Flash-back|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/sep/18/popandrock.bobdylan|accessdate=June 17, 2012|newspaper=The Observer|date=September 18, 2005|location=London}}</ref> At the end of the play, Dylan performed "Blowin\' in the Wind", one of its first public performances.<ref name = "Flash-back"/> The film recording of \'\'Madhouse on Castle Street\'\' was [[wiping|destroyed]] by the BBC in 1968.<ref name = "Flash-back"/> While in London, Dylan performed at London folk clubs, including [[The Troubadour, London|the Troubadour]], [[Les Cousins (music club)|Les Cousins]], and [[Bunjies]].<ref name = "Heylin-p35"/> He also learned material from UK performers, including [[Martin Carthy]].<ref name = "Flash-back"/>

By the time of Dylan\'s second album, \'\'[[The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan]]\'\', in May 1963, he had begun to make his name as a singer and a songwriter. Many songs on this album were labeled [[protest song]]s, inspired partly by Guthrie and influenced by [[Pete Seeger]]\'s passion for topical songs.<ref>Shelton, pp. 138\xe2\x80\x93142.</ref> "Oxford Town", for example, was an account of [[James Meredith]]\'s ordeal as the first black student to risk enrollment at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>Shelton, p. 156.</ref>

His most famous song at this time, "[[Blowin\' in the Wind]]", partly derived its melody from the traditional [[slave]] song, "No More Auction Block". Its lyrics questioned the social and political status quo.<ref>The booklet by [[John Bauldie]] accompanying Dylan\'s \'\'[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\xe2\x80\x933 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\xe2\x80\x931991]]\'\' (1991) says: "Dylan acknowledged the debt in 1978 to journalist Marc Rowland: \'\'Blowin\' In The Wind\' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called \'No More Auction Block\'\xe2\x80\x94that\'s a spiritual and \'Blowin\' In The Wind follows the same feeling.{{\' "}} pp. 6\xe2\x80\x938.</ref> The song was widely recorded and became a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]. Many other artists had hits with Dylan\'s songs. "[[A Hard Rain\'s a-Gonna Fall]]" was based on the folk ballad "[[Lord Randall]]". With veiled references to an impending apocalypse, the song gained more resonance when the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed a few weeks after Dylan began performing it.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 101\xe2\x80\x93103.</ref><ref group=a>In a May 1963 interview with [[Studs Terkel]], Dylan broadened the meaning of the song, saying "the pellets of poison flooding the waters" refers to "the lies people are told on their radios and in their newspapers". Cott (2006), p. 8.</ref> Like "Blowin\' in the Wind", "A Hard Rain\'s a-Gonna Fall" marked a new direction in songwriting, blending a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]], [[imagism|imagist]] lyrical attack with traditional folk form.<ref>Ricks, pp. 329\xe2\x80\x93344.</ref>

Dylan\'s topical songs enhanced his early reputation, and he came to be seen as more than just a songwriter. [[Janet Maslin]] wrote of \'\'Freewheelin{{\'}}\'\': "These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation\xe2\x80\x94someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing movement for [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955\xe2\x80\x931968)|civil rights]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes."<ref>Maslin in Miller (ed.) Miller, (1981), \'\'The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll\'\', 1981, p. 220</ref><ref group=a>The title "Spokesman of a Generation" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, \'\'[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]\'\', Dylan wrote: "The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn\'t beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline "Spokesman Denies That He\'s A Spokesman". I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs." Dylan (2004), p.119</ref> \'\'Freewheelin{{\'}}\'\' also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan\'s persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [[The Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said, "We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\xe2\x80\x94it was incredibly original and wonderful."<ref>\'\'Mojo\'\' magazine, December 1993. p. 97</ref>

The rough edge of Dylan\'s singing was unsettling to some but an attraction to others. [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: "When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying."<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan\'s advocate as well as his lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136\xe2\x80\x93138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28\xe2\x80\x9331.</ref>

Others who had hits with Dylan\'s songs in the early 1960s included [[the Byrds]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Hollies]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[the Association]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Turtles]]. Most attempted a pop feel and rhythm, while Dylan and Baez performed them mostly as sparse folk songs. The covers became so ubiquitous that [[CBS]] promoted him with the slogan "Nobody Sings Dylan Like Dylan."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/bob-dylans-songs-offer-rich-pickings-for-other-singers/2007/08/14/1186857512999.html | title = It ain\'t me babe but I like how it sounds | date = August 15, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | last = Meacham | first = Steve |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]", recorded during the \'\'Freewheelin\'\'\' sessions with a backing band, was released as a single and then quickly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]."<ref>[[Biograph (album)|\'\'Biograph\'\']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]]. Musicians on "Mixed Up Confusion": George Barnes & [[Bruce Langhorne]] (guitars); [[Dick Wellstood]] (piano); [[Gene Ramey]] (bass); [[Herb Lovelle]] (drums)</ref>

====Protest and \'\'Another Side\'\'====
In May 1963, Dylan\'s political profile rose when he walked out of \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\'. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by [[CBS]] television\'s head of program practices that "[[Talkin\' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]" was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]]. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear.<ref>Dylan had recorded "Talkin\' John Birch Society Blues" for his [[The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan|\'\'Freewheelin\'\']] album, but the song was replaced by later compositions, including "[[Masters of War]]". See Heylin (2000), pp. 114\xe2\x80\x93115.</ref>

 |title = "The Times They Are a-Changin\'"
 |description= Dylan said of "The Times They Are a-Changin\'": "This was definitely a song with a purpose. I wanted to write a big song, some kind of theme song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close and allied together at that time."<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>
 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

By this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954\xe2\x80\x9368)|civil rights movement]], singing together at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] on August 28, 1963.<ref>Dylan performed "[[Only a Pawn in Their Game]]" and "[[When the Ship Comes In]]"; see Heylin (1996), p. 49.</ref> Dylan\'s third album, \'\'[[The Times They Are a-Changin\' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin\']]\'\', reflected a more politicized and cynical Dylan.<ref>Gill, pp. 37\xe2\x80\x9341.</ref> The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with "Only A Pawn In Their Game" addressing the murder of civil rights worker [[Medgar Evers]]; and the [[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" the death of black hotel barmaid Hattie Carroll, at the hands of young white socialite William Zantzinger.<ref>Ricks, pp. 221\xe2\x80\x93233.</ref> On a more general theme, "[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]" and "[[North Country Blues]]" addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, "Boots of Spanish Leather" and "One Too Many Mornings".<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref>

By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements.<ref>Shelton, pp. 200\xe2\x80\x93205.</ref> Accepting the "[[Thomas Paine|Tom Paine]] Award" from the [[National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] shortly after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and balding, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy\'s assassin, [[Lee Harvey Oswald]].<ref>Part of Dylan\'s speech went: "There\'s no black and white, left and right to me any more; there\'s only up and down and down is very close to the ground. And I\'m trying to go up without thinking of anything trivial such as politics."; see, Shelton, pp. 200\xe2\x80\x93205.</ref>
[[File:Bob Dylan in November 1963-5.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A spotlight shines on Dylan as he performs onstage.|\'\'Bobby\'\' Dylan, as the college yearbook lists him: [[St. Lawrence University]], upstate New York, November 1963]]

\'\'[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]\'\', recorded on a single evening in June 1964,<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 60.</ref> had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan reemerged on "I Shall Be Free No.&nbsp;10" and "Motorpsycho Nightmare". "[[Spanish Harlem Incident]]" and "[[To Ramona]]" are passionate love songs, while "[[Black Crow Blues]]" and "[[I Don\'t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)]]" suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan\'s music. "[[It Ain\'t Me Babe]]", on the surface a song about spurned love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him.<ref>Shelton, p. 222.</ref> His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs: the [[impressionism|impressionistic]] "[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]", which sets [[social commentary]] against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as "chains of flashing images,"<ref>In an interview with Seth Goddard for \'\'Life\'\' (July 5, 2001) Ginsberg said Dylan\'s technique had been inspired by [[Jack Kerouac]]: "(Dylan) pulled \'\'[[Mexico City Blues]]\'\' from my hand and started reading it and I said, \'What do you know about that?\' He said, \'Somebody handed it to me in \'59 in St. Paul and it blew my mind.\' So I said \'Why?\' He said, \'It was the first poetry that spoke to me in my own language.\' So those chains of flashing images you get in Dylan, like \'the motorcycle black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom lover,\' they\'re influenced by Kerouac\'s chains of flashing images and spontaneous writing, and that spreads out into the people."

In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to [[folk-rock]] pop-music star. His jeans and work shirts were replaced by a [[Carnaby Street]] wardrobe, sunglasses day or night, and pointed "[[Beatle boot]]s". A London reporter wrote: "Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of [[Leicester Square]]. He looks like an undernourished [[cockatoo]]."<ref>Shelton, pp. 267\xe2\x80\x93271; pp. 288\xe2\x80\x93291.</ref> Dylan began to spar with interviewers.

====Going electric====
{{Main|Electric Dylan controversy}}
[[File:The Byrds Bob Dylan Ciro\'s.jpg|300px|thumb|Bob Dylan making an impromptu guest appearance with [[the Byrds]] at [[Ciro\'s]] nightclub, March 26, 1965]]
Dylan\'s late March 1965 album \'\'[[Bringing It All Back Home]]\'\' was another leap,<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 181\xe2\x80\x93182.</ref> featuring his first recordings with electric instruments. The first single, "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", owed much to [[Chuck Berry]]\'s "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]";<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 220\xe2\x80\x93222.</ref> its free association lyrics described as harkening back to the energy of [[beat poetry]] and as a forerunner of [[rapping|rap]] and [[hip-hop]].<ref>Marqusee, p. 144.</ref> The song was provided with an early video, which opened [[D. A. Pennebaker]]\'s [[cin\xc3\xa9ma v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9]] presentation of Dylan\'s 1965 tour of Great Britain, \'\'[[Dont Look Back]]\'\'.<ref>Gill, pp. 68\xe2\x80\x9369.</ref> Instead of miming, Dylan illustrated the lyrics by throwing cue cards containing key words from the song on the ground. Pennebaker said the sequence was Dylan\'s idea, and it has been imitated in music videos and advertisements.<ref>Lee, p. 18.</ref>

The second side of \'\'Bringing It All Back Home\'\' contained four long songs on which Dylan accompanied himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica.<ref name = "Sounes-168">Sounes, pp. 168\xe2\x80\x93169.</ref> "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" became one of his best known songs when The Byrds recorded an electric version that reached number one in the US and UK .<ref>{{cite book|author=Warwick, N., Brown, T. & Kutner, J.|year=2004|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|edition=Third|page=6|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84449-058-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitburn, J.|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955\xe2\x80\x932006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}</ref> "[[It\'s All Over Now, Baby Blue]]" and "[[It\'s Alright Ma (I\'m Only Bleeding)]]" were two of Dylan\'s most important compositions.<ref name = "Sounes-168"/><ref>Shelton, pp. 276\xe2\x80\x93277.</ref>

In 1965, heading the [[Newport Folk Festival]], Dylan performed his first electric set since high school with a [[pickup group]] mostly from the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], featuring [[Mike Bloomfield]] (guitar), [[Sam Lay]] (drums) and Jerome Arnold (bass), plus [[Al Kooper]] (organ) and [[Barry Goldberg]] (piano).<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 208\xe2\x80\x93216.</ref> Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version has it that the boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. [[Murray Lerner]], who filmed the performance, said: "I absolutely think that they were booing Dylan going electric."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/10/exclusive_dylan_at_newport_who.html| title = Exclusive: Dylan at Newport\xe2\x80\x94Who Booed?| work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]

Nevertheless, Dylan\'s performance provoked a hostile response from the folk music establishment.<ref>Shelton, pp. 305\xe2\x80\x93314.</ref><ref>A year earlier, [[Irwin Silber]], editor of \'\'[[Sing Out!]]\'\', had published an "Open Letter to Bob Dylan", criticizing Dylan\'s stepping away from political songwriting: "I saw at Newport how you had somehow lost contact with people. Some of the paraphernalia of fame were getting in your way." \'\'Sing Out!\'\', November 1964, quoted in Shelton, p. 313. This letter has been mistakenly described as a response to Dylan\'s 1965 Newport appearance.</ref> In the September issue of \'\'[[Sing Out!]]\'\', [[Ewan MacColl]] wrote: "Our traditional songs and ballads are the creations of extraordinarily talented artists working inside disciplines formulated over time&nbsp;...\'But what of Bobby Dylan?\' scream the outraged teenagers&nbsp;... Only a completely non-critical audience, nourished on the watery pap of pop music, could have fallen for such tenth-rate drivel."<ref>\'\'Sing Out!\'\', September 1965, quoted in Shelton, p. 313.</ref> On July 29, four days after Newport, Dylan was back in the studio in New York, recording "[[Positively 4th Street]]". The lyrics contained images of vengeance and paranoia,<ref>"You got a lotta nerve/To say you are my friend/When I was down/You just stood there grinning" Reproduced online:{{cite web | url = http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/positively-4th-street | title = Positively 4th Street| author=Bob Dylan| accessdate = April 21, 2015| publisher=bobdylan.com}}</ref> and it was interpreted as Dylan\'s put-down of former friends from the folk community \xe2\x80\x94 friends he had known in clubs along [[4th Street (Manhattan)|West 4th Street]].<ref>Sounes, p. 186.</ref>

====\'\'Highway 61 Revisited\'\' and \'\'Blonde on Blonde\'\'====
{{listen|filename=Bob Dylan - Like a Rolling Stone.ogg |title="Like a Rolling Stone"|description=Dylan\'s 1965 hit single, which appeared on the album \'\'Highway 61 Revisited\'\'.

In July 1965, the single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" peaked at two in the U.S. and at four in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song altered what a pop single could convey.

"[[Desolation Row]]", backed by [[acoustic guitar]] and understated bass,<ref>Polizzotti identifies [[Charlie McCoy]] on guitar and [[Russ Savakus]] on bass as the musicians, see Polizzotti, \'\'Highway 61 Revisited\'\', p. 133</ref> offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a [[Frederico Fellini|Fellini-esque]] parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical ([[Einstein]], [[Nero]]), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary ([[T.S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]]), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse."<ref>Gill, p. 89.</ref>

In support of the album, Dylan was booked for two U.S. concerts with Al Kooper and [[Harvey Brooks]] from his studio crew and [[Robbie Robertson]] and [[Levon Helm]], former members of [[Ronnie Hawkins]]\'s backing band [[The Hawks (band)|the Hawks]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 80\xe2\x80\x9381</ref> On August 28 at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium, the group was heckled by an audience still annoyed by Dylan\'s electric sound. The band\'s reception on September 3 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was more favorable.<ref>Sounes, pp. 189\xe2\x80\x9390.</ref>

From September 24, in Austin, Texas, Dylan toured the US and Canada for six months, backed by the five musicians from the Hawks who became known as [[the Band]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 82\xe2\x80\x9394</ref> While Dylan and the Hawks met increasingly receptive audiences, their studio efforts floundered. Producer [[Bob Johnston]] persuaded Dylan to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in February 1966, and surrounded him with top-notch session men. At Dylan\'s insistence, Robertson and Kooper came from New York City to play on the sessions.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 238\xe2\x80\x93243.</ref> The Nashville sessions produced the double album \'\'[[Blonde on Blonde]]\'\' (1966), featuring what Dylan called "that thin wild mercury sound".<ref>"The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the \'\'Blonde on Blonde\'\' album. It\'s that thin, that wild mercury sound. It\'s metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up." Dylan Interview, \'\'Playboy\'\', March 1978; reprinted in Cott, \'\'Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews\'\', p. 204.</ref> Kooper described it as "taking two cultures and smashing them together with a huge explosion": the musical world of Nashville and the world of the "quintessential New York hipster" Bob Dylan.<ref>Gill, p. 95.</ref>

On November 22, 1965, Dylan secretly married 25-year-old former model [[Sara Dylan|Sara Lownds]].<ref name = "Sounes-p193">Sounes, p. 193.</ref> Some of Dylan\'s friends, including Ramblin\' Jack Elliott, say that, immediately after the event, Dylan denied he was married.<ref name = "Sounes-p193"/> Journalist [[Nora Ephron]] made the news public in the \'\'[[New York Post]]\'\' in February 1966 with the headline "Hush! Bob Dylan is wed."<ref>Shelton, p. 325.</ref>

Dylan toured Australia and Europe in April and May 1966. Each show was split in two. Dylan performed solo during the first half, accompanying himself on [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and harmonica. In the second, backed by [[The Band#Early years: The Hawks|the Hawks]], he played electrically amplified music. This contrast provoked many fans, who jeered and [[Slow clap|slow handclapped]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 244\xe2\x80\x93261.</ref> The tour culminated in a raucous confrontation between Dylan and his audience at the Manchester [[Free Trade Hall]] in England on May 17, 1966.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nme.com/reviews/bob-dylan/199| title = Live 1966| date = September 6, 1998| accessdate =May 2, 2010|work=NME |location=UK }}</ref> A recording of this concert was released in 1998: \'\'[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]\'\'. At the climax of the evening, a member of the audience, angered by Dylan\'s electric backing, shouted: "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]!" to which Dylan responded, "I don\'t believe you&nbsp;... You\'re a liar!" Dylan turned to his band and said, "Play it fucking loud!"<ref>Dylan\'s dialogue with the Manchester audience is recorded (with subtitles) in Martin Scorsese\'s documentary \'\'[[No Direction Home]]\'\'</ref> as they launched into the final song of the night\xe2\x80\x94"Like a Rolling Stone".

During his 1966 tour, Dylan was described as exhausted and acting "as if on a death trip".<ref>Heylin (2011), p. 251.</ref> [[D. A.

====Motorcycle accident and reclusion====
After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] had paid an advance for a TV show.<ref>Sounes, p. 215.</ref> His publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel \'\'[[Tarantula (book)|Tarantula]].\'\' Manager [[Albert Grossman]] had scheduled a concert tour for that summer and fall.

On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc [[Triumph Tiger 100]] motorcycle near his home in [[Woodstock, New York]] and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several [[vertebrae]] in his neck.<ref name = "Sounes-217">Sounes, pp. 217\xe2\x80\x93219.</ref> Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061106200746/http://www.americanheritage.com/email/articles/web/20060729-bob-dylan-motorcycle-woodstock-methamphetamine-robert-shelton-howard-sounes-ed-thaler.shtml|title=The Bob Dylan Motorcycle-Crash Mystery|author = Scherman, Tony|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=June 18, 2014|publisher=American Heritage}}</ref> Dylan\'s biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him.<ref name = "Sounes-217"/><ref name="shades268">Heylin (2000), p. 268.</ref> Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I\'d been hurt, but I recovered.

Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit [[D. A. Pennebaker]]\'s film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] and rejected as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience.<ref>Sounes, p. 216.</ref> The film was subsequently titled \'\'[[Eat the Document]]\'\' on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals.<ref>Lee, pp. 39\xe2\x80\x9363.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233629/| title = \'\'Eat the Document\'\' on IMDb| accessdate = September 27, 2013| publisher = imdb.com}}</ref> In 1967 he began recording with the Hawks at his home and in the basement of the Hawks\' nearby house, "Big Pink".<ref>Sounes, pp. 222\xe2\x80\x93225.</ref> These songs, initially demos for other artists to record, provided hits for [[Julie Driscoll]] and [[the Brian Auger Trinity]] ("[[This Wheel\'s on Fire (song)|This Wheel\'s on Fire]]"), [[The Byrds]] ("[[You Ain\'t Goin\' Nowhere]]", "Nothing Was Delivered"), and [[Manfred Mann]] ("[[Quinn the Eskimo (Mighty Quinn)|Mighty Quinn]]"). Columbia released selections in 1975 as \'\'[[The Basement Tapes]]\'\'. Over the years, more songs recorded by Dylan and his band in 1967 appeared on [[bootleg recording]]s, culminating in a five-CD set titled \'\'The Genuine Basement Tapes\'\', containing [[List of Basement Tapes songs|107 songs and alternative takes]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 236\xe2\x80\x93265.</ref> In the coming months, the Hawks recorded the album \'\'[[Music from Big Pink]]\'\' using songs they worked on in their basement in Woodstock, and renamed themselves [[the Band]],<ref>Helm, Levon and Davis, \'\'This Wheel\'s on Fire\'\', p. 164; p. 174.</ref> beginning a long recording and performing career of their own.

In October and November 1967, Dylan returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref name = "BjornerJWH">{{cite web| title = Columbia Studio A, Nashville, Tennessee, John Wesley Harding sessions| url = http://www.bjorner.com/DSN01620%201967.htm#DSN01640| accessdate =November 10, 2008| publisher=Bjorner\'s Still On the Road}}</ref> Back in the studio after a 19 months, he was accompanied by [[Charlie McCoy]] on bass,<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> [[Kenny Buttrey]] on drums,<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> and [[Pete Drake]] on steel guitar.<ref name = "BjornerJWH"/> The result was \'\'[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]\'\', a contemplative record of shorter songs, set in a landscape that drew on the [[American West]] and the Bible. The sparse structure and instrumentation, with lyrics that took the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition seriously, departed from Dylan\'s own work and from the psychedelic fervor of the 1960s.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 282\xe2\x80\x93288.</ref> It included "[[All Along the Watchtower]]", with lyrics derived from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (21:5\xe2\x80\x939).

Dylan\'s next release, \'\'[[Nashville Skyline]]\'\' (1969), was mainstream country featuring Nashville musicians, a mellow-voiced Dylan, a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and the hit single "[[Lay Lady Lay]]".<ref>Gill, p. 140.</ref> \'\'[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\'\' wrote, "Dylan is definitely doing something that can be called singing. Somehow he has managed to add an octave to his range."<ref>Shelton (2011), p. 273.</ref> Dylan and Cash also recorded a series of duets, but only their recording of Dylan\'s "[[Girl from the North Country]]" was used on the album.

In May 1969, Dylan appeared on the first episode of [[Johnny Cash]]\'s television show, duetting with Cash on "[[Girl from the North Country]]", "I Threw It All Away", and "Living the Blues". Dylan next traveled to England to top the bill at the [[Isle of Wight]] festival on August 31, 1969, after rejecting overtures to appear at the [[Woodstock Festival]] closer to his home.<ref>Sounes, pp. 248\xe2\x80\x93253.</ref>

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, critics charged that Dylan\'s output was varied and unpredictable. \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' writer [[Greil Marcus]] asked "What is this shit?" on first listening to \'\'[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self Portrait]]\'\', released in June 1970.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/15/bob-dylan-writings-marcus-review| title = Bob Dylan: Writings 1968\xe2\x80\x932010 by Greil Marcus| author = Ford, Mark| date = May 14, 2011| accessdate = August 20, 2011| publisher = guardian.co.uk| location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2007/11/bob_dylan.html | title = Bob Dylan\xe2\x80\x94Disc of the Day: \'\'Self Portrait\'\' | last = Male | first = Andrew | date = November 26, 2007 | accessdate =September 24, 2008 | publisher=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]}}</ref> \'\'Self Portrait\'\', a double LP including few original songs, was poorly received.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Bob+Dylan| title = Self Portrait| author=Christgau, Robert| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> In October 1970, Dylan released \'\'[[New Morning]]\'\', considered a return to form.<ref>Shelton, p. 482.</ref> In November 1968, Dylan had co-written "[[I\'d Have You Anytime]]" with [[George Harrison]];<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 391\xe2\x80\x93392.</ref> Harrison recorded "I\'d Have You Anytime" and Dylan\'s "[[If Not for You]]" for his 1970 solo triple album \'\'[[All Things Must Pass]]\'\'.

Between March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock, a small studio in [[Greenwich Village]]. These sessions resulted in "[[Watching the River Flow]]" and a new recording of "[[When I Paint My Masterpiece]]".<ref>Heylin (1996), p. 128.</ref> On November 4, 1971, Dylan recorded "[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]", which he released a week later. For many, the single was a surprising return to protest material, mourning the killing of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] in [[San Quentin State Prison]] that year.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 342\xe2\x80\x93343.</ref> Dylan contributed piano and harmony to [[Steve Goodman]]\'s album, \'\'Somebody Else\'s Troubles\'\', under the pseudonym Robert Milkwood Thomas in September 1972.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 267.</ref>

In 1972, Dylan signed to [[Sam Peckinpah]]\'s film \'\'[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]\'\', providing [[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (album)|songs and backing music]] for the movie, and playing "Alias", a member of Billy\'s gang with some historical basis.<ref>C. P. Lee wrote: "In Garrett\'s ghost-written memoir, \'\'[[The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid]]\'\', published within a year of Billy\'s death, he wrote that \'Billy\'s partner doubtless had a name which was his legal property, but he was so given to changing it that it is impossible to fix on the right one.

====Return to touring====

Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, [[David Geffen]]\'s [[Asylum Records]], when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, \'\'[[Planet Waves]]\'\', he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of "Forever Young", which became one of his most popular songs.<ref name = "Sounes-p273">Sounes, pp. 273\xe2\x80\x93274.</ref> As one critic described it, the song projected "something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan",<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 354.</ref> and Dylan himself commented: "I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental."<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>

Columbia Records simultaneously released \'\'[[Dylan (1973 album)|Dylan]]\'\', a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan\'s signing with a rival record label.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 358.</ref> In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|North American tour]]of 40 concerts. A live double album, \'\'[[Before the Flood]]\'\', was on Asylum Records. Soon, Columbia Records said word they "will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold".<ref name = "Shelton-378">Shelton, p. 37.</ref> Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of \'\'Planet Waves\'\'.<ref name = "Shelton-378"/> Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums.

 |description= Dylan said of the opening song from \'\'[[Blood on the Tracks]]\'\': "I was trying to deal with the concept of time, and the way the characters change from the first person to the third person, and you\'re never sure if the first person is talking or the third person. But as you look at the whole thing it really doesn\'t matter."<ref name = "Crowe-1985"/>
 |format = [[Ogg]]}}

After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled \'\'[[Blood on the Tracks]]\'\' in September 1974.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 368\xe2\x80\x93383.</ref> Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at [[Sound 80]] Studios in [[Minneapolis]] with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 369\xe2\x80\x93387.</ref>

Released in early 1975, \'\'[[Blood on the Tracks]]\'\' received mixed reviews. In the \'\'[[NME]]\'\', [[Nick Kent]] described "the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes."<ref name = "Heylin 383">Heylin (2000), p. 383.</ref> In \'\'Rolling Stone\'\', [[Jon Landau]] wrote that "the record has been made with typical shoddiness."<ref name = "Heylin 383"/> Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan\'s greatest achievements. In [[Salon.com]], [[Bill Wyman]] wrote: "\'\'Blood on the Tracks\'\' is his only flawless album and his best produced; the songs, each of them, are constructed in disciplined fashion. It is his kindest album and most dismayed, and seems in hindsight to have achieved a sublime balance between the logorrhea-plagued excesses of his mid-1960s output and the self-consciously simple compositions of his post-accident years."<ref>{{cite news | title = Bob Dylan | publisher=[[Salon.com]] | date = May 5, 2001 | url = http://www.salon.com/2001/05/22/dylan_3/ | accessdate =September 7, 2008 }}</ref> Novelist [[Rick Moody]] called it "the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape."<ref>Hedin, p. 109.</ref>

That summer Dylan wrote a ballad championing boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin "Hurricane" Carter]], imprisoned for a triple murder in [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], New Jersey, in 1966. After visiting Carter in jail, Dylan wrote "[[Hurricane (song)|Hurricane]]", presenting the case for Carter\'s innocence.

Running through late 1975 and again through early 1976, the tour encompassed the release of the album \'\'[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]\'\', with many of Dylan\'s new songs featuring an [[travel literature|travelogue]]-like narrative style, showing the influence of his new collaborator, playwright [[Jacques Levy]].<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 386\xe2\x80\x93401,</ref><ref>Gray (2006), p. 408.</ref> The 1976 half of the tour was documented by a TV concert special, \'\'Hard Rain\'\', and the LP \'\'[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]\'\'; no concert album from the better-received and better-known opening half of the tour was released until 2002\'s \'\'[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue|Live 1975]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web

Let\'s just make an album."<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 501\xe2\x80\x93503.</ref> The album won a [[Grammy Award]] as "Best Male Vocalist" for the song "[[Gotta Serve Somebody]]". The second evangelical album, \'\'[[Saved (album)|Saved]]\'\' (1980), received mixed reviews, described by Michael Gray as "the nearest thing to a follow-up album Dylan has ever made, \'\'Slow Train Coming II\'\' and inferior."<ref>Gray (2000), p. 11.</ref> When touring in late 1979 and early 1980, Dylan would not play his older, secular works, and he delivered declarations of his faith from the stage, such as:

===1980s===
[[File:Bob Dylan in Toronto2.jpg|thumb|alt=Dylan, onstage and with eyes closed, plays a chord on an electric guitar.|Dylan in Toronto April 18, 1980]]
In late 1980 Dylan briefly played concerts billed as "A Musical Retrospective", restoring popular 1960s songs to the repertoire. \'\'[[Shot of Love]]\'\', recorded next spring, featured his first secular compositions in more than two years, mixed with Christian songs. "[[Every Grain of Sand (Bob Dylan song)|Every Grain of Sand]]" reminded some of [[William Blake]]\'s verses.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 215\xe2\x80\x93221.</ref>

In the 1980s reception of Dylan\'s recordings varied, from the well-regarded \'\'[[Infidels (Bob Dylan album)|Infidels]]\'\' in 1983 to the panned \'\'[[Down in the Groove]]\'\' in 1988. Michael Gray condemned Dylan\'s 1980s albums for carelessness in the studio and for failing to release his best songs.<ref>Gray (2000), pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9314.</ref> As an example of the latter, the \'\'Infidels\'\' recording sessions, which again employed Knopfler on lead guitar and also as the album\'s producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were "[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]", a tribute to the [[Blind Willie McTell|dead blues musician]] and an evocation of [[African American history]],<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 56\xe2\x80\x9359.</ref> "Foot of Pride" and "[[Lord Protect My Child]]". These three songs were released on \'\'[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\xe2\x80\x933 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\xe2\x80\x931991]]\'\'.<ref>Sounes, pp. 354\xe2\x80\x93356.</ref>

Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded \'\'[[Empire Burlesque]]\'\'.<ref name = Sounes362>Sounes, p. 362.</ref> [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], who had remixed hits for [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan\'s album sound "a little bit more contemporary".<ref name = Sounes362/>

Dylan sang on [[USA for Africa]]\'s famine relief single "[[We Are the World]]". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the [[Live Aid]] concert at [[JFK Stadium]], Philadelphia. Backed by [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], he performed a ragged version of "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: "I hope that some of the money&nbsp;... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe&nbsp;... one or two million, maybe&nbsp;... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."<ref>Sounes, p. 367.</ref> His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire [[Willie Nelson]] to organize a series of events, [[Farm Aid]], to benefit debt-ridden American farmers.<ref>Sounes, pp. 365\xe2\x80\x93367.</ref>

In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into [[rap music]] when he added vocals to the opening verse of "Street Rock", featured on [[Kurtis Blow]]\'s album \'\'Kingdom Blow\'\'.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 63</ref> Dylan\'s next studio album, \'\'[[Knocked Out Loaded]]\'\', in July 1986 contained three covers (by Little [[Junior Parker]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and the gospel hymn "[[Precious Memories (hymn)|Precious Memories]]"), plus three collaborations with ([[Tom Petty]], [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]]), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that "the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren\'t entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn\'t make them any less frustrating."<ref>{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6448|pure_url=yes}}| title = Knocked Out Loaded| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate =May 2, 2010| publisher=allmusic}}</ref> It was the first Dylan album since \'\'[[The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan|Freewheelin\']]\'\' (1963) to fail to make the Top 50.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 595.</ref> Since then, some critics have called the 11-minute epic that Dylan co-wrote with Sam Shepard, "[[Brownsville Girl]]", a work of genius.<ref>Gray (2006), pp. 95\xe2\x80\x93100.</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the [[Grateful Dead]] in 1987, resulting in a live album \'\'[[Dylan & The Dead]]\'\'. This received negative reviews: \'\'[[Allmusic]]\'\' said, "Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the Grateful Dead."<ref>{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r54428|pure_url=yes}}
| title = Dylan & The Dead| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | date = July 27, 1989| accessdate =September 10, 2009| publisher=allmusic.com}}</ref> Dylan then initiated what came to be called the [[Never Ending Tour]] on June 7, 1988, performing with a back-up band featuring guitarist [[G. E. Smith]]. Dylan continued to tour with a small, evolving band for the next 20 years.<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 297\xe2\x80\x93299.</ref>

[[File:Bob Dylan Barcelona.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Dylan plays his guitar and sings into a microphone onstage.|Dylan in [[Barcelona, Spain|Barcelona]], Spain, 1984]]
In 1987, Dylan starred in [[Richard Marquand]]\'s movie \'\'[[Hearts of Fire]]\'\', in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover, ([[Fiona (singer)|Fiona]]), leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by [[Rupert Everett]].<ref>Sounes, pp. 376\xe2\x80\x93383.</ref> Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack\xe2\x80\x94"Night After Night", and "I Had a Dream About You, Baby", as well as a cover of [[John Hiatt]]\'s "The Usual". The film was a critical and commercial flop.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 599\xe2\x80\x93604.</ref>
Dylan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen\'s introduction declaring, "Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.<ref>Speech on Bob Dylan\'s induction to the Rock\'n\'Roll Hall of Fame, January 20, 1988, reprinted in Bauldie, pp. 191\xe2\x80\x93193.</ref>

The album \'\'[[Down in the Groove]]\'\' in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album.<ref name = "Sounes 385">Sounes, p. 385.</ref> Michael Gray wrote: "The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13">Gray (2000), p. 13.</ref> The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. Dylan co-founded the band with [[George Harrison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Tom Petty]], and in late 1988 their multi-platinum \'\'[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]\'\' reached three on the US album chart,<ref name = "Sounes 385"/> featuring songs that were described as Dylan\'s most accessible compositions in years.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 627\xe2\x80\x93628.</ref> Despite Orbison\'s death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title \'\'[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]\'\'.<ref>Heylin (2000), pp. 638\xe2\x80\x93640.</ref>

Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with \'\'[[Oh Mercy]]\'\' produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s."<ref name="Gray 2000, p. 13"/><ref>Dylan, pp. 145\xe2\x80\x93221.</ref> The track "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film \'\'[[High Fidelity (film)|High Fidelity]]\'\', while "What Was It You Wanted?" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.<ref>Ricks, pp. 413\xe2\x80\x9320.</ref> The religious imagery of "Ring Them Bells" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.<ref>Scott Marshall wrote: "When Dylan sings that \'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow\', it\'s safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God." Marshall, \'\'Restless Pilgrim\'\', p. 103.</ref>

===1990s===
Dylan\'s 1990s began with \'\'[[Under the Red Sky]]\'\' (1990), an about-face from the serious \'\'Oh Mercy\'\'. The album contained several apparently simple songs, including "Under the Red Sky" and "Wiggle Wiggle". The album was dedicated to "Gabby Goo Goo", a nickname for the daughter of Dylan and [[Carolyn Dennis]], Desiree Gabrielle Dennis-Dylan, who was four.<ref>Gray (2006), p. 174.</ref> [[Sidemen]] on the album included George Harrison, [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] from [[Guns N\' Roses]], [[David Crosby]], [[Bruce Hornsby]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and [[Elton John]]. Despite the line-up, the record received bad reviews and sold poorly.<ref>Sounes, p. 391.</ref>

In 1991, Dylan received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] from American actor [[Jack Nicholson]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/lifetime-awards| title = Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award| accessdate =September 25, 2008| publisher=Grammy.com}}</ref> The event coincided with the start of the [[Gulf War]] against [[Saddam Hussein]], and Dylan performed "[[Masters of War]]". Dylan then made a short speech, saying "My daddy once said to me, he said, \'Son, it is possible for you to become so defiled in this world that your own mother and father will abandon you. If that happens, God will believe in your ability to mend your own ways.\'"<ref name = "Heylin-664">Heylin (2000), pp. 664\xe2\x80\x93665.</ref> This sentiment was subsequently revealed to be a quote from 19th-century German Jewish intellectual, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].<ref>Bell, 2012, \'\'Once Upon a Time: The Lives of Bob Dylan.\'\', p. 101.</ref>

The next few years saw Dylan returning to his roots with two albums covering folk and blues numbers: \'\'[[Good as I Been to You]]\'\' (1992) and \'\'[[World Gone Wrong]]\'\' (1993), featuring interpretations and acoustic guitar work. Many critics and fans commented on the quiet beauty of the song "Lone Pilgrim",<ref>Gray (2006), p. 423.</ref> written by a 19th-century teacher. In November 1994 Dylan recorded two live shows for \'\'[[MTV Unplugged]]\'\'. He said his wish to perform traditional songs was overruled by [[Sony]] executives who insisted on hits.<ref>Sounes, pp. 408\xe2\x80\x93409.</ref> The album from it, \'\'[[MTV Unplugged (Bob Dylan album)|MTV Unplugged]]\'\', included "John Brown", an unreleased 1962 song of how enthusiasm for war ends in mutilation and disillusionment.<ref>Heylin (2009), pp. 100\xe2\x80\x93101.</ref>
[[File:B dylan 1996.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dylan and members of his band perform onstage. Dylan, wearing a red shirt and black pants, plays an electric guitar and sings.|Dylan performs at a 1996 concert in [[Stockholm]]]]

With a collection of songs reportedly written while snowed-in on his Minnesota ranch,<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 693.</ref> Dylan booked recording time with [[Daniel Lanois]] at [[Miami]]\'s [[Criteria Studios]] in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension.<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 697.</ref> Late that spring, before the album\'s release, Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, [[pericarditis]], brought on by [[histoplasmosis]]. His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, "I really thought I\'d be seeing [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] soon."<ref>Sounes, p. 420.</ref> He was back on the road by midsummer, and performed before [[Pope John Paul II]] at the World Eucharistic Conference in [[Bologna]], Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan\'s lyric "Blowin\' in the Wind".<ref>Sounes, p. 426.</ref>

September saw the release of the new Lanois-produced album, \'\'[[Time Out of Mind]]\'\'. With its bitter assessment of love and morbid ruminations, Dylan\'s first collection of original songs in seven years was highly acclaimed. One critic wrote: "the songs themselves are uniformly powerful, adding up to Dylan\'s best overall collection in years."<ref>{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r314906|pure_url=yes}}| title = Time Out of Mind| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| accessdate =May 1, 2010| publisher=allmusic}}</ref> This collection of complex songs won him his first solo "Album of the Year" [[Grammy Award]].<ref>Dylan had been one of several artists who had won "Album of the Year" in 1971 for \'\'[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]\'\'{{cite web

In December 1997, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] presented Dylan with a [[Kennedy Center]] Honor in the East Room of the [[White House]], paying this tribute: "He probably had more impact on people of my generation than any other creative artist. His voice and lyrics haven\'t always been easy on the ear, but throughout his career Bob Dylan has never aimed to please. He\'s disturbed the peace and discomforted the powerful."<ref>{{cite news| url = http://clinton4.nara.gov/textonly/WH/New/html/19971208-2814.html

In 1999, Dylan embarked on a North American tour with [[Paul Simon]], where each alternated as headline act with a "middle" section where they performed together, starting on the first of June and ending September 18. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy, from the \'\'Berkshire Eagle\'\', questioning the collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshireweb.com/rogovoy/interviews/dylan716.html |title=Bob Dylan and Paul Simon: A mismatch made in heaven? by Seth Rogovoy |publisher=Berkshireweb.com |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 2003, Dylan revisited the evangelical songs from his "born again" period and participated in the CD project \'\'[[Gotta Serve Somebody: The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan]]\'\'. That year also saw the release of the film \'\'[[Masked & Anonymous]]\'\', which Dylan co-wrote with director [[Larry Charles]] under the alias Sergei Petrov.<ref>Dylan co-wrote \'\'[[Masked & Anonymous]]\'\' under the pseudonym Seregei Petrov, taken from an actor in the silent movie era; Larry Charles used the alias Rene Fontaine.

Dylan earned yet another distinction in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers more than those of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by [[the Beatles]], who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were [[US Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included "you don\'t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows" from "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]" and "when you ain\'t got nothing, you got nothing to lose" from "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".<ref>{{cite news |first=Carol J. |last=Williams |title=Judges hand down the law with help from Bob Dylan |date=May 9, 2011 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/09/local/la-me-bob-dylan-law-20110509 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Robert (host)|last=Siegel |date=May 10, 2011 |title=Bob Dylan\'s Words Find Place In Legal Writings |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/05/10/136181949/bob-dylans-words-find-place-in-legal-writings |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

Bob Dylan released his album \'\'[[Together Through Life]]\'\' on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan\'s website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director [[Olivier Dahan]] asked him to supply a song for his new [[road movie]], \'\'[[My Own Love Song]]\'\'; initially only intending to record a single track, "Life Is Hard," "the record sort of took its own direction".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bobdylan.com/conversation| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110425235613/http://www.bobdylan.com/conversation| archivedate = 2011-04-25| title = Bob Dylan talks about the new album with Bill Flanagan| author=Flanagan, Bill| date = April 10, 2009| accessdate =March 30, 2012| publisher=bobdylan.com}}</ref> Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]].<ref>{{cite web

Andy Gill wrote in \'\'[[The Independent]]\'\' that the record "features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar.

In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery, London, hosted an exhibition of seven wrought iron gates that Dylan had created. The exhibition was titled \'\'Mood Swings\'\'. In a statement released by the gallery, Dylan said: "I\'ve been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.artlyst.com/articles/the-legendary-bob-dylan-unveils-seven-iron-gates-sculpture| title = The Legendary Bob Dylan Unveils Seven Iron Gates Sculpture| date = September 24, 2013| accessdate = November 16, 2013

===Religious beliefs===
Growing up in [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area\'s small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>According to Robert Shelton, Dylan\'s teacher was "Rabbi Reuben Maier of the only synagogue on the [[Iron Range]], Hibbing\'s Agudath Achim Synagogue".

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dylan converted to Christianity. From January to April 1979, he participated in Bible study classes at the [[Association of Vineyard Churches|Vineyard School of Discipleship]] in [[Reseda, California|Reseda]], California. Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: "Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob\'s house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, \'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.\' And he prayed that day and received the Lord."<ref>Heylin (2000), p. 494.</ref><ref>Gray (2006), pp. 76\xe2\x80\x9380.</ref>

By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the "[[Born again (Christianity)|born again]]" label. He told [[Kurt Loder]] of \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine: "I\'ve never said I\'m born again. That\'s just a media term. I don\'t think I\'ve been an [[agnosticism|agnostic]]. I\'ve always thought there\'s a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there\'s a world to come." In response to Loder\'s asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, "Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind."<ref>\'\'Rolling Stone\'\', June 21, 1984, reprinted in Cott (ed.), \'\'Dylan on Dylan: The Essential Interviews\'\', p. 288.</ref> In 1997 he told [[David Gates (author)|David Gates]] of \'\'[[Newsweek]]\'\':

Dylan has been a supporter of the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] movement in the last 20 years,<ref>Fishkoff, p. 167.</ref> and has privately participated in Jewish religious events, including the [[Bar Mitzvah]]s of his sons and attending [[Hadar Hatorah]], a [[Chabad Lubavitch]] [[yeshiva]]. In September 1989 and September 1991, he appeared on the Chabad [[telethon]].<ref>Heylin (1996), pp. 317, 343.</ref> Dylan reportedly visits [[Chabad|Chabad synagogues]]; on [[Yom Kippur]] in 2007 he attended Congregation Beth Tefillah, in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he was called to the [[Torah]] for the sixth [[Baal kore|aliyah]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Arutz| last=Sheva | title = Day of Atonement Draws Dylan to the Torah | publisher=Arutz Sheva\xe2\x80\x94Israel National News | date = September 24, 2007 | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/133709| accessdate =September 11, 2008}}</ref>

Dylan has continued to perform songs from his gospel albums in concert, occasionally covering traditional religious songs. He has also made passing references to his religious faith\xe2\x80\x94such as in a 2004 interview with \'\'[[60 Minutes]]\'\', when he told [[Ed Bradley]] that "the only person you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God."

In a 2009 interview with Bill Flanagan promoting Dylan\'s Christmas LP, \'\'[[Christmas in the Heart]]\'\', Flanagan commented on the "heroic performance" Dylan gave of "[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]" and that he "delivered the song like a true believer".

When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to a rock backing, the mix became more complex. For many critics, his greatest achievement was the cultural synthesis exemplified by his mid-1960s trilogy of albums\xe2\x80\x94\'\'Bringing It All Back Home\'\', \'\'Highway 61 Revisited\'\' and \'\'Blonde on Blonde\'\'. In [[Mike Marqusee]]\'s words: 
<blockquote>
Between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, Dylan created a body of work that remains unique. Drawing on folk, blues, country, R&B, rock\'n\'roll, gospel, British beat, [[Symbolist poetry|symbolist]], [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist]] and [[Beat poetry]], [[surrealism]] and [[Dada]], advertising jargon and social commentary, [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and [[Mad magazine|\'\'Mad\'\' magazine]], he forged a coherent and original artistic voice and vision. The beauty of these albums retains the power to shock and console."<ref name="Marqusee139">Marqusee, p. 139.</ref></blockquote>

Dylan\'s work began to receive detailed scrutiny from academics and poets in regard to his lyrics. Literary critic [[Christopher Ricks]] published a 500-page analysis of Dylan\'s work, placing him in the context of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred Tennyson|Tennyson]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Ricks|title=Dylan\'s Visions of Sin|publisher=Penguin/Viking|year=2003|isbn=0-670-80133-X}}</ref> claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2004/jul/13/academicexperts.highereducationprofile | title = Ricks profile: Someone\'s gotta hold of his art | author=MacLeod, Donald | date = July 13, 2004 | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}</ref> Former British [[poet laureate]] Sir [[Andrew Motion]] argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/poetry/article2503109.ece| title = Andrew Motion explains why Bob Dylan\'s lyrics should be studied in schools | author=Motion, Andrew| date = September 22, 2007| accessdate =October 10, 2008| work=The Times | location=London}}</ref> Since 1996, academics have lobbied the [[Swedish Academy]] to award Dylan the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.expectingrain.com/dok/art/nobel/nobelpress.html | title = Finally and Formally Launched as a Candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1997 |accessdate=September 7, 2008| publisher=expectingrain.com | date = May 24, 2002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ball|first=Gordon| url = http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/22i/Ball.pdf |format=PDF| title = Dylan and the Nobel| accessdate =September 7, 2008 | work=[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]] | date = March 7, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/06/entertainment/main647862.shtml | title = Dylan\'s Words Strike Nobel Debate | accessdate =September 7, 2008 | publisher=CBS News | date = October 6, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/19/bob-dylan-nobel-odds-rise-literature| title = Bob Dylan\'s Nobel odds rise, but not his chances| author = Flood, Alison| date = September 19, 2012| accessdate = September 20, 2012| publisher = \'\'The Guardian\'\'| location=London}}</ref>

Dylan\'s voice also received critical attention. \'\'New York Times\'\' critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as "a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie\'s old performances, etched in gravel like [[Dave Van Ronk|Dave Van Ronk\'s]]."<ref>Shelton, pp. 108\xe2\x80\x93111.</ref> [[David Bowie]], in his tribute, "[[Song for Bob Dylan]]", described Dylan\'s singing as "a voice like sand and glue". His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock\'n\'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan\'s vocal work on "Like a Rolling Stone" as "at once young and jeeringly cynical".<ref>Gray (2006), p. 413.</ref> As Dylan\'s voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal \'\'[[Oral Tradition Journal|Oral Tradition]]\'\', "Dylan\'s more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs\xe2\x80\x94this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world.

Dylan\'s oeuvre has influenced several musical genres.

Some critics have dissented from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book \'\'Awopbopaloobop Alopbamboom\'\', [[Nik Cohn]] objected: "I can\'t take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage messiah, as everything else he\'s been worshipped as.

Fellow musicians also presented dissenting views. [[Joni Mitchell]] described Dylan as a "plagiarist" and his voice as "fake" in a 2010 interview in the \'\'[[Los Angeles Times]]\'\', in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both created personas.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/22/entertainment/la-et-jonimitchell-20100422/2| title = It\'s a Joni Mitchell concert| author=Diehl, Matt| date = April 22, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Bethany|last=Larson| title=Folk Face-Off: Joni Mitchell vs. Bob Dylan | url=http://flavorwire.com/85781/folk-face-off-joni-mitchell-vs-bob-dylan|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=August 4, 2011|publisher=Flavorwire.com}}</ref> Mitchell\'s comment led to discussions of Dylan\'s use of other people\'s material, both supporting and criticizing him.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/04/30/is-bob-dylan-a-phony.html | title = Is Bob Dylan a Phony?| author=Wilentz, Sean| authorlink = Sean Wilentz | date = April 30, 2010| accessdate =May 2, 2010| work=The Daily Beast}}</ref> In 2013 Mitchell told the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)]] in an interview that her remarks in the \'\'Los Angeles Times\'\' had been taken "completely out of context", and that the interviewer was a "moron". Mitchell added: "I like a lot of Bob\'s songs. Musically he\'s not very gifted. He\'s borrowed his voice from old hillbillies. He\'s got a lot of borrowed things. He\'s not a great guitar player.

Talking to [[Mikal Gilmore]] in \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' in 2012, Dylan responded to the allegation of plagiarism, including his use of [[Henry Timrod|Henry Timrod\'s]] verse in his album \'\'Modern Times\'\',<ref name = "nytTimrod"/> by saying that it was "part of the tradition".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-unleashed-a-wild-ride-on-his-new-lp-and-striking-back-at-critics-20120927?page=7| title = Bob Dylan Unleashed| author = Gilmore, Mikal| date = September 27, 2012| accessdate = January 11, 2013| publisher = rollingstone.com}}</ref><ref group=a>Dylan told Gilmore: "As far as Henry Timrod is concerned, have you even heard of him?

Wussies and pussies complain about that stuff. It\'s an old thing \xe2\x80\x93 it\'s part of the tradition."</ref>

If Dylan\'s work in the 1960s was seen as bringing intellectual ambition to popular music,<ref name="Marqusee139"/> critics in the 21st century described him as a figure who had greatly expanded the folk culture from which he initially emerged. Following the release of [[Todd Haynes|Todd Haynes\']] Dylan biopic \'\'[[I\'m Not There]]\'\', [[J. Hoberman]] wrote in his 2007 \'\'[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]\'\' review:

<blockquote>Elvis might never have been born, but someone else would surely have brought the world rock \'n\' roll. No such logic accounts for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world\'s first and greatest rock \'n\' roll beatnik bard and then\xe2\x80\x94having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning\xe2\x80\x94vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-11-13/film/like-a-complete-unknown-i-m-not-there-and-the-changing-face-of-bob-dylan-on-film/| title = Like A Complete Unknown| author=Hoberman, J. | date = November 20, 2007| accessdate =October 5, 2008| work=The Village Voice }}</ref></blockquote>

Prior to the June 2014 sale of the original lyrics of "Like a Rolling Stone", written on four sheets of hotel stationery by Dylan in 1965, Richard Austin, of [[Sotheby\'s]], New York, said: "Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less. By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music."<ref name="Sale" /><ref name = "nyt">{{cite news| url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/handwritten-manuscripts-for-dylans-like-a-rolling-stone-to-be-auctioned/ | title = Dylan\'s Handwritten Lyrics to \'Like a Rolling Stone\' to Be Auctioned| author = Kozinn, Alan| date = April 30, 2014| accessdate = April 30, 2014| work = The New York Times}}</ref>

Hiatt was working as a songwriter for Tree International, a [[record label]] in Nashville, when his song "[[Sure As I\'m Sittin\' Here]]" was covered by [[Three Dog Night]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  The song became a [[Top 40]] [[hit record|hit]], earning Hiatt a [[recording contract]]  with [[Epic Records]]. Since then he has released twenty one studio [[album]]s, two [[compilation album]]s and one [[live album]]. His songs have been covered by a variety of artists in multiple genres, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Willy DeVille]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[B.B.

==Musical career==

===Early life and career===
Hiatt was born in 1952 to Ruth and Robert Hiatt, the sixth of seven children in a Roman Catholic family from Indianapolis. When he was nine years old, Hiatt\'s 21-year-old brother Michael committed [[suicide]]. Only two years later, his father died after a long sickness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/12/magazine/rocker-john-hiatt-as-good-as-his-words.html |title=Rocker John Hiatt: As Good As His Words - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-03-12 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref> To escape from the stress of his early life, Hiatt watched [[IndyCar]] racing and listened to [[Elvis Presley]], Bob Dylan, and the [[blues]]. In his youth, Hiatt reports that he and several others stole a [[Ford Thunderbird]], a crime for which he was caught by the owners but got away with, posing as a [[hitchhiker]].  He learned to play the guitar when he was eleven, and began his musical career in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] as a teenager.<ref name="unicom1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/interview-rso.html |title=Rolling Stone Online: John Hiatt Interview |publisher=Unicom.com |date=1997-06-29 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref>  He played in a variety of local clubs, most notably the Hummingbird.  Hiatt played with a variety of bands, including The Four-Fifths and John Lynch & the Hangmen.

He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] when he was eighteen years old and got a job as a songwriter for the Tree-Music Publishing Company for twenty-five dollars a week.<ref name="unicom1"/> Hiatt, who was unable to read or write scores, had to record all 250 songs he wrote for the company.  He also began playing with the band White Duck, as one of three [[singer-songwriter]]s within the group. White Duck had already recorded one album before Hiatt joined.  He wrote and performed two songs on their second album, \'\'In Season\'\', one of which was the hit "Train to Birmingham" (1972).  Hiatt performed live in many clubs around Nashville with White Duck, and as a solo act.

===Early solo career (1974\xe2\x80\x9378)===
Hiatt met [[Don Ellis]] of [[Epic Records]] in 1973, and received a record deal, releasing his first single, "We Make Spirit," later that year.  That same year Hiatt wrote the song "Sure As I\'m Sitting Here," which was recorded by Three Dog Night,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and went to number 16 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[record chart|chart]] in 1974.

In 1974 he released \'\'[[Hangin\' Around the Observatory]]\'\', which was a critical success but a commercial failure.  A year later, \'\'[[Overcoats]]\'\' was released, and when it also failed to sell, [[Epic Records|Epic]] released Hiatt from his contract.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> For the next four years he was without a recording contract.  During this time his style evolved from country-rock to [[New wave music|new wave]] influenced rock in the style of [[Elvis Costello]], Nick Lowe and [[Graham Parker]].

===The MCA/Geffen Years (1979\xe2\x80\x931986)===
Hiatt was picked up by the [[MCA Records|MCA]] label in 1979. He released two albums for the label -- \'\'[[Slug Line]]\'\' (1979) and \'\'[[Two Bit Monsters]]\'\' (1980) -- neither of which met with commercial success.  He received a few good reviews for these albums by critics in the [[Netherlands]]. He performed at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in Amsterdam for the first time in 1979 (opening for [[Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes]]) and came back often and built a solid fan base. In 1982, "Across the Borderline", written by Hiatt with [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Jim Dickinson]], appeared on the soundtrack to the motion picture "The Border" sung by country star [[Freddy Fender]].  The song would later be covered on albums by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Paul Young]], [[Rub\xc3\xa9n Blades]] and [[Willy DeVille]], among others, as well as by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and Bob Dylan in concert.  Hiatt was signed to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] (which would later absorb MCA) in 1982, where he recorded three diverse albums from 1982-85.  The first, \'\'[[All of a Sudden]]\'\' was [[record producer|produced]] by [[Tony Visconti]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and featured use of keyboards and synthesizers; his future albums combined [[Country music|country]] and [[soul music|soul]] influences. \'\'[[Riding With the King]]\'\' appeared in 1983, produced by [[Scott Mathews]], [[Ron Nagle]] and [[Nick Lowe]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Hiatt began making \'critics choice\' lists and building a large European following. The title track (taken from an odd dream Scott Mathews had) was re-recorded two decades later by Eric Clapton and B.B. King and went double platinum.

During this period, Rosanne Cash covered several Hiatt compositions, taking "It Hasn\'t Happened Yet" to the Top 20 on the country charts.  In 1983, Cash would [[duet (music)|duet]] with Hiatt on his "[[The Way We Make a Broken Heart]]" produced by Mathews and Nagle.  When Geffen failed to release the single, Cash re-recorded it in 1987 and it went to No.&nbsp;1 on the US country charts.  [[Ricky Nelson|Rick Nelson]] also covered "It Hasn\'t Happened Yet" on his 1981 album \'\'Playing to Win\'\'.

Hiatt recorded a duet with Elvis Costello, a [[cover version]] of [[The Spinners (soul music)|the Spinners]]\' song, "Living A Little, Laughing A Little," which appeared on \'\'Warming Up to the Ice Age\'\'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  Shortly after its release, Bob Dylan covered Hiatt\'s song "The Usual," which had appeared on the [[soundtrack]] to the [[film]], \'\'[[Hearts of Fire]]\'\'.  However, Geffen dropped Hiatt from the label after \'\'Ice Age\'\' failed to chart.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Success (1987\xe2\x80\x931989)===
Hiatt finally came into success in 1987, when he released his first big hit, \'\'[[Bring the Family]]\'\'.  For the album, Hiatt had a backing band consisting of [[Ry Cooder]], [[Nick Lowe]], and [[Jim Keltner]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  Most of the songs on the album have since been extensively covered, especially "[[Have a Little Faith in Me]]," which has been covered by a number of artists, including [[Joe Cocker]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Mandy Moore]] and [[Bon Jovi]]; and "Memphis in the Meantime", which has been covered by [[Carl Perkins]], and Gregg Allman.  "Thank You Girl" was a moderate radio hit, but nothing that would garner Hiatt national attention, although the B-side of the single featured a non-album duet with [[Loudon Wainwright III]] on a cover of the [[Temptations]]\xe2\x80\x99 hit "My Girl" (Hiatt returned the favor on the B-side of Wainwright\'s single "Your Mother and I").  Most notably, Bonnie Raitt would bring "Thing Called Love" to No.&nbsp;11 on the U.S. charts with her 1989 release, \'\'[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]\'\'.

Following \'\'Bring the Family\'\', Hiatt had a string of nine straight studio albums hit the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]].

In 1988, he returned to the studio to record \'\'[[Slow Turning]]\'\', which would be his first album to hit the upper half of the Billboard 200.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  It also featured his only top ten chart single, the title track, which hit No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.  As well, "Tennessee Plates", would later appear in the [[Ridley Scott]] directed and [[Academy Award]] winning film, \'\'[[Thelma and Louise]]\'\' in 1991.  In 1989, [[The Jeff Healey Band]] covered the Hiatt-penned song "[[Angel Eyes (The Jeff Healey Band song)|Angel Eyes]]", and took it to the Top 5 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].

===The 1990s and beyond===
[[File:Hiatt.jpg|alt=|thumb|Hiatt solo in 2010]]
In 1992, Cooder, Keltner, and Lowe again backed up Hiatt, but this time they gave themselves a band name, [[Little Village]],<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> a reference to a [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]] project.  Expectations for the \'\'[[Little Village (album)|Little Village]]\'\' album were high, but the album failed to even chart as high as Hiatt\'s last solo album, and the group disbanded after an only moderately successful tour.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1993, Hiatt recorded \'\'[[Perfectly Good Guitar]]\'\' with members of alternative rock groups [[School of Fish]] and [[Wire Train]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Hiatt recorded the album with producer Matt Wallace, who had worked most prominently with [[Faith No More]], a band that Hiatt\'s 15-year-old son Rob had recommended for him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Renee|url=http://www.unicom.com/retired/john-hiatt/article-rh.html|title=Joys of Bust-\'em-up Rock|publisher=\'\'[[The Dallas Morning News]]\'\'|date=March 3, 1994}}</ref> It was Hiatt\'s highest peaking album at No.&nbsp;47, but again was still not the true commercial breakthrough A&M expected.

In 1993, \'\'Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt,\'\' a [[compilation album]] of covers of Hiatt\'s songs was released.  This was followed by an album of original covers \'\'Rollin\' into Memphis: Songs of John Hiatt\'\' in 2000, and a second [[compilation album]] with a few originals, \'\'It\'ll Come To You...The Songs of John Hiatt,\'\' in 2003.

In 1994, Hiatt released \'\'[[Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan?]]\'\', his first official live album and his last album with [[A&M Records]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> A CD and DVD of his performance on \'\'[[Austin City Limits]]\'\' was released in 2005. Hiatt had previously released two promotional live promotional "official bootlegs", \'\'Riot with Hiatt\'\' in 1985, and \'\'Live at the Hiatt\'\' in 1993, as well as the EP \'\'Live at the Palace\'\' in 1991.

Hiatt received his first Grammy nomination in 1995 for his album \'\'Walk On\'\'. Hiatt\'s next few albums never gained any momentum on the charts, and he saw little change in his fanbase in the late 1990s, indicating a dedicated following.  In 2000, Hiatt released his first independent album on [[Vanguard Records]], \'\'[[Crossing Muddy Waters]]\'\', which saw a heavy influence of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in his music.  Later that year, he was named songwriter/artist of the year at the Nashville Music Awards. In 2001, \'\'Crossing Muddy Waters\'\' was nominated for a Grammy Award for [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]], with [[Davey Faragher]] and [[David Immergl\xc3\xbcck]] as his only accompanists.

In 2002, Hiatt performed several songs for the soundtrack to [[Disney]]\'s \'\'[[Country Bears]]\'\' movie, representing the voice of the lead singer.  The movie also featured covers of Hiatt songs by Bonnie Raitt and [[Don Henley]].

Hiatt\'s album, \'\'[[Master of Disaster]]\'\', was released on June 21, 2005. The album was produced by [[Jim Dickinson]], and Hiatt was backed up by the bassist [[David Hood]] and several members of the [[North Mississippi Allstars]]. The album achieved modest sales, becoming a top ten independent album, but eluded significant commercial success in the same manner that his previous albums did.

On February 12, 2008, during a concert with [[Lyle Lovett]] at the National Arts Centre in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]], Hiatt said that his new album would be titled \'\'Same Old Man\'\'.  It was released on May 27, 2008.

On July 18, 2008 Hiatt performed at [[Ravinia Park]] in Highland Park, Illinois with his daughter, Lilly.

In August 2009 he appeared in [[Levon Helm\'s Ramble At The Ryman]] singing [[The Weight]] at the historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.

In March 2010, Hiatt released \'\'The Open Road.\'\'

Hiatt appears as a performer in \'\'The House of Blues\'\' in the sixth episode of the second season of [[Treme (TV series)|Treme]], with the episode title taken from his song \'\'Feels Like Rain\'\'. The episode aired May 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Dave|url=http://www.nola.com/treme-hbo/index.ssf/2011/05/treme_explained_feels_like_rai.html|title=\'Treme\' explained: \'Feels Like Rain\'|publisher=\'\'[[The Times-Picayune]]\'\'|date=May 29, 2011}}</ref>
 
Hiatt presented an Americana Lifetime Achievement Award to Bonnie Raitt on Sept. 12, 2012. The two performed "Thing Called Love" together at the ceremony.

On September 25, 2012, Hiatt released \'\'Mystic Pinball\'\', his 21st studio album.

\'\'\'Nicholas Drain "Nick" Lowe\'\'\' (born 24 March 1949) is an English singer-songwriter, musician, and producer.

Along with vocals, Lowe plays guitar, bass guitar, piano and [[harmonica]]. He is best known for his songs "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]" (a [[Billboard Hot 100|US Top 40 single]]) and "I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass" (a [[UK Singles Chart|top 10 UK hit]]), as well as his production work with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Graham Parker]], and others.

==Biography==
Lowe attended the independent [[Woodbridge School]] in [[Suffolk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://norfolk.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/the-famous-old-boys-and-girls-from-norfolk-independent-schools-october-2009-18975/ |title=Great British Life Norfolk Independent Schools. Retrieved 8 January 2012 |publisher=Norfolk.greatbritishlife.co.uk |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> He began his musical career in 1967, when he joined the band Kippington Lodge, along with his school friend [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]]. They released a few singles on the [[Parlophone]] record label as Kippington Lodge before they renamed the band [[Brinsley Schwarz]] in late 1969 and began performing [[country music|country]] and [[blues-rock]]. The group was launched by its management company Famepushers Ltd with an appearance at New York\'s Fillmore East; a planeload of British journalists were flown over by Famepushers to witness the event, but the stunt backfired and Brinsley Schwarz became a laughing stock until they established credibility on the London pub rock circuit.<ref name="No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution">{{ cite book | first= Will | last= Birch | year= 2003 | title= No Sleep Till Canvey Island: The Great Pub Rock Revolution | publisher=Virgin Books | location= London | isbn= 0-7535-0740-4 }}</ref> Lowe wrote some of his best-known compositions while a member of Brinsley Schwarz, including "[[(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]", a hit for Elvis Costello in 1979; and "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]", also in 1979, Lowe\'s single and biggest worldwide hit, co-written with bandmate [[Ian Gomm]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

After leaving Brinsley Schwarz in 1975 Lowe began playing bass in [[Rockpile]] with [[Dave Edmunds]]. In August 1976, Lowe released "[[So It Goes (Nick Lowe song)|So It Goes]]" b/w "Heart of the City", the first single on the [[Stiff Records]] [[record label|label]], where he was an in-house producer.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The single and the label were funded by a loan of \xc2\xa3400 from [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]\'s [[Lee Brilleaux]]. The label\'s first [[Extended play|EP]] was Lowe\'s 1977 four-track release \'\'[[Bowi]]\'\', apparently named in response to [[David Bowie]]\'s contemporaneous LP \'\'[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]\'\'. The joke was repeated when Lowe produced [[the Rumour]]\'s album \'\'Max\'\' as an \'answer\' to [[Fleetwood Mac]]\'s \'\'[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]\'\'. Lowe continued producing albums on Stiff and other labels. In 1977 he produced Dr. Feelgood\'s album, \'\'[[Be Seeing You]]\'\', which included "That\'s It, I Quit", written by Lowe. \'\'[[Private Practice (album)|Private Practice]]\'\', issued the next year, included "[[Milk and Alcohol]]", written by Lowe and [[Gypie Mayo]]. This song and "I Love The Sound of Breaking Glass" are the only Lowe compositions to reach the Top 10 of the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{ cite book | first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006 | title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher=Guinness World Records Limited | location= London | page= 162 | isbn= 1-904994-10-5 }}</ref>

Because the two main singers in Rockpile had [[recording contract]]s with different record labels and managers, albums were always credited to either Lowe or Edmunds, so there is only one official Rockpile album, 1980\'s \'\'[[Seconds of Pleasure]]\'\', which was not released until the waning days of the collaboration. \'\'Seconds of Pleasure\'\' featured the Lowe songs "When I Write The Book" and "Heart". However, two of the pair\'s most significant solo albums from the period, Lowe\'s \'\'[[Labour of Lust]]\'\' and Edmunds\' \'\'[[Repeat When Necessary]]\'\', were effectively Rockpile albums, as was [[Carlene Carter]]\'s Lowe-produced \'\'[[Musical Shapes]]\'\' album. Lowe\'s album Labour of Lust received a gold certification in Canada in November 1979.<ref name="musiccanada.com">http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/certification/gold-albums/page/515/</ref>

Lowe was quoted as saying that he had "escaped from the tyranny of the snare drum" in \'\'No Depression\'\', (September\xe2\x80\x93October 2001) when explaining his move away from regular pop music that would get played on mainstream radio.<ref name=NoDepression>{{cite journal|journal="No Depression"|last=Cantwell|first=David|title=His aim is true \xe2\x80\xa2 Nick Lowe has found the way to play wisdom over witticism|date=Sep\xe2\x80\x93Oct 2001|url=http://archives.nodepression.com/2001/09/his-aim-is-true/6/|accessdate=3 July 2013|quote=In this setting, Lowe says, freed from the \xe2\x80\x9ctyranny of the snare drum,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s able to sing quietly, the better to explore the deeper nooks and crannies of his mature voice.}}</ref>

Other well-known Lowe songs include "I Love The Sound of Breaking Glass", "All Men Are Liars", and "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]", co-written with [[Ian Gomm]] and originally recorded with Brinsley Schwarz for their unreleased final album "It\'s All Over Now." A re-recording of "Cruel to Be Kind" was his only US [[Top 40]] [[hit record|hit]], reaching No.&nbsp;12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1979.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1979, Lowe married country singer [[Carlene Carter]], daughter of fellow country singers [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] and [[June Carter Cash]] and stepdaughter of [[Johnny Cash]].<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years 2">{{cite book

After the demise of Rockpile, Lowe toured for a period with his band Noise To Go and later with the Cowboy Outfit, which also included the noted keyboard player [[Paul Carrack]]. Lowe was also a member of the short-lived mainly studio project [[Little Village]] with [[John Hiatt]], [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Jim Keltner]], who originally got together to record Hiatt\'s 1987 album \'\'[[Bring the Family]]\'\'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1992, "(What\'s So Funny \'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding" was [[cover version|covered]] by [[Curtis Stigers]] on the soundtrack album to \'\'[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]\'\', an album that sold about 44&nbsp;million copies world-wide.<ref name=NYTimes14Sep2011/>

A New York \'\'Daily News\'\' article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2007/06/17/2007-06-17_cruel_to_be_kind_of_old-1.html |title="Cruel to be kind of old" by Jim Farber, New York Daily News, 17 June 2007 |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=2007-06-17 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> quoted Lowe as saying his greatest fear in recent years was "sticking with what you did when you were famous." "I didn\'t want to become one of those thinning-haired, jowly old geezers who still does the same shtick they did when they were young, slim and beautiful," he said. "That\'s revolting and rather tragic." Rock critic Jim Farber observed: "Lowe\'s recent albums, epitomised by the new \'\'[[At My Age]]\'\', moved him out of the realms of ironic pop and animated rock and into the role of a worldly balladeer, specialising in grave vocals and graceful tunes. Lowe\'s four most recent solo albums mine the wealth of American roots music, drawing on vintage country, soul and R&B to create an elegant mix of his own."

In 2008, [[Yep Roc]] and [[Proper Records]] released a thirtieth anniversary edition of Lowe\'s first solo album \'\'[[Jesus of Cool]]\'\' (entitled \'\'[[Pure Pop for Now People]]\'\' in the US with a slightly different track listing). The re-issue includes tracks from the British and American releases in addition to several bonus tracks. In March 2009, he released a 49-track CD/DVD [[compilation album|compilation]] of songs spanning his entire career. Proper Records released it in the UK and Europe, entitled \'\'[[Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe]]\'\'.

In September 2010 Yep Roc issued \'\'[[The Impossible Bird]]\'\', \'\'[[Dig My Mood]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Convincer]]\'\' on vinyl for the first time, and after a one-night reunion concert with Elvis Costello in October in San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2010/12/nick-lowe-the-true-blue-basher-shows-up-for-a-friend/|title=Nick Lowe: the true blue Basher shows up for a friend |publisher=The Fortnightly Review|date=18 December 2010|accessdate=18 December 2010}}</ref>  Lowe embarked on his first non-solo United States tour "this millennium." His backing band comprised [[Geraint Watkins]] (keyboards), Robert Treherne (drums), [[Johnny Scott (musician)|Johnny Scott]] (guitar) and Matt Radford (bass). In March 2011, [[Yep Roc]] reissued Lowe\'s 1979 solo album \'\'[[Labour of Lust]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/08/nick_lowe_touri.html|title=Nick Lowe touring w/ full band, playing 4 NY shows (dates)|publisher=Brooklyn Vegan|date=30 August 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref>

Lowe played Glastonbury 2011, performing a short solo set of Brinsley Schwarz tracks on The Spirit Of 71 stage, where they played back in 1971, before heading to the Acoustic Stage for a full band show.

In September and October 2011, Lowe performed as an opening act for [[Wilco]]\'s North American tour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roffman |first=Michael |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/06/wilco-set-date-for-the-whole-love-announce-2011-tour-dates/ |title=Wilco sets date for The Whole Love, announces 2011 tour dates |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}</ref> In July 2013, he appeared and was well received at the London Hyde Park British Summer Time Festival, originally planned for a side stage, but promoted on to the main stage after headliner Elton John had to cancel. At both gigs he performed solo with acoustic guitar.

Nick Lowe was a guest on \'\'[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]\'\' in 2011 and 2013.

On 29 October 2013 Lowe released his first Christmas album, \'\'Quality Street\'\', on Yep Roc Records. He performed two songs from this album on 7 December taping of NPR\'s \'\'[[Wait Wait... Don\'t Tell Me!]]\'\'.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Personal life==
Lowe has been married twice. His first marriage to country singer Carlene Carter lasted from 1979 to 1990. He married Peta Waddington, a designer and DJ, in 2008. The couple have a son, Roy Lowe, who was born in 2005.

* \xe2\x80\x9cHalf a Boy and Half a Man\xe2\x80\x9d

===Producer===
Lowe\'s work as a producer is at least as notable as his work as a performer and songwriter.  His early \'rough and ready\' production style earned him the nickname "Basher", inspired by his supposed instructions to bands to \'bash it out\xe2\x80\x94we\'ll tart it up later\'.  Beginning with his tenure at Stiff Records as an in-house producer in 1976, Lowe was responsible for producing some of the benchmark releases of punk and new wave, including [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]\'s first single, "[[New Rose]]", considered the first English punk single, as well as the group\'s debut album, \'\'[[Damned Damned Damned]]\'\'.  He also produced [[Elvis Costello]]\'s first five albums from 1977-1981, including \'\'[[My Aim Is True]]\'\', \'\'[[This Year\'s Model]]\'\', and \'\'[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]\'\', which spun off numerous UK hit singles.  Other Stiff acts produced by Lowe included punk parody group [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]], new wave icon [[Wreckless Eric]] and roots rocker [[Mickey Jupp]].

Other clients (both before and after Lowe left Stiff in 1978) included: [[The Pretenders]] (the 1978 debut single "Stop Your Sobbing", which was a modest UK and US hit); Graham Parker (his well-received first and third albums); [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] (several LPs, and their biggest hit single, 1979\'s "[[Milk and Alcohol]]"); [[Johnny Cash]] (his 1980 single "Without Love", a minor hit on the US and Canadian country charts); and his then-wife [[Carlene Carter]] (2 albums in 1980 and 1981).

From \'82-\'85, he produced material for [[Paul Carrack]], [[John Hiatt]], [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] and [[The Men They Couldn\'t Hang]].  Beginning in the mid-80s, Lowe became more selective in his choice of outside production tasks, helming the 1986 LP \'\'[[Blood & Chocolate]]\'\' for Elvis Costello, a 1988 single ("Windows of the World" b/w "1969") for the Pretenders, and the [[Katydids (band)|Katydids]] self-titled debut album of 1990.  After that, Lowe essentially retired from producing recordings for other acts, although country-rock band [[The Mavericks]] persuaded him to produce one track for the \'\'Apollo 13\'\' soundtrack in 1995.

==Influence==
In 2011 \'\'The New York Times\'\' claimed "The 40-year career of the English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe constitutes a paradox: the songs he has written are better known than he is."<ref name="NYTimes14Sep2011" />

[[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], of the [[Arctic Monkeys]], said that he is \'blown away\' and \'back to square one\' by Lowe\'s songwriting<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itsoktolikenicklowe.com/arctic-monkeys-give-props-to-nick |title=The Arctic Monkeys\xe2\x80\x99 Alex Turner gives props to Nick &#124; It\'s OK to Like Nick Lowe |publisher=Itsoktolikenicklowe.com |date=2011-07-08 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

[[Wilco]] covered the Nick Lowe song "I Love My Label" as the b-side to "I Might" on their own dBpm label. Nick Lowe toured with Wilco for their album [[The Whole Love]] and would make guest appearances on his "[[Cruel to Be Kind]]" and (along with [[Mavis Staples]]) appeared onstage for a cover of [[The Band]] song "[[The Weight]]." Jeff Tweedy would state on stage that Lowe is "our hero."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc2RZ-dk0t4 |title=Wilco (with Nick Lowe) encore @ Roundhouse, October 29th 2011 |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>

\'\'\'Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen\'\'\' (born September 23, 1949) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], [[guitarist]] and [[humanitarian]]. He is best known for his work with his [[E Street Band]]. Nicknamed "The Boss", Springsteen is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, [[Americana (music)|Americana]] [[working class]], sometimes political sentiments centered on his native [[New Jersey]] and his lengthy and energetic stage performances, with concerts from the 1970s to the present decade running over three hours in length.

Springsteen\'s recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, \'\'[[Born in the U.S.A.]]\'\' and \'\'[[Born to Run]]\'\', showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life; he has sold more than 64 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\'s best-selling artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists |title=Top Selling Artists - December 04, 2013 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/springsteen-has-high-hopes-for-radical-marketing-wheeze-1.1649595|title=Springsteen has high hopes for radical marketing wheeze|publisher=[[The Irish Times]]|date=January 10, 2014|accessdate=February 19, 2014|last=Boyd|first=Brian}}</ref> He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 [[Grammy Awards]], two [[Golden Globes]] and an [[Academy Award]] as well as being inducted into both the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

==Early life==
Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, at [[Monmouth Medical Center]] in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cross |first=Charles R. |title=Backstreets: Springsteen \xe2\x80\x93 the man and his music |publisher=Harmony Books |year=1992 |page=40 |isbn=0-517-58929-X}}</ref> He was brought home from the hospital to [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey|Freehold Borough]] where he spent his childhood. He lived on South Street and attended [[Freehold High School|Freehold Borough High School]]. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry and worked as a bus driver, among other vocations, although he was mostly unemployed. Springsteen has said his mother, Adele Ann (n\xc3\xa9e Zerilli), was the main breadwinner.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gavin |last=Martin |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/why-bruce-springsteen-is-still-attacking-the-fat-741848 |title=Why Bruce Springsteen is still attacking the \'fat bankers\' and \'robber barons\' |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}</ref> His mother was a legal secretary and was of [[Italian American|Italian]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niaf.org/research/contribution.asp|title=Italian American Contributions|accessdate=June 21, 2013|publisher=National Italian American Foundation}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> His maternal grandfather was born in [[Vico Equense]], a town near [[Naples]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Di Marzio |first=Stefano |url=http://www.rollingstonemagazine.it/musica/news-musica/springsteen-tu-vuo-fa-o-napoletano/ |title=Bruce Springsteen, tu vu\xc3\xb2 fa o napoletano |work=Rolling Stone |language=Italian |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 3, 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. [[Pamela Springsteen|Pamela]] had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full-time; she took photos for his \'\'[[Human Touch]]\'\', \'\'[[Lucky Town]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]\'\' albums.

Raised a Roman Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns and rejected the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and included a few rock-influenced, traditional [[Irish-Catholic]] hymns.<ref name="glorydays">\'\'Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s\'\'. Dave Marsh, 1987, pg. 88\xe2\x80\x9389.</ref> In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He noted in the interview that his faith had given him a "very active spiritual life," although he joked that this "made it very difficult sexually." He added: "Once a Catholic, always a Catholic."<ref>Editors, "Boss Talk", \'\'The Tablet\'\', 25 February 2012.</ref>

In ninth grade, he transferred to the public [[Freehold High School|Freehold Regional High School]], but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he was a "loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar." He completed high school, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own graduation ceremony.<ref>\'\'Springsteen\'\'. Robert Hilburn, 1985, p. 28.</ref> He briefly attended [[Ocean County College]], but dropped out.<ref name="glorydays" />

}}
Springsteen had been inspired to take up music at the age of seven after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\' in 1956 and growing up hearing fellow New Jersey singer, [[Frank Sinatra]], on the radio. Sinatra also inspired Springsteen\'s style of songwriting, which was developed in his youth after his mother bought him his first guitar for $18. 1964 was also important for Springsteen, having seen The Beatles\' appearance on \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\'.<ref name=Crandall /> Thereafter he started playing for audiences, first at a trailer park on [[New Jersey Route 34]] and then at a local [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodge]]. In 1965, Springsteen\'s mother took out a loan to buy her 16-year-old son a $60 Kent guitar, an act he subsequently memorialized in his song "The Wish".

In the same year, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently the lead singer of The Castiles. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in [[Brick Township, New Jersey|Brick Township]] and played a variety of venues, including [[Cafe Wha?]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. Marion Vinyard has said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newstranscript.gmnews.com/news/2002/0417/Front_page/003.html|title=Musicians\' best friends to be honored in Freehold|work=News Transcript|location=New Jersey| date= 17 April 2002|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref>

Called for [[Conscription in the United States|induction]] when he was 18, Springsteen failed his physical examination and did not serve in Vietnam. In an interview in \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine in 1984, he said, "When I got on the bus to go take my physical, I thought one thing: I ain\'t goin\'." He had suffered a concussion in a motorcycle accident when he was 17, and this together with his "crazy" behavior at induction and not taking the tests was enough to get him a [[Class 1-A|4F]].<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=April 21, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090421085029/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5933449|title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Bruce Springsteen|last= Loder |first= Kurt|date=6 December 1984 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate= March 21, 2010| deadurl= yes| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/5933449 }}</ref>

In the late 1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a [[power trio]] known as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey. Springsteen acquired the nickname "The Boss" during this period as when he played club gigs with a band he took on the task of collecting the band\'s nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.<ref name=bbc-nicknames>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7829013.stm|title=What\'s in a nickname?|last= Brett |first= Oliver|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=January 21, 2009|date=January 15, 2009}}</ref> The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of [[Monopoly (board game)|Monopoly]] that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians.<ref>{{cite news|last1= Marchand| first1= Francois| title= Review: Bruce Springsteen rocks like a boss in Vancouver| url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/Review+Bruce+Springsteen+rocks+like+boss+Vancouver/7612975/story.html|accessdate=7 September 2014|work=Vancouver Sun|date=29 November 2012}}</ref> Springsteen is not fond of this nickname, due to his dislike of bosses,<ref name=bbc-nicknames/> but seems to have since given it a tacit acceptance. Previously he had the nickname "Doctor".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Backstage With Bruce: Springsteen On His Early Work |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100038036 |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2009 |origyear=November 15, 2005 |accessdate=February 2, 2009}}</ref>

[[File:Beach tickets.JPG||thumb|New Jersey beach towns such as [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] inspired the themes of ordinary life in Bruce Springsteen\'s music.]]
From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with [[Steel Mill]], which also featured [[Danny Federici]], [[Vini Lopez]], [[Vinnie Roslin]] and later [[Steve Van Zandt]] and [[Robbin Thompson]]. They went on to play the mid-Atlantic college circuit, and also briefly in California. In January 1970 well-known \'\'[[San Francisco Examiner]]\'\' music critic Philip Elwood gave Springsteen credibility in his glowing assessment of Steel Mill: "I have never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent." Elwood went on to praise their "cohesive musicality" and, in particular, singled out Springsteen as "a most impressive composer". During this time Springsteen also performed regularly at small clubs in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]];<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dolloff|first1=Matt|title=40 Years Ago: Bruce Springsteen Gives Boston a Glimpse of a Rising Star|url=http://wzlx.cbslocal.com/2014/04/16/40-years-ago-bruce-springsteen-gives-boston-a-glimpse-of-a-budding-star/|website=100.7 WZLX| accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia]];<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Boss Growing Up in Richmond|url=http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/com/id/7779/rec/36 work=[The Commonwealth Times, |date=August 29 - May 5, 1986.}}</ref> and Asbury Park and other points along the [[Jersey Shore]], quickly gathering a cult following.

Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style: Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early- to mid-1971), Sundance Blues Band (mid-1971), and the Bruce Springsteen Band (mid-1971 to mid-1972).  With the addition of pianist [[David Sancious]], the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horn sections, "The Zoomettes" (a group of female backing vocalists for "Dr. Zoom") and [[Southside Johnny Lyon]] on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock \'n\' roll, and soul. His prolific songwriting ability, with "More words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums", as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns, brought his skill to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: new managers [[Mike Appel]] and Jim Cretecos, and [[Columbia Records]] talent scout [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who, under Appel\'s pressure, auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.

Even after Springsteen gained international acclaim, his New Jersey roots showed through in his music, and he often praised "the great state of New Jersey" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey, [[Philadelphia]] and New York venues. He also made many surprise appearances at [[The Stone Pony]] and other shore nightclubs over the years, becoming the foremost exponent of the [[Jersey Shore sound]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}<!-- the whole paragraph -->

===1972\xe2\x80\x931974: Initial struggle for success===
Springsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972 with the help of John Hammond, who had signed [[Bob Dylan]] to the same label a decade earlier. Springsteen brought many of his New Jersey\xe2\x80\x93based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named as such for several more years). His debut album \'\'[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]\'\', released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite<ref>{{cite web|first=Lester|last=Bangs|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/107193/greetings_from_asbury_park_nj|title=Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ|date=July 5, 1973|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=March 21, 2010|authorlink=Lester Bangs|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080919090512/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/107193/greetings_from_asbury_park_nj|archivedate=September 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> though sales were slow.

Because of Springsteen\'s lyrical poeticism and [[folk rock]]\xe2\x80\x93rooted music exemplified on tracks like "[[Blinded by the Light]]"<ref group=note>"[[Blinded by the Light]]" would later be a hit for [[Manfred Mann]] and reach No. 1, making it the only time Springsteen had a No. 1 single as a songwriter.</ref> and "[[For You (Bruce Springsteen song)|For You]]", as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to [[Bob Dylan]]. "He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven\'t heard since I was rocked by \'[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\'" wrote \'\'[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]\'\' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]] in Springsteen\'s first interview/profile in March 1973.

In September 1973 his second album \'\'[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]\'\' was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen\'s songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folky, more R&B vibe, and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. "[[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)]]" and "Incident on 57th Street" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing "[[Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)]]" continues to rank among Springsteen\'s most beloved concert numbers.

In the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston\'s \'\'[[The Real Paper]]\'\' music critic [[Jon Landau]] wrote, after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, "I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time."<ref>{{cite news|last=Landau |first=Jon|date=May 22, 1974|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20057685_20057687_20152218,00.html|title=Growing Young With Rock and Roll|work=[[The Real Paper]]|accessdate=March 21, 2010|authorlink=Jon Landau}}</ref> Landau subsequently became Springsteen\'s [[Talent manager|manager]] and producer, helping to finish the epic new album \'\'[[Born to Run]]\'\'. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a "[[Wall of Sound]]" production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of "[[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]" to [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock radio]], anticipation built toward the album\'s release.

The album took more than 14 months to record, with six months alone spent on the song "Born To Run". During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard "sounds in [his] head" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during these recording sessions that "Miami" [[Steve Van Zandt]] would stumble into the studio just in time to help Springsteen organize the horn section on "[[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out]]". Van Zandt, who would eventually join the E Street Band, had been a long-time friend of Springsteen, as well as a collaborator on earlier musical projects, and understood where he was coming from, which helped him to translate some of the sounds Springsteen was hearing. Still, by the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was not satisfied, and upon first hearing the finished album, threw the record into the alley and told Jon Landau he would rather just cut the album live at The [[Bottom Line]] (a place he often played).<ref>{{cite book| authorlink= Dave Marsh |last= Marsh |first= Dave |title= Bruce Springsteen: Two Hearts: The Definitive Biography, 1972\xe2\x80\x932003 |publisher= Routledge |year= 2003 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=sLJZ84jaxhsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=bruce+springsteen&hl=en&ei=AAdjTvzNGujo0QG-rYmfCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bottom%20line&f=false |pages= 14, 203, etc.|isbn= 0-415-96928-X}}</ref>

===1975\xe2\x80\x931983: Breakthrough===
On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York\'s [[Bottom Line]] club. The engagement attracted major media attention and was broadcast live on [[WNEW-FM]]. (Decades later, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.)<ref>{{cite web |date= June 24, 2004| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071204181514/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/|archivedate= December 4, 2007|title=The Moments|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Oklahoma City rock radio station [[WKY]], in association with Carson Attractions, staged an experimental promotional event that resulted in a sold out house at the (6,000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall.  With the release of \'\'Born to Run\'\' on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success. The album peaked at No. 3 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], and while reception at US top 40 radio outlets for the album\'s two singles was not overwhelming ("Born to Run" reached a modest No. 23 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' charts, and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" peaked at #83), almost every track on the album received [[album-oriented rock]] airplay, especially "Born to Run", "[[Thunder Road (song)|Thunder Road]]", "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" and "[[Jungleland]]", all of which remain perennial favorites on many [[classic rock]] stations.

With its panoramic imagery, thundering production and desperate optimism, \'\'Born to Run\'\' is considered to be among the best rock and roll albums of all time and Springsteen\'s finest work. Springsteen appeared on the covers of both \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\' and \'\'[[Newsweek]]\'\' in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that Springsteen eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a [[Hammersmith Odeon London \'75|concert appearance in London]].

A legal battle with former manager [[Mike Appel]] kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through [[Born to Run tours|extensive touring across the U.S.]] Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, his new songs had taken a more somber tone than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced \'\'[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]\'\' (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen\'s career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; now the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen\'s growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country [[Darkness Tour|1978 tour]] to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/05/faux_americana.single.html|title=Faux Americana, Why I still love Bruce Springsteen.| last= Metcalf| first= Stephen| date= 2 May 2005| work= Slate| accessdate= October 30, 2013}}</ref>

By the late 1970s, Bruce Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. [[Manfred Mann\'s Earth Band]] had achieved a US No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of \'\'Greetings\'\'{{\'}} "[[Blinded by the Light]]" in early 1977. [[Patti Smith]] reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen\'s unreleased "[[Because the Night]]" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, while [[The Pointer Sisters]] hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen\'s also unreleased "[[Fire (Springsteen song)|Fire]]". Although not a critical success, long time friend [[Southside Johnny]] recorded "[[The Fever (Bruce Springsteen song)|The Fever]]" in early 1976, "[[Talk to Me (Bruce Springsteen song)|Talk to Me]]" in 1978, both contributions from Springsteen. The two of them along with [[Steve Van Zandt]] collaborated to produce "[[Hearts of Stone (album)|Trapped Again]]" in 1978.

In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear power]] collective at [[Madison Square Garden]] for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent \'\'[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]\'\' live album, as well as the following summer\'s \'\'[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]\'\' documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen\'s fabled live act, as well as Springsteen\'s first tentative dip into political involvement.

Springsteen continued to consolidate his thematic focus on working-class life with the 20-song double album \'\'[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]\'\' in 1980, which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, "[[Hungry Heart]]". Like the previous two albums, musical styles on \'\'The River\'\' were derived largely from rock music of the Fifties and Sixties, but with a more explicit pop-rock sound than earlier albums. This is apparent in the stylistic adoption of Eighties pop-rock hallmarks like the reverberating-tenor drums, very basic percussion/guitar and repetitive lyrics apparent in many of the tracks. The title song pointed to Springsteen\'s intellectual direction, while a couple of the lesser-known tracks presaged his musical direction. The album sold well, becoming his first topper on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and a [[The River Tour|long tour in 1980 and 1981]] followed, featuring Springsteen\'s first extended playing of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.

\'\'The River\'\' was followed in 1982 by the stark solo [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] \'\'[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]\'\'. Recording sessions had been held to expand on a demo tape Springsteen had made at his home on a simple, low-tech four-track tape deck. However during the recording process Springsteen and producer [[Jon Landau]] realized the songs worked better as solo acoustic numbers than full band renditions and the original demo tape was released as the album. Although the recordings of the E Street Band were shelved, other songs from these sessions would later be released, including "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" and "[[Glory Days (song)|Glory Days]]". According to the [[Dave Marsh|Marsh]] biographies, Springsteen was in a depressed state when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While \'\'Nebraska\'\' did not sell as well as Springsteen\'s three previous albums, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named "Album of the Year" by \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine\'s critics) and influenced later significant works by other major artists, including [[U2]]\'s album \'\'[[The Joshua Tree]]\'\'. It helped inspire the musical genre known as [[lo-fi music]], becoming a cult favorite among [[indie rock|indie-rockers]]. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with \'\'Nebraska\'\'\'s release.

===1984\xe2\x80\x931991: Commercial and popular phenomenon===
Springsteen is probably best known for his album \'\'[[Born in the U.S.A.]]\'\' (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S., 30 million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. <!--[save for tour article] The band played Europe for the third time, starting in Slane Castle, Dublin, Ireland, before 80,000 fans and concluding before 113,000 fans at Leeds\' Roundhay Park. --> The [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|title track]] was a bitter commentary on the treatment of [[Vietnam veteran]]s, some of whom were Springsteen\'s friends and bandmates. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics\xe2\x80\x94except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.<ref>Guterman, Jimmy. \'\'Runaway American Dream\'\', Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2005. 153.</ref>

The song was widely misinterpreted as [[jingoism|jingoistic]], and in connection with the [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential campaign]] became the [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)#Political reactions|subject of considerable folklore]]. In 1984, conservative columnist [[George Will]] attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen\'s work ethic. Six days after the column was printed, in a campaign rally in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], Reagan said, "America\xe2\x80\x99s future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire\xe2\x80\x94New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s own, Bruce Springsteen.\xe2\x80\x9d Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, "Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must\xe2\x80\x99ve been, you know? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was the Nebraska album. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s been listening to this one." He then began playing Johnny 99, with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Marc|title=How Ronald Reagan Changed Bruce Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s Politics|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448.html#.U9WrPYBdXMd|accessdate=July 28, 2014|publisher=Politico|date=April 6, 2014}}</ref>

Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] to use the song in a car commercial. In later years, to eliminate the bombast and make the song\'s original meaning more explicitly clear, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only by acoustic guitar, thus returning to how the song was originally conceived. The original acoustic version of the song, recorded in 1982 during the \'\'[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]\'\' sessions appeared on the 1998 archival release \'\'[[Tracks (Bruce Springsteen album)|Tracks]]\'\'.

"[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]" was the biggest of seven hit singles from \'\'Born in the U.S.A.\'\', peaking at No. 2 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' music charts. The music video for the song featured a young [[Courteney Cox]] dancing on stage with Springsteen, an appearance which helped kickstart the actress\'s career. The song "[[Cover Me (song)|Cover Me]]" was written by Springsteen for [[Donna Summer]], but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer\'s work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, "[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]". Videos for the album were made by noted film directors [[Brian De Palma]] and [[John Sayles]]. Springsteen was featured on the "[[We Are the World]]" song and [[We Are the World (album)|album]] in 1985. His live single "Trapped" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT52&dq=billboard+1985&hl=en&ei=MQlaTcPLA4nUgAeQg8HdDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=billboard%201985&f=false |title=Billboard |publisher=Google Books |date=May 11, 1985 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

During the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], Springsteen met actress [[Julianne Phillips]], whom he would marry in 1985. He also that year took part in the recording of the [[USA For Africa]] charity song "We Are The World"; however he did turn down playing at [[Live Aid]] He later stated that he "simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be". He has since expressed regret at turning down [[Bob Geldof]]\'s invitation stating that he could have played a couple of acoustic songs had there been no slot available for a full band performance.

The \'\'Born in the U.S.A.\'\' period represented the height of Springsteen\'s visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience demographic he would ever reach (aided by the release of [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]\'s [[remix|dance mixes]] of three of the singles). \'\'[[Live/1975\xe2\x80\x9385]]\'\', a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. \'\'Live/1975\xe2\x80\x9385\'\' summed up Springsteen\'s career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen\'s difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long [[coda (music)|coda]] to "[[Racing in the Street]]". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album\'s song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent [[bootleg recording]] and trading among fans.

During the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including \'\'[[Backstreets Magazine|Backstreets]]\'\' magazine, which started in Seattle and continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen\'s management and official website.

After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative \'\'[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]\'\' album (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his marriage to Julianne Phillips and described some of his unhappinesses in the relationship. Reflecting the challenges of love in "[[Brilliant Disguise]]", Springsteen sang:

{{cquote|I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow/I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow/ Well I\'ve tried so hard baby, but I just can\'t see/ What a woman like you is doing with me.}}

The subsequent [[Tunnel of Love Express Tour]] shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements. During the European leg in 1988, Springsteen\'s relationship with backup singer [[Patti Scialfa]] became public. Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 21, 2008| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucespringsteen/biography|title=Bruce Springsteen biography|work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216160647/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/brucespringsteen/biography|archivedate=February 16, 2008}}</ref>

On July 19, 1988, Springsteen held a [[Berlin Wall#Rocking the Wall-Bruce Springsteen Visit|concert in East Germany]] that attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum has called the concert "the most important rock concert ever, anywhere," in his 2013 book \'\'Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World\'\'. It had been conceived by the Communist Party\'s youth arm in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum\'s opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in the DDR, and helped contribute to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] the following year.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Der Spiegel|last=Crossland|first=David|title=Chimes of Freedom: How Springsteen Helped Tear Down the Wall

Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide [[Human Rights Now!]] tour for Amnesty International. In late 1989 he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California, marrying in 1991.

===1992\xe2\x80\x931998: Artistic and commercial ups and downs and soundtrack work===
In 1992, after risking fan accusations of "going Hollywood" by moving to [[Los Angeles]] (a radical move for someone so linked to the blue-collar life of the Jersey Shore) and working with [[session musician]]s, Springsteen released two albums at once. \'\'[[Human Touch]]\'\' and \'\'[[Lucky Town]]\'\' were even more introspective than any of his previous work and displayed a newly revealed confidence. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the \'\'Lucky Town\'\' album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.

An electric band appearance on the acoustic \'\'[[MTV Unplugged]]\'\' television program (later released as \'\'[[In Concert/MTV Plugged]]\'\') was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] acceptance speech:

{{cquote|I\'ve gotta thank him because\xe2\x80\x94what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs\xe2\x80\x94and I tried it in the early \'90s and it didn\'t work; the public didn\'t like it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loose-ends.it/halloffame.html| title=Bruce Springsteen\'s Speech After Being Inducted into the Rock \'n Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>}}

A multiple [[Grammy Award]] winner, Springsteen also won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1994 for his song "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film \'\'[[Philadelphia (movie)|Philadelphia]]\'\'. The music video for the song shows Springsteen\'s actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the "[[Brilliant Disguise#Video|Brilliant Disguise]]" video.

In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary \'\'[[Blood Brothers (1996 film)|Blood Brothers]]\'\'), he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, \'\'[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]\'\', inspired by [[John Steinbeck]]\'s \'\'[[The Grapes of Wrath]]\'\' and by \'\'Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass\'\', a book by Pulitzer Prize-winners author [[Dale Maharidge]] and photographer [[Michael Williamson (photographer)|Michael Williamson]]. This was generally less well-received than the similar \'\'Nebraska\'\', due to the minimal [[melody]], twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic [[Ghost of Tom Joad Tour]] that followed successfully featured many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap during the performances.

In April 1996, Springsteen gave a very forward-looking interview to \'\'[[The Advocate]]\'\' LGBT magazine\'s Judy Wieder, in which he spoke of the importance of fighting for gay marriage. "You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It\'s part of your place in society, and in some way part of society\'s acceptance of you." It seemed like a natural extension of the support that began with his 1994 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]" which showed the saga of a dying gay man struggling with AIDS.<ref name="Wieder1995">{{cite web|last=Wieder|first=Judy|url=http://www.brucespringsteen.hu/docs/1995advocate.doc|format=doc|title=Bruce Springsteen: The Advocate Interview|work=The Advocate|publisher=brucespringsteen.hu|year=1995|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref>

Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002987-2,00.html|title=Bruce Rising|accessdate=March 23, 2008|last1=Tyrangiel|first1=Josh|first2= Kate |last2= Carcaterra|date=August 5, 2002|work=Time|pages=2 of 6}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> In 1998, Springsteen released the sprawling, four-disc [[box set]] of [[out-take]]s, \'\'[[Tracks (Bruce Springsteen album)|Tracks]]\'\'.

[[Image:RisingTourGiantsStadiumLot.jpg|thumb|The scene outside the [[Giants Stadium]] parking lot for banner-marked, record-setting, 10-night stand of [[The Rising Tour]] during July 2003.]]

Springsteen was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1999 by [[Bono]] of [[U2]], a favor he returned in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/springsteen-to-induct-u2-into-hall-of-fame-20050225 | title=Springsteen to Induct U2 Into Hall of Fame | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=February 25, 2005 | accessdate=March 18, 2015 | author=Mar, Alex}}</ref>

In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at [[Izod Center|Continental Airlines Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City\'s [[Madison Square Garden]], which ended the tour. The final two shows were recorded for [[HBO]], with corresponding DVD and album releases as \'\'[[Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City]]\'\'. A new song, "[[American Skin (41 Shots)]]", about the police shooting of [[Amadou Diallo]], which was played at these shows proved controversial.

In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, \'\'[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]\'\', produced by [[Brendan O\'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O\'Brien]]. The album, mostly a reflection on the [[September 11 attacks]], was a critical and popular success. (Many of the songs were influenced by phone conversations Springsteen had with family members of victims of the attacks who in their obituaries had mentioned how his music touched their lives.) [[The Rising (Bruce Springsteen song)|The title track]] gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen\'s best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on \'\'[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]\'\', [[The Rising Tour]] commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. because of his vocal endorsement of leftist, liberal politics. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn|date=September 16, 2003|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478248/20030916/story.jhtml|title=Springsteen Is Box-Office Boss With Projected $120M Gross|publisher=MTV}}</ref> During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Springsteen-oriented [[Internet forums|online communities]] had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour came to a final conclusion with three nights in [[Shea Stadium]], highlighted by renewed controversy over "American Skin" and a guest appearance by [[Bob Dylan]].

During the early 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations, and causes. These shows were explicitly intended for the devoted fans, featuring numbers such as the \'\'E Street Shuffle\'\' outtake "Thundercrack", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even go so far as to stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song "[[My City of Ruins]]" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for the [[America: A Tribute to Heroes]] telethon broadcast, he selected "My City of Ruins", which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the broadcast, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to "Rise up!" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close \'\'The Rising\'\' album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.

At the [[Grammy Awards of 2003]], Springsteen performed [[The Clash]]\'s "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]" along with [[Elvis Costello]], [[Dave Grohl]], and E Street Band member [[Steven Van Zandt]] and [[No Doubt]]\'s bassist, [[Tony Kanal]], in tribute to [[Joe Strummer]]; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double \'\'The River\'\' and the triple \'\'[[Sandinista!]]\'\'. In 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the [[Vote for Change]] tour, along with [[John Mellencamp]], [[John Fogerty]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], the [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Jackson Browne]], and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in [[swing state]]s, to benefit the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] political organization group [[America Coming Together]] and to encourage people to register and vote. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94against [[Musicians United for Safe Energy|nuclear energy]], for [[Vietnam veteran]]s, Amnesty International, and the [[Christic Institute]]\xe2\x80\x94he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of [[Walter Mondale]] to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan "Born in the U.S.A." flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen\'s "No Surrender" became the main campaign theme song for [[John Kerry]]\'s [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|unsuccessful presidential campaign]]; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies.

\'\'[[Devils & Dust]]\'\' was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as \'\'Nebraska\'\' and \'\'The Ghost of Tom Joad\'\' although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, with a few having been performed then but not released.<ref>{{cite news |last=McShane |first=Larry |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=505843 |title=New Springsteen Album Due in April |publisher=ABC News |agency=Associated Press |date=February 16, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050411150147/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=505843 |archivedate=April 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> The [[Devils & Dust (song)|title track]] concerns an ordinary soldier\'s feelings and fears during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]. [[Starbucks]] rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen\'s anti-corporate politics. The album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo [[Devils & Dust Tour]] at the same time as the album\'s release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, [[electric piano]], [[pump organ]], [[autoharp]], [[ukulele]], [[banjo]], electric guitar, and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar, and percussion were also used for some songs.)

In November 2005, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station called [[E Street Radio]]. This channel featured commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.

In April 2006, Springsteen released \'\'[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]\'\', an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of [[Pete Seeger]]. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and [[The Miami Horns]] from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. A [[Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour|tour]] began the same month, featuring the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed The Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to [[The Sessions Band]]). \'\'Seeger Sessions\'\' material was heavily featured, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1774131,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=A runaway American dream|first=Sarfraz|last=Manzoor|date=May 14, 2006|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/concerts/s/springsteen-bruce-060531.shtml|title=Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Sessions Band \xe2\x80\x93 PopMatters Concert Review|work=PopMatters|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Tianen |first=Dave |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=436152 |title=Born to strum |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=June 15, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061118060401/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=436152 |archivedate=November 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-springsteen-review-story,1,5443206.story?coll=chi-homepagenews-utl|title=Chicago Tribune|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. \'\'[[Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin]]\'\', containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the [[The Point Theatre|Point Theatre]] in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.

Springsteen\'s next album, titled \'\'[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]]\'\', was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it featured 10 new Springsteen songs plus "[[Long Walk Home]]", performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), "[[Terry\'s Song]]", a tribute to Springsteen\'s long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007.<ref name="back">[http://www.backstreets.com/news.html "Terry Magovern, Rest in Peace"], Backstreets.com, August 1, 2007.

It was announced on November 21, 2007, that Springsteen\'s longtime friend and founding E Street Band member, [[Danny Federici]], would be taking a leave of absence from the \'\'Magic Tour\'\' to pursue treatment for [[melanoma]]. [[Charles Giordano]] filled in as Federici\'s replacement.

Springsteen was among the recipients of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], an annual award to figures from the world of arts for their contribution to American culture, in December 2009.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8398675.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Obama honours Bruce Springsteen|date=December 7, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> President Obama gave a speech in which he talked about how Springsteen has incorporated the life of regular Americans in his expansive palette of songs and how his concerts are beyond the typical rock-and-roll concerts, how, apart from being high-energy concerts, they are "communions". He ended the remark "while I am the president, he is the Boss". Tributes were paid by several well-known celebrities including [[Jon Stewart]] (who described Springsteen\'s "unprecedented combination of lyrical eloquence, musical mastery and sheer unbridled, unadulterated joy"). A musical tribute featured [[John Mellencamp]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Jennifer Nettles]], [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[Eddie Vedder]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].

In September 2010, a documentary about the making of Springsteen\'s 1978 album \'\'Darkness on the Edge of Town\'\' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. The film, \'\'The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town\'\', was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled \'\'The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story\'\', released in November 2010.  Also airing on [[HBO]], the documentary explored Springsteen\'s making of the album and his role in the production and development of the tracks.

[[Clarence Clemons]], the E Street Band\'s saxophonist and founding member, died on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. "Clarence lived a wonderful life," Springsteen said in a statement. "He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family.

Following the release of the album, Springsteen and the E Street Band announced plans for the [[Wrecking Ball Tour]], which began on March 18, 2012. As tickets for the first U.S. dates went on sale, many fans were unable to obtain tickets, much like for the 2009 [[Working on a Dream Tour]], allegedly due to a heavy volume of [[ticket scalper]]s. Shows sold out within minutes and many tickets appeared, at much higher prices, on resale websites such as [[StubHub]] less than an hour after the onsale time. [[Ticketmaster]] said web traffic was 2.5 times the highest level of the past year during the online sales and suggested that scalpers played a big role.

On July 31, 2012, in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], Springsteen performed his longest concert ever at 4 hours and 6 minutes and 33 songs. Not included in this total time is a thirty-minute, five-song, solo acoustical set he did about two hours prior to the beginning of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2012/from-the-road-helsinki|title=From the road: Helsinki|publisher=Brucespringsteen.net|date=July 31, 2012|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref>

Springsteen was honored with the 2013 [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] award in recognition of his creative accomplishments as well as his charitable work and philanthropic activities.

On October 29, 2012, the New Jersey area was hit hard by [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Two days following the storm, Springsteen dedicated his performance at the [[Blue Cross Arena]] in [[Rochester, New York]], to those affected by the storm and those helping to recover.

==Musical style==
[[File:Kennedy Center honorees 2009 WhiteHouse Photo.jpg|thumb|Bruce Springsteen (second from right) was among the five recipients of the 2009 [[Kennedy Center Honors]]]]

Bruce Springsteen draws on many musical influences from the reservoir of traditional American popular music, [[Folk music|folk]], [[blues]] and [[Country music|country]]. From the beginning, rock and roll has been a dominant influence and Springsteen\'s musical and lyrical evocations, as well as public tributes, of artists such as Dylan, Presley, [[Roy Orbison]], [[Gary "U.S." Bonds]], and many others helped to rekindle interest in their music. Springsteen\'s other preferred musical style is American folk, evident on his debut album, \'\'[[Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey]]\'\', and more strongly on \'\'Nebraska\'\' and \'\'The Ghost of Tom Joad\'\'. Springsteen songs such as "This Hard Land" demonstrate the lyrical and musical influence of [[Woody Guthrie]].

Elements of Latin American music, jazz, soul, and funk influences can be heard on Springsteen\'s second album, \'\'[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]\'\'; the song "New York City Serenade" is even reminiscent of the music of [[George Gershwin]]. These two records prominently featured pianist [[David Sancious]], who left the band shortly into the recording of Springsteen\'s third album, \'\'[[Born To Run]]\'\'. This album, however, also emphasized the piano, the responsibility now of [[Roy Bittan]].

Subsequently in his career, Springsteen focused more on the rock elements of his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed \'\'[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]\'\' just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for the simple riffs, rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song structures are dominant. His music has been categorized as [[heartland rock]], a style typified by Springsteen, [[John Fogerty]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Bob Seger]], and [[John Mellencamp]]. This music has a lyrical reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen\'s hit album \'\'Born in the U.S.A.\'\', [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|the title song]] of which has a constantly repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These sounds fit with Springsteen\'s voice: it cries to the listener the unsentimental story of a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some chart success, such as "[[My Hometown]]" and "[[I\'m on Fire]]", in which the drum line is formed from subtle [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] and rim-clicks-shock (shock at the edge of the [[snare drum]]) accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen\'s soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as "Cadillac Ranch" showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these. Another clear influence of early rock n roll on Springsteen\'s music is evident on the song "Light of Day".{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}<!-- the whole paragraph -->

In recent years, Springsteen has changed his music further. There are more folk elements up to the gospel to be heard. His last solo album, \'\'[[Devils and Dust]]\'\', drew rave reviews not only for Springsteen\'s complex songwriting, but also for his expressive and sensitive singing.

On the album \'\'[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]\'\' Springsteen performed folk classics with a folk band, rather than his usual E Street Band. On his ensuing tour he also interpreted some of his own rock songs in a folk style.

His 2012 album, \'\'[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]\'\', incorporated a variety of styles.

Often described as cinematographic in their scope, Springsteen\'s lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of every day situations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jun/22/popandrock.culture4|title=Bruce almighty, Elizabeth Wurtzel on Bruce Springsteen\'s lyrics|work=The Guardian|date=June 22, 2008|accessdate=September 29, 2010|location=London|first=Elizabeth|last=Wurtzel}}</ref>

In the early 1980s Springsteen met [[Patti Scialfa]] at [[The Stone Pony]], a bar in New Jersey where local musicians perform regularly. On that particular evening she was performing alongside one of Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s pals, Bobby Bandiera, with whom she had written "At Least We Got Shoes" for \'\'Southside Johnny\'\'. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance, introduced himself to her. Soon after that, they started spending time together and became friends.<ref>Interview with Patti Scialfa, "Red-Headed Woman", page 42\xe2\x80\x9344, [[Q magazine|\'\'Q\'\' Magazine]], 1993</ref>

Early in 1984 Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the upcoming [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]]. According to the book \'\'Bruce Springsteen on Tour 1969\xe2\x80\x932005\'\' by [[Dave Marsh]], it looked like Springsteen and Scialfa were on the brink of becoming a couple through the first leg of the tour. But before that could happen, Barry Bell introduced [[Julianne Phillips]] to Springsteen and on May 13, 1985, they got married. The two were opposites in background, had an 11-year age difference and his traveling took its toll on their relationship. In 1987, Springsteen wrote his next album, \'\'Tunnel of Love,\'\' on which many of the songs described his unhappiness in the relationship with Phillips.

In 1988 the [[Tunnel of Love Express Tour]] began and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to join the tour again. She expressed reluctance at first, since she wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen told her that the tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own solo record.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Larry|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/pattiscialfa/articles/bh.html|title=E Street detour: Patti Scialfa leaves hubby Bruce Springsteen at home during road trip|work=Boston Herald|publisher=Angelfire.com|date=September 15, 2004|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love with each other during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. On August 30, 1988, Julianne filed for divorce. The Springsteen/Phillips divorce was finalized on March 1, 1989. Springsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with  \'\'The Advocate\'\', Springsteen told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received. "It\'s a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn\'t. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, \'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that\'s life.\'" He also told Wieder that, "I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, \'Hey, what does it matter?\' But it does matter. It\'s very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly\xe2\x80\x94which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals\xe2\x80\x94is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society\'s acceptance of you&nbsp;... Patti and I both found that it did mean something."<ref name="Wieder1995"/>

Springsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey, before moving to Los Angeles where they decided to start a family.<ref name="wordsmusic120">{{cite book|last= Kirkpatrick |first= Rob|page=120|year=2007|title=The Words And Music of Bruce Springsteen|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0275989380}}</ref>

On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a very private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends.<ref name="wordsmusic120" /><ref name="reader" />
Their second child, [[Jessica Rae Springsteen]], was born on December 30, 1991;<ref name="wordsmusic120" /><ref name="reader" /> and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994.<ref name="reader" /><ref>{{cite book|last= Kirkpatrick |first= Rob |page=149|year=2007|title=The Words And Music of Bruce Springsteen| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0275989380}}</ref>

When the children reached school-going age in the early 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey specifically to raise a family in a non-paparazzi environment. The grounds of his New Jersey home include a large swimming pool. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in [[Colts Neck, New Jersey]]. They also own homes in [[Wellington, Florida]] (a wealthy [[horse community]] near [[West Palm Beach]]), Los Angeles and [[Rumson, New Jersey]].

Their eldest son, Evan, graduated from [[Boston College]].

Springsteen is an activist for [[gay rights]] and has spoken out many times as a strong supporter of [[gay marriage]]. In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: "I\'ve long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with [[Governor Corzine]] when he writes that \'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is\xe2\x80\x94a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.\'"<ref>{{cite web|title=Rocker Bruce Springsteen endorses N.J. gay marriage bill|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/200/springsteen_endorses_gay_marri.html|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref> In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called "The Four 2012".

Bruce Springsteen has been a member of, or has been backed by, several bands during his career, most notably [[The E Street Band]].

Prior to signing his first record deal in 1972, Springsteen was a member of several bands, including [[Steel Mill]]. In October 1972 he formed a new band for the recording of his debut album \'\'[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]\'\', which became known as The E Street Band, although the name was not introduced until September 1974.<ref name="rs-esb">{{Cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25556603/the_band_on_bruce_their_springsteen/print|title=The Band on Bruce: Their Springsteen|last=Fricke |first= David| work= Rolling Stone|date=January 21, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2009|authorlink=David Fricke| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090125013657/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25556603/the_band_on_bruce_their_springsteen/print|archivedate=January 25, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brucespringsteen.it/e_streetx.htm|title=Bruce Springsteen Bands: from Rogues to E Street Band, passing from Castiles and Steel Mill|publisher=brucespringsteen.it}}</ref> The E Street Band performed on all of Springsteen\'s recorded works from his debut until 1982\'s \'\'[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]\'\', a solo album on which Springsteen himself played all the instruments. The full band returned for the next album \'\'[[Born in the USA]]\'\', but there then followed a period from 1988 to 1999 in which albums were recorded with [[session musicians]]. The E Street Band were briefly reunited in 1995 for new contributions to the \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' compilation, and on a more permanent basis from 1999, since which time they have recorded more albums and performed a number of high-profile tours.

The 2005 album \'\'[[Devils & Dust]]\'\' was largely a solo recording, with some contribution from session musicians and the 2006 folk rock \'\'[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]\'\' album was recorded and toured with another band, known as [[The Sessions Band]].

While Young has experimented with differing music styles throughout a varied career, including [[swing music|swing]] and [[electronic music]], most of his best known work is either [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] folk-rock and country rock or electric, amplified hard rock (most often in collaboration with the band [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]]). Musical styles such as [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] also adopted elements from Young. His influence has caused some to dub him the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godfather of Grunge]]".{{sfn|Echard|2005|p=43}}

Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of films using the pseudonym \'\'Bernard Shakey\'\', including \'\'Journey Through the Past\'\' (1973), \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' (1979), \'\'[[Human Highway]]\'\' (1982), \'\'[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]\'\' (2003), and \'\'[[CSNY/D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 Vu]]\'\' (2008). He has also contributed to the soundtracks of films including \'\'[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]\'\' (1993) and \'\'[[Dead Man]]\'\' (1995).

Young is an environmentalist<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/photos/neil-young-environmentalist-1.1716733 | title=Neil Young, environmentalist | work=CBC News}}</ref> and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the [[benefit concert]] [[Farm Aid]].

==Life and career==

===Early years (1945\xe2\x80\x931966)===

Shortly after Neil\'s birth in 1945, the Young family moved to the rural town of [[Omemee, Ontario]], which Neil would later fondly describe as a "sleepy little place".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=22\xe2\x80\x9342}} (The Youngtown Museum in Omemee is a tribute to Young.<ref>[http://www.youngtownmuseum.com/ Youngtown Rock and Roll Museum], {{convert|130|km|mi|0}}</ref>) Young was diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] as a child,<ref name="musicianguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001147/Neil-Young.html |title=Neil Young Biography \xe2\x80\x93 Discography, Music, Lyrics, Album, CD, Career, Famous Works, and Awards |publisher=Musicianguide.com |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref> and also suffered from a bout of [[polio]] in 1951, in what was the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=44}} Singer-songwriter [[Joni Mitchell]], then aged nine, also contracted the virus in this epidemic.<ref>George McKay (2009) [http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2372/1/displayFulltext.pdf \'"Crippled with nerves": popular music and polio, with particular reference to Ian Dury\'.] \'\'Popular Music\'\' 28:3, 341\xe2\x80\x93365.</ref>

After his recovery, the Young family vacationed to Florida in the United States in 1952, and upon returning to Canada soon decided to move away from Omemee and into the city of Toronto, before relocating to [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]], which is just east of Toronto, and then again to north Toronto soon afterward. It was during this period that Young began to take an interest in [[popular music]] that he heard on the radio, and also began to raise chickens in order to sell their eggs.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=46\xe2\x80\x9354}}

When Young was twelve, his father, who had been having a number of extra-marital affairs, left his mother, and she asked for and received a divorce some years later, in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last=Unger |first=Andrew|url=http://ballastmag.com/2012/09/winnipeg-vs-toronto-for-neil-young/|title=Winnipeg vs. Toronto for Neil Young|work=Ballast Magazine|date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-24}}</ref> Due to the breakup of the family, Neil went to live with his mother, who moved back to Winnipeg, while his brother Bob stayed with his father in Toronto.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp= 55\xe2\x80\x9368}} It was then that his musical drive really kicked in.

During the mid-fifties, at around the age of ten or eleven, Young was drawn to a variety of musical genres including [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[doo-wop]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Country music|country]], and western pop. He would listen to pop music broadcast on the [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] radio station via his [[transistor radio]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=50\xe2\x80\x9351}} Young has stated in interviews that he grew up idolizing [[Elvis Presley]] and strove to be just like him.

Young and his mother settled into the working class area of [[Fort Rouge, Manitoba|Fort Rouge]], Winnipeg, where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band, [[The Jades (Canadian band)|The Jades]], and met [[Ken Koblun]], later to join him in [[The Squires (Neil Young band)|The Squires]]. While attending [[Kelvin High School]] in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young\'s first stable band was called The Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called "The Sultan". Young dropped out of high school{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=103}} and also played in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called "the original Briggs".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=105}} While there, Young first encountered [[Stephen Stills]]. In the 2006 film \'\'Heart of Gold\'\', Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at [[Falcon Lake, Manitoba]], where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear [[Ian Tyson]]\'s "[[Four Strong Winds]]". The Squires played in as many dance halls and clubs in Winnipeg and Ontario as they could.

After leaving the Squires, Young worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met Joni Mitchell.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=96}} Mitchell recalls Young as having been highly influenced by [[Bob Dylan]] at the time.<ref>\'\'The Rolling Stone Interviews\'\' by Jann Werner (editor) & Joe Levy (editor). Back Bay Books (2007), ISBN 978-0-316-00526-5.</ref> Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as "[[Sugar Mountain (song)|Sugar Mountain]]", about lost youth. Mitchell wrote "The Circle Game" in response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/jammin_more.htm#joni|title=Neil Young Collaborations|publisher=Thrasher\'s Wheat|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> The Winnipeg band [[The Guess Who]] (with Randy Bachman as lead guitarist) had a Canadian Top 40 hit with Young\'s "Flying on the Ground is Wrong", which was Young\'s first major success as a songwriter.

In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, while in Toronto, he joined the [[Rick James]]-fronted [[The Mynah Birds|Mynah Birds]]. The band managed to secure a record deal with the [[Motown]] label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being [[Desertion|AWOL]] from the Reserve.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=139}} After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and the bass player [[Bruce Palmer]] relocated to Los Angeles. Young admitted in a 2009 interview that he was in the United States illegally until he received a green card in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview |title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Neil Young|work=Rolling Stone Online|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref>

===Buffalo Springfield (1966\xe2\x80\x931968)===
{{Main|Buffalo Springfield}}
Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with [[Stephen Stills]], [[Richie Furay]], and [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]] to form [[Buffalo Springfield]]. A mixture of folk, country, [[psychedelia]], and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield (album)|Buffalo Springfield]]\'\' (1966) sold well after Stills\' topical song "[[For What It\'s Worth (Stephen Stills song)|For What It\'s Worth]]" became a hit, aided by Young\'s melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. According to \'\'Rolling Stone\'\', the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock. <ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/buffalo-springfield | title= Buffalo Springfield | publisher= [[Rollingstone.com]] | accessdate=April 9, 2015}}</ref>

Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield\'s demise. A second album, \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]\'\', was released in late 1967, but two of Young\'s three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.

In many ways, these three songs on \'\'Buffalo Springfield Again\'\', "[[Mr. Soul]]", "[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]", and "[[Broken Arrow (Buffalo Springfield song)|Broken Arrow]]", are harbingers of much of Young\'s later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. "Mr. Soul" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group performed together. In contrast, "Broken Arrow" was confessional folk-rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Young\'s experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a soundbite of Dewey Martin singing "Mr. Soul" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. "Expecting to Fly" was a lushly produced [[ballad]] similar to the [[baroque pop]] of the mid-1960s, featured a string arrangement that Young\'s co-producer for the track, [[Jack Nitzsche]], would dub "symphonic pop".

In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album, \'\'[[Last Time Around]]\'\', was released, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs "On the Way Home" and "I Am a Child", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony. The three surviving members, Furay, Stills and Young, appeared together as Buffalo Springfield at Young\'s annual Bridge School Benefit on October 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 2010, and at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2011.

===Going solo, Crazy Horse (1968\xe2\x80\x931969)===
:\'\'Main articles: [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] and [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]]\'\'
After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with [[Reprise Records]], home of his colleague and friend [[Joni Mitchell]], with whom he shared a manager, [[Elliot Roberts]], who manages Young to this day. Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young\'s first solo record, \'\'[[Neil Young (album)|Neil Young]]\'\' (November 12, 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancontent.net/people/music/Neil-Young.html |title=Neil Young \xe2\x80\x93 MiniBio|publisher=Canadian Content |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> Young deprecated the album as being "overdubbed rather than played", and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some songs that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably "The Loner".

For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets: [[Danny Whitten]] on guitar, [[Billy Talbot]] on bass guitar, and [[Ralph Molina]] on drums. These three took the name [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] (after [[Crazy Horse|the historical figure of the same name]]), and \'\'[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]\'\' (May 1969), is credited to "Neil Young with Crazy Horse". Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young\'s most familiar songs, "Cinnamon Girl", and is dominated by two more, "Cowgirl in the Sand" and "Down by the River", that feature improvisations with Young\'s distinctive electric guitar solos billowing out over the hypnotic Crazy Horse backing. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of {{convert|103|\xc2\xb0F|\xc2\xb0C|abbr=on}} in bed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Neil Young, Zero to Sixty: A Critical Biography|publisher=Music Sales Distributed|year=2000|page=187|isbn=0-9529540-4-4}}</ref>

===Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (1969\xe2\x80\x931970)===

Shortly after the release of \'\'Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\'\' Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]], who had already released one album \'\'[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]\'\' as a trio in May 1969. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \xe2\x80\x93 winners of the 1969 "Best New Artist" [[Grammy Award]] \xe2\x80\x93 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: "One of you fuckin\' guys comes near me and I\'m gonna fuckin\' hit you with my guitar".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\xe2\x80\x93320}} During the making of their first album, \'\'[[D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 Vu]]\'\' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he "wanted to play folk music in a rock band."{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young\'s tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band\'s most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.

Young wrote "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y\'s "Teach Your Children" was still climbing the singles charts.

===\'\'After the Gold Rush\'\', acoustic tour and \'\'Harvest\'\' (1970\xe2\x80\x931972)===
Later in the year, Young released his third solo album, \'\'[[After the Gold Rush]]\'\' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, a young [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than \'\'Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\'\', with a wider range of sounds. Young\'s newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including "[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]" and "[[Don\'t Let It Bring You Down]]", the country-influenced singles "[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]" and "[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]", and the title track, "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young\'s bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues rock song "[[Southern Man]]" (along with a later song entitled "Alabama") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit "[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]". However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd\'s music, and the band\'s front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a \'\'Tonight\'s the Night\'\' T-shirt on the cover of an album.

In the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like "Journey through the Past", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like "See the Sky About to Rain", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young\'s tour, now entitled "Journey Through the Past", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto\'s [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young\'s Archive series.

Near the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the \'\'[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]\'\' TV show. "[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]], he scrapped plans for the imminent release<ref>[http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 Neil comments on massey hall release :: Bad News Beat :: on Neil Young]</ref> of the live acoustic recording in favor of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The result was Young\'s fourth album, \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (February 14, 1972), which would prove to be a massive hit. The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album\'s live acoustic performance of the harrowing "Needle".

Young\'s more settled personal life was reflected in the rest of the \'\'Harvest\'\' album\'s mellow, pastoral tone. After his success with CSNY, Young had been able to purchase a ranch in rural Northern California (where he has lived since), writing the song "[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]" in honor of the land\'s longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song "A Man Needs a Maid" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. "Heart of Gold" was released as the first single from \'\'Harvest\'\', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his long career. "Old Man" was also immensely popular.

The album\'s recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the \'\'[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]\'\' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described "Heart of Gold" as the song that "put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there."

===The "Ditch" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\xe2\x80\x931974)===
Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (1972), it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead. Young described the incident to \'\'Rolling Stone\'\'\'s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name="RSinterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview |title=Neil Young: The RS Interview |publisher=Rollingstone.com |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref> "[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn\'t cut it. He couldn\'t remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. \'It\'s not happening, man. You\'re not together enough.\' He just said, \'I\'ve got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?\' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he\'d [[overdosed|OD\'d]]. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure."

On the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, \'\'[[Time Fades Away]]\'\' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as "[his] least favorite record", and it is one of only two of Young\'s early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album \'\'[[Journey Through the Past]]\'\'). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. \'\'Time Fades Away\'\', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. \'\'Time\'\' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the "Ditch Trilogy", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (1972).<ref name=UnCut>{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young\'s \'Time Fades Away\': \'Harvest\'s unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010 |issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young\'s inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.

[[File:neilyoung2.jpg|thumb|upright|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976.]]
In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse\'s rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and \'\'Harvest\'\'/\'\'Time Fades Away\'\' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, \'\'[[Tonight\'s the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight\'s the Night]]\'\' (June 20, 1975). The album\'s dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would release it.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company delayed the release, Young recorded another album, \'\'[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]\'\' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song "See the Sky About to Rain", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like \'\'Time Fades Away\'\', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young\'s most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of \'\'On the Beach\'\' described the music as "mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary".<ref name=sven>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \xe2\x80\x93 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2004}}</ref>

After completing \'\'On the Beach\'\', Young reunited with \'\'Harvest\'\' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, \'\'[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]\'\'. Most of the songs were written after Young\'s breakup with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though \'\'Homegrown\'\' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, \'\'Tonight\'s the Night\'\', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: "It was a little too personal ... it scared me".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from \'\'Homegrown\'\' were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. \'\'Tonight\'s the Night\'\', when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the "ditch" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young\'s own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}

===Reunions, retrospectives and \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' (1974\xe2\x80\x931979)===
Young reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour.

In 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, \'\'[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]\'\' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; "[[Cortez the Killer]]", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. \'\'Zuma\'\'\'s closing track, "Through My Sails", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.

In 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album \'\'[[Long May You Run]]\'\' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: "Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=502}}

[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|left|thumb|\'\'The Last Waltz\'\', Young (center on left microphone) performing with Bob Dylan and [[The Band]], among others in 1976.]]
In 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert \'\'[[The Last Waltz]]\'\', the final performance by The Band. The release of [[Martin Scorsese]]\'s movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young\'s nose during his performance of "[[Helpless (song)|Helpless]]".<ref name=Exclaim>{{cite web |last=Schneider |first=Jason |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741 |title=Neil Young \xe2\x80\x93 Searching for a Heart of Gold |date=August 4, 2003 |publisher=Exclaim! |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030901150951/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741 |archivedate=September 1, 2003}}</ref> \'\'[[American Stars \'N Bars]]\'\' (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the \'\'Homegrown\'\' album, "Homegrown" and "Star of Bethlehem", as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "[[Like a Hurricane (Neil Young song)|Like a Hurricane]]". Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation \'\'[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]\'\', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.

\'\'[[Comes a Time]]\'\' (October 2, 1978), Young\'s first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young\'s most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]\'s "[[Four Strong Winds]]", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album\'s songs, "[[Lotta Love]]", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young\'s film \'\'[[Human Highway]]\'\', which took its name from a song featured on \'\'Comes a Time\'\'. Over four years, Young would spend [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000 of his own money on production. This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=575\xe2\x80\x93577}}

Young set out in 1978 on the lengthy "Rust Never Sleeps" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an aggressive style of playing, were later seen as a response to punk rock.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Two new songs, the acoustic "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]" and electric "[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]" were the centerpiece of the new material. Their lyrics have been among Young\'s most widely quoted. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased "King" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young\'s records on a London radio show, an early sign of Young\'s eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Young\'s two accompanying albums \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and \'\'[[Live Rust]]\'\' (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym [[Bernard Shakey]]. Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the \'\'[[Star Wars]]\'\' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young\'s work since \'\'Harvest\'\' (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well. \'\'[[The Village Voice]]\'\' named \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' as the year\'s winner in the [[Pazz & Jop|Pazz & Jop Poll]], a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade. The [[Warner Music Vision]] release on VHS of \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' in 1987 had a running time of 116 minutes, and although fully manufactured in Germany, was initially imported from there by the markets throughout Europe.

===Experimental years (1980\xe2\x80\x931988)===
At the start of the decade, distracted by domestic medical concerns relating to his second disabled son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording.<ref name="Hawks & Doves Review">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22517|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hawks & Doves Review|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> After providing the incidental music to a 1980 biographical film of [[Hunter S.

1981\'s \'\'[[Re-ac-tor]]\'\', an electric album recorded with Crazy Horse, also included material from the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22518|pure_url=yes}}|title=Reactor Review|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Young did not tour in support of either album; in total, he played only one show, a set at the 1980 Bread and Roses Festival in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/years/80nysets.html|title=Neil Young Setlists: 1980|publisher=Sugar Mountain|accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822045439/http://www.sugarmtn.org/years/80nysets.html |archivedate = August 22, 2008}}</ref> between the end of his 1978 tour with Crazy Horse and the start of his tour with the Trans Band in mid-1982.

 }}

The 1982 album \'\'[[Trans (album)|Trans]]\'\', which incorporated [[vocoder]]s, synthesizers, and electronic beats, was Young\'s first for the new label [[Geffen Records]] (distributed at the time by [[Warner Bros. Records]], whose parent [[Warner Music Group]] owns most of Young\'s solo and band catalog) and represented a distinct stylistic departure. Young later revealed that an inspiration for the album was the theme of technology and communication with his son Ben, who has severe [[cerebral palsy]] and cannot speak.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22519|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|title=Trans Review|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> An extensive tour preceded the release of the album, and was documented by the video \'\'[[Neil Young in Berlin]]\'\', which saw release in 1986. MTV played the video for "Sample and Hold" in light rotation. The entire song contained "robot vocals" by Neil and Nils Lofgren.

[[File:Para Rael99 (que nos quiten lo bailao).jpg|thumb|190px|Young playing in Barcelona, Spain, 1984]]
Young\'s next album, 1983\'s \'\'[[Everybody\'s Rockin\']]\'\', included several [[rockabilly]] covers and clocked in at less than twenty-five minutes in length. Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting U.S. tour. \'\'Trans\'\' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with \'\'Everybody\'s Rockin\'\'\' following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music "unrepresentative" of himself.<ref>{{cite book |title= A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last= Cavallo|first= Dominick|year= 1999|publisher= [[St. Martin\'s Press]]|location= New York|isbn= 0-312-21930-X|oclc= 39981636}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \xe2\x80\x93 [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for "Wonderin\'" and "Cry, Cry, Cry". Also premiered in 1983, though little seen, was the eclectic full-length comedy film \'\'[[Human Highway]]\'\', co-directed and co-written by Young, and starring Young, [[Dean Stockwell]], [[Russ Tamblyn]], [[Dennis Hopper]] and members of [[Devo]].

The first year without a Neil Young album since the start of Young\'s musical career with Buffalo Springfield in 1966 was in 1984. Young\'s lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album \'\'Old Ways\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> It was also the year when Young\'s third child, this with his second with wife Pegi, was born: his daughter Amber Jean, a child who was later diagnosed with inherited epilepsy.

Young spent most of 1984 and all of 1985 touring for \'\'[[Old Ways]]\'\' (August 12, 1985) with his country band, the International Harvesters. The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year\'s [[Live Aid]] concert in [[Philadelphia]], collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet\'s first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.

Young\'s last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young\'s music. Young recorded 1986\'s \'\'[[Landing on Water]]\'\' without Crazy Horse, but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, \'\'[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]\'\', which emerged in 1987. Young\'s album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today \'\'Life\'\' remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.<ref>As of June 2008 {{cite web|title=Neil Young Worldwide Album Sales Estimates|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/communaute/index.php?showtopic=6523&st=1365&gopid=969589&#entry969589|date=June 14, 2008|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>

Switching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician [[Harold Melvin]] forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988\'s \'\'[[This Note\'s For You]]\'\' became Young\'s first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, "What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=24\xe2\x80\x9332}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young\'s home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.

Young reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash to record the 1988 album \'\'[[American Dream (album)|American Dream]]\'\' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour. The album was only the second-ever studio record for the quartet.

===Return to prominence (1989\xe2\x80\x931999)===
[[File:Neil Young 1996.jpg|thumb|210px|Young performing in 1996 in [[Turku]], [[Finland]]]]
Young\'s 1989 single "[[Rockin\' in the Free World]]", which hit No.&nbsp;2 on the U.S. mainstream-rock charts, and accompanying album, \'\'[[Freedom (1989 album)|Freedom]]\'\', rocketed him back into the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album\'s lyrics were often overtly political; "Rockin\' in the Free World" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin\' in the Free World | url = http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm | publisher = www.thrasherswheat.org | accessdate = 2009-04-01}}</ref>

The use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several \'\'Freedom\'\' tracks was reminiscent of the \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' (1979) album, and foreshadowed the imminent rise of [[grunge]]. The rising stars of the genre, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]\'s [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Pearl Jam]]\'s [[Eddie Vedder]], frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called \'\'[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]\'\' was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies]].

Young\'s 1990 album \'\'[[Ragged Glory]]\'\', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy aesthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band [[Social Distortion]] and [[alternative rock]] pioneers [[Sonic Youth]] as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.<ref name=sonic>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/sonic_youth.htm |title=Sonic Youth and Neil Young|publisher=Thrasher\'s Wheat \xe2\x80\x93 A Neil Young Archives | accessdate = 2009-04-01}}</ref> \'\'[[Weld (album)|Weld]]\'\', a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.<ref name=sonic/> Sonic Youth\'s influence was most evident on \'\'[[Arc (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Arc]]\'\', a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Sonic Youth\'s [[Thurston Moore]] and originally packaged with some versions of \'\'Weld\'\'.<ref name=sonic/>

1992\'s \'\'[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]\'\' marked an abrupt return to the country and folk-rock stylings of \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (1972) and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including singers [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]]. The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to [[Randy Bachman]]\'s nostalgic 1992 tune "Prairie Town", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song "Philadelphia", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An \'\'[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]\'\' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of "Rockin\' in the Free World" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.
[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]].]]

In 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for \'\'[[Sleeps with Angels]]\'\', a record whose dark, sombre mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]\'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain\'s life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young\'s lyric "It\'s better to burn out than fade away" (a line from "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)|My My, Hey Hey]]") in [[Death of Kurt Cobain#Suicide note|his suicide note]]. Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to his death.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/10/1021002387905.html |title=Neil Young: the quiet achiever|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2010-01-26 | date=May 11, 2002}}</ref> Young and Pearl Jam performed "Act of Love" at an abortion rights benefit along with Crazy Horse, and were present at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner, sparking interest in a collaboration between the two.<ref>{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Neil | date=July 2, 1995 | title=The Predictably Unpredictable Neil Young | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/arts/the-predictably-unpredictable-neil-young.html | publisher=The New York Times | accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> Still enamored with the grunge scene, Young reconnected with Pearl Jam in 1995 for the live-in-the-studio album \'\'[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]\'\' and a tour of Europe with the band and producer [[Brendan O\'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O\'Brien]] backing Young. 1995 also marked Young\'s induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], where he was inducted by Eddie Vedder.

:"Young has consistently demonstrated the unbridled passion of an artist who understands that self-renewal is the only way to avoid burning out. For this reason, he has remained one of the most significant artists of the rock and roll era." \xe2\x80\x93 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] website.<ref name="rockhall.com"/><ref name="R&R Hall of Fame1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/neil-young/bio/|title=Neil Young Biography|year=2013|work=Neil Young biography at the Rock and roll Hall of Fame|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

Young\'s next collaborative partner was filmmaker [[Jim Jarmusch]], who asked Young to compose a [[Dead Man (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to his 1995 black and white western film \'\'[[Dead Man]]\'\'. Young\'s instrumental soundtrack was improvised while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of longtime mentor, friend, and producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]] in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour \'\'[[Broken Arrow (album)|Broken Arrow]]\'\'. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, \'\'[[Year of the Horse]]\'\', emerged in 1997. From 1996\xe2\x80\x9397 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] Festival\'s sixth annual tour.

In 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band [[Phish]], sharing the stage at the annual [[Farm Aid]] concert and then at Young\'s Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of "[[Helpless (song)|Helpless]]" and "[[I Shall Be Released]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperrust.org/Bridge/Bridge12.html |title=Bridge Benefit XII |publisher=Hyperrust |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref> Phish declined Young\'s later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.

The decade ended with the release in late 1999 of \'\'[[Looking Forward]]\'\', another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet earned US$42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.

===Continued activism and brush with death (2000s)===
[[File:Csny-8-20-06.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (in photo, from L to R: Nash, Stills, Young, and Crosby) perform at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]] in 2006.]]
Neil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium. The studio album \'\'[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]\'\' and live album \'\'[[Road Rock Vol. 1]]\'\' were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films. His 2001 single "Let\'s Roll" was a tribute to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[Let\'s Roll|effective action taken by the passengers and crew]] on [[United Airlines flight 93|Flight 93]] in particular.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20011216song1216lnp5.asp|title=Flight 93\'s Beamer inspires song by Neil Young|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=December 16, 2001|accessdate=2009-04-04 | first=Linton | last=Weeks}}</ref> At the "[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]" benefit concert for the victims of the attacks, Young performed [[John Lennon]]\'s "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" and accompanied Eddie Vedder and [[Mike McCready]] on "Long Road", a Pearl Jam song that was written with Young during the \'\'Mirrorball\'\' sessions. "Let\'s Roll" was included on 2002\'s \'\'[[Are You Passionate?]]\'\', an album mostly composed of mellow love songs dedicated to Young\'s wife, Pegi, backed by [[Booker T. & the M.G.s]].

In 2003, Young released \'\'[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]\'\', a [[concept album]] recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and [[Ralph Molina]]. The songs loosely revolved around the murder of a police officer in a small town in California and its effects on the town\'s inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicbox-online.com/ny-green.html|title=Greendale Review|publisher=The Music Box|date=November 2003|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Under the pseudonym "Bernard Shakey", Young directed an accompanying film of the same name, featuring actors lip-synching to the music from the album. He toured extensively with the \'\'Greendale\'\' material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, Japan, and Australia. Young began using [[biodiesel]] on the 2004 Greendale tour, powering his trucks and tour buses with the fuel. "Our Greendale tour is now ozone friendly," he said. "I plan to continue to use this government approved and regulated fuel exclusively from now on to prove that it is possible to deliver the goods anywhere in North America without using foreign oil, while being environmentally responsible."<ref name="biodiesel">{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2004/02/hollywood-stars-shine-spotlight-on-green-power-10616 |title=Hollywood Stars Shine Spotlight on Green Power &#124; Renewable Energy News Article |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref> Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.

[[File:Stephen Stills and Neil Young 2006.jpg|thumb|240px|Stills and Young performing together on the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young 2006 tour]]
In March 2005, while working on the \'\'[[Prairie Wind]]\'\' album in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Young was diagnosed with a brain [[aneurysm]]. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive [[Neuroradiology|neuroradiological]] procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29,<ref>{{cite news | title = Neil Young treated for \'dangerous\' aneurysm | url = http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/01/neil.young/ | publisher = CNN.com | date = April 1, 2005 | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> but two days afterwards he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the [[femoral artery]], which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Resurrection of Neil Young | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1109363,00.html | publisher = Time | date = September 26, 2005 | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the [[Juno Awards]] telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Barrie, Ontario]], on July 2. During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called "When God Made Me". Young\'s brush with death influenced \'\'Prairie Wind\'\'\'s themes of retrospection and mortality.<ref>{{cite web | title = Prairie Wind Music Review | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neilyoung/albums/album/7637213/review/7645148/prairie_wind | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = October 6, 2005 | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> The album\'s live premiere in Nashville was immortalized by filmmaker [[Jonathan Demme]] in the 2006 film \'\'[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]\'\'.

Young\'s renewed activism manifested itself in the 2006 album \'\'[[Living With War]]\'\', which like the much earlier song "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]", was recorded and released in less than a month as a direct result of current events.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r837350|pure_url=yes}}|title=Living With War Review|publisher=allmusic|date=May 9, 2006|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> In early 2006, three years after the US invasion of Iraq, the sectarian war and casualties there were escalating. While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded US veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any [[protest song]]s, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.

Most of the album\'s songs rebuked the Bush administration\'s policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, "[[Let\'s Impeach the President]]",<ref>{{cite web | title = Living With War Review | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = May 1, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young\'s lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] reunited for the supporting "Freedom of Speech Tour \'06", in which they played Young\'s new protest songs alongside the group\'s older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically. \'\'[[CSNY D\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 Vu]]\'\', a concert film of the tour directed by Young himself, was released in 2008, along with an accompanying live album.

While Young had never been a stranger to eco-friendly lyrics, themes of environmentalist spirituality and activism became increasingly prominent in his work throughout the 1990s and 2000s, especially on \'\'[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]\'\' (2003)<ref>{{cite web | title = Neil Young Goes Green on the Road | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jonathanrichman/articles/story/5937268/neil_young_goes_green | publisher = Rolling Stone | date = February 27, 2004 | accessdate = 2009-03-31}}</ref> and \'\'[[Living with War]]\'\' (2006).<ref>"[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Reprise-692104.html New Neil Young Video \'After The Garden\' Visits \'An Inconvenient Truth\']," \'\'Marketwire\'\' (July 21, 2006).</ref> The trend continued on 2007\'s \'\'[[Chrome Dreams II]]\'\', with lyrics exploring Young\'s personal eco-spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young: Chrome Dreams II|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.lwL4KnN1LtH/b.3779923/k.1891/Neil_Young_iChrome_Dreams_IIi.htm|publisher=[[United Methodist Church]]|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> Also in 2007, Young accepted an invitation to participate in \'\'[[Goin\' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]\'\', contributing his version of "[[Walking to New Orleans]]".

Young remains on the board of directors of [[Farm Aid]], an organization he co-founded with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[John Mellencamp]] in 1985. According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the USA, and it has raised $43 million since its first benefit concert in 1985. Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers who include [[Dave Matthews]] and producers who include [[Evelyn Shriver]] and [[Mark Rothbaum]], at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts in order to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent [[foreclosure]]s, provide a crisis hotline, and create and promote home grown farm food in the United States.<ref name="Young and Farm Aid1">{{cite web|url=http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2723677/k.961B/Board_and_Staff.htm|title=Farm Aid\'s Hardworking Board and Staff|year=2010|work=Farm Aid information about the board, staff, and concerts|publisher=Farm Aid|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref>

Unfortunately, the car caught fire in November 2010, in a California warehouse, and along the way it burned an estimated US$850,000 worth of Young\'s rock and roll memorabilia collection. Initial reports suggest the fire might have been triggered by an error in the vehicle\'s plug-in charging system. Young blamed the fire on human error and said he and his team were committed to rebuilding the car. "The wall charging system was not completely tested and had never been left unattended. A mistake was made. It was not the fault of the car", he said.

A Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theater]] in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], Pennsylvania, called the \'\'[[Neil Young Trunk Show]]\'\' premiered on March 21, 2009, at the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas.

Young\'s most recent album appearance was on the album \'\'[[Potato Hole]]\'\', released on April 21, 2009 by Memphis organ player [[Booker T. Jones]], of [[Booker T. & the MGs]] fame. Young plays guitar on nine of the album\'s ten instrumental tracks, alongside [[Drive-By Truckers]], who already had three guitar players, giving some songs on the album a total of five guitar tracks. Jones contributed guitars on a couple of tracks.

Young continues to tour extensively. In 2009, he headlined the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]], and [[Glastonbury Festival]] in [[Pilton, Somerset|Pilton, England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/2009/artists/neilyoung/index.shtml|title=Neil Young keep on rocking in the free world|publisher=bbc Glastonbury online|accessdate=2009-06-28}}</ref> at [[Hard Rock Calling]] in London (where he was joined onstage by [[Paul McCartney]] for a rendition of "[[A Day in the Life]]") and, after years of unsuccessful booking attempts, the [[Isle of Wight Festival]]<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/03/07/young-wight-festival.html?ref=rss|title= Neil Young Announced as Final Isle of Wight Festival Headliner|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|accessdate= 2009-03-05|date= March 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> in addition to performances at the [[Big Day Out]] festival in New Zealand and Australia and the [[Primavera Sound Festival]] in Barcelona.

Young has been a vocal opponent of the proposed [[Keystone XL]] oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas. When discussing the environmental impact on the oilsands of [[Fort McMurray]], Alberta, Young asserted that the area now resembles the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack of World War II.<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite news | title = Neil Young: Pipelines are \xe2\x80\x98Scabs on Our Lives,\xe2\x80\x99 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Care If Activism Hurts Record Sales | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/11/10/neil-young-pipelines-oilsands_n_6131170.html | first = Camille | last = Bains | publisher = thehuffingtonpost.com | date = October 11, 2014 | accessdate = April 9, 2015}}</ref> Young has referred to issues surrounding the proposed use of oil pipelines as \xe2\x80\x9cscabs on our lives\xe2\x80\x9d. <ref name="huffingtonpost1"/> In an effort to become more involved, Young has worked directly with the Athabasca Chipewyan First nation to draw attention to this issue, performing benefit concerts and speaking publicly on the subject. 

Young participated in the Blue Dot Tour, which was organized and fronted by environmental activist [[David Suzuki]], and toured all 10 Canadian provinces alongside other Canadian artists including the [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Feist]], and Robert Bateman. The intent of Young\xe2\x80\x99s participation in this tour was to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by the exploitation of tar sands. Young has argued that the amount of CO2 released as a byproduct of tarsand oil extraction is equivalent to the amount released by the total number of cars in Canada each day. <ref name="straight1">{{cite news | title = Neil Young featured in Vancouver on David Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s Blue Dot tour | url = http://www.straight.com/news/691966/neil-young-featured-vancouver-david-suzukis-blue-dot-tour | first = Charlie | last = Smith | publisher = straight.com | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = April 9, 2015}}</ref> Young has faced criticism by representatives from within the Canadian petroleum industry, who have argued that his statements are irresponsible. <ref name="huffingtonpost1"/> Young\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the construction of oil pipelines has influenced his music as well. His song, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s Going to Stand Up?\xe2\x80\x9d was written to protest this issue, and features the lyric \xe2\x80\x9cBan fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline\xe2\x80\x9d. <ref name="huffingtonpost1"/>

In addition to directly criticizing members of the oil industry, Young has also focused blame on the actions of the Canadian Government for ignoring the conclusions regarding the environmental impacts of climate change. He referred to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper as \xe2\x80\x9can embarrassment to many Canadians \xe2\x80\xa6[and] a very poor imitation of the George Bush administration in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d. <ref name="straight1"/> Young has also been critical of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s government for failing to uphold the promises made regarding environmental policies during his election campaign. <ref name="straight1"/>

===New performances (2010s)===
[[File:Neil Young 2010.jpg|thumb|Young performing at Farm Aid, Oct 2, 2010]]
On January 22, 2010, Young performed "Long May You Run" on the final episode of \'\'[[The Tonight Show with Conan O\'Brien]]\'\'. On the same night, he and [[Dave Matthews]] performed the [[Hank Williams]] song "Alone and Forsaken", for the \'\'[[Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief]]\'\' charity telethon, in response to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. Young also performed "Long May You Run" at the [[2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony of the 2010 Olympic winter games]] in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In May 2010, it was revealed Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. This was announced by David Crosby, who said that the album "will be a very heartfelt record. I expect it will be a very special record."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/neil-young/50941 |title=Neil Young working on new album with Bob Dylan and U2 producer |publisher=Nme.com |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref> On May 18, 2010, Young embarked upon a North American solo tour to promote his then upcoming album, \'\'[[Le Noise]]\'\', playing a mix of older songs and new material. Although billed as a solo acoustic tour, Young also played some songs on electric guitars, including Old Black.<ref name="americansong">{{cite web|last=Inman|first=Davis|title=Neil Young\'s Twisted Road tour begins|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2010/05/neil-youngs-twisted-road-tour-begins/|publisher=American Songwriter|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> Young continued his Twisted Road tour with a short East Coast venture during spring 2011. Young also contributed vocals to the [[Elton John]]\xe2\x80\x93[[Leon Russell]] album \'\'[[The Union (Elton John and Leon Russell album)|The Union]]\'\', singing the second stanza on the track "Gone to Shiloh" and providing backing vocals.

In September 2011, Jonathan Demme\'s third documentary film on the singer songwriter, \'\'[[Neil Young Journeys]]\'\', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|author=TIFF |url=http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiff/2011/neilyoungjourneys |title=2011 Films \xe2\x80\x93 Neil Young Journeys |publisher=[[tiff.net]] |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> Like Demme\'s earlier work with Young, most of the film consists of a simply filmed live performance, in this case, Young\'s homecoming show in May 2011 at Toronto\'s [[Massey Hall]], four decades after he first played at the iconic venue. Playing old songs, as well as new ones from \'\'Le Noise\'\', Young performs solo on both electric and acoustic instruments. His performance is a counterpoint to Demme\'s footage of Young\'s return to [[Omemee, Ontario]], the small town near Toronto where he grew up, which has now become physically unrecognizable, though he vividly recalls events from his childhood there.

As of 2008, Young lives near<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theland.wikispaces.com/Star+Hill|title=Star Hill|publisher=The Land|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref> [[La Honda, California]], on his Broken Arrow Ranch, named after one of his early Buffalo Springfield songs.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thrasherswheat.org/ptma/spin1195.htm|title= Neil Young Interview|publisher = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]| date = November 1995| accessdate = 2009-04-04}}</ref> The original {{convert|140|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel was purchased in 1970 for US$350,000 cash<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/14655/Neil-Young-Chaos-Is-Good|title= Neil Young: Chaos Is Good|publisher=JamBase|year = 2011| accessdate = 2011-07-09}}</ref> and has grown to thousands of acres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neilyoung-tribute.com/neilyoung.html|title= Neil Young (1,500 acres)|publisher= Jeff Taylor\'s Neil Young Tribute| accessdate= 2011-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperrust.org/Words/Pulse1191.html|title=The Godfather of Grunge Rock (2,000 acres)|publisher=HyperRust|date=December 1991|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusmediaink.com/Jewel.html|title=Jewel at The Hideaway (3,000 acres)|publisher=[[Hamilton Spectator]]|date=June 8, 1995|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref>

On January 22, 2012, the Master Class at the [[2012 Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance Festival]] featured Coffee with Neil Young & Jonathan Demme for their new film \'\'[[Neil Young Journeys]]\'\'.

Neil Young with Crazy Horse released the album \'\'[[Americana (Neil Young Crazy Horse album)|Americana]]\'\' on June 5, 2012. It was Young\'s first collaboration with Crazy Horse since the Greendale album and tour in 2003 and 2004.  The record is a tribute to unofficial national anthems that jumps from an uncensored version of "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" to "[[Oh My Darling, Clementine|Clementine]]" and includes a version of "[[God Save the Queen]]", which Young grew up singing every day in school in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rcrdlbl.com/2012/05/29/album_stream_neil_young_crazy_horse_americana |title=ALBUM STREAM: Neil Young & Crazy Horse \xe2\x80\x93 Americana |publisher=Rcrd Lbl|date=May 29, 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-02}}</ref> \'\'Americana\'\' is Neil Young\'s first album composed entirely of cover songs.

Neil Young with Crazy Horse launched a new tour on August 3, 2012, in anticipation of their second album of 2012, \'\'[[Psychedelic Pill]]\'\', which was released in late October.

On October 3, 2012, the apparent third installment of the "Rust Trilogy" (Essentially 1979\'s \'\'Rust Never Sleeps\'\' and 1991\'s \'\'Weld\'\') was announced. The album, tentatively titled \'\'Alchemy\'\', appears to follow Neil Young and Crazy Horse through their 2012 North American tour.

On September 25, 2012 Young\'s autobiography \'\'[[Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream]]\'\' was released to critical and commercial acclaim.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.amazon.com/Waging-Heavy-Peace-Neil-Young/dp/0399159460 | title=Waging Heavy Peace [Hardcover] | publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] | accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> Reviewing the book for the \'\'New York Times\'\', [[Janet Maslin]] reported that Young chose to write his memoirs in 2012 for two reasons. For one, he needed to take a break from stage performances for health reasons but continue to generate income. For another, he feared the onset of dementia, considering his father\'s medical history and his own present condition. Maslin gives the book a higher than average grade, describing it as frank but quirky and without pathos as it delves into his relationships and his experience in parenting a child with disabilities as well as his artistic and commercial activities and associations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/books/neil-youngs-memoir-waging-heavy-peace.html?_r=0 |title=While He Can Still Remember |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 28, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>

In November 2013, Neil Young performed at the annual fundraiser for the [[Silverlake Conservatory of Music]]. Following after the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he played an acoustic set to a crowd who had paid a minimum of $2,000 a seat to attend the benefit in the famous Paramour Mansion overlooking downtown Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Randy |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-silverlake-conservatory-red-hot-chili-peppers-20131101,0,3626187.story#axzz2jyHi7Ahl |title=Neil Young sets tone at benefit for children\'s education |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

===Archives project===
{{main|Neil Young Archives}}
As far back as 1988, Young spoke in interviews of his efforts to compile his unreleased material and to remaster his existing catalog. The collection was eventually titled the [[Neil Young Archives]] Series. The first installment, titled \'\'[[The Archives Vol. 1 1963\xe2\x80\x931972]]\'\', was originally planned for a 2007 release but was delayed, and released on June 2, 2009.

Three performances from the \'\'Performance Series\'\' of the archives were released individually before \'\'The Archives Vol. 1\'\'. \'\'[[Live at the Fillmore East (Neil Young album)|Live at the Fillmore East]]\'\', a selection of songs from a 1970 gig with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]], was released in 2006. \'\'[[Live at Massey Hall 1971]]\'\', a solo acoustic set from Toronto\'s Massey Hall, saw release in 2007. \'\'[[Sugar Mountain - Live at Canterbury House 1968]]\'\', an early solo performance and, chronologically, the first disc in the performance series, emerged late in 2008.

In an interview in 2008, Neil Young discussed \'\'[[Neil Young Archives#Toast|Toast]]\'\', an album originally recorded with Crazy Horse in San Francisco in 2000 but never released.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/04/01/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-to-release-lost-2000-album/|title= Neil Young \xe2\x80\x93 There\'ll never be another Crazy Horse|accessdate= 2009-03-28|publisher= Rolling Stone|date= December 4, 2008}}</ref> The album will be part of the \'\'Special Edition Series\'\' of the Archives. No release date currently exists for \'\'Toast\'\'. The album   \'\'[[A Treasure]],\'\' with live tracks from a 1984\xe2\x80\x9385 tour with the International Harvesters, during a time when he was being sued by Geffen Records, was released in June 2011.

On July 14, 2009, Young\'s first four solo albums were reissued as remastered [[HDCD]] discs and digital downloads as discs 1\xe2\x80\x934 of the \'\'Original Release Series\'\' of the Archives.

==Personal life==
Young had a long-term relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. The song "A Man Needs a Maid" from \'\'Harvest\'\' is inspired by him seeing her in the film \'\'[[Diary of a Mad Housewife]]\'\'. They met soon afterward and she moved in with him on his new ranch in northern California. The union produced a son, Zeke, who was born September 8, 1972  with what was thought to be [[cerebral palsy]], but which doctors later attributed to a slight brain aneurysm before birth. They split up in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Plummer |first=William |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086004,00.html |title=\'Mad Housewife\' Carrie Snodgress Sues Rocker Neil Young for Support of Their Handicapped Son |journal=People |date=September 26, 1983 |volume=20 |issue=13 |accessdate=11 April 2015}}</ref>

Young met future wife [[Pegi Young]] in 1974 when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song "Unknown Legend". They married in 1978 and have two children together, Ben and Amber. Ben has [[cerebral palsy]]. On July 29, 2014, Young filed for divorce after 36 years of marriage. The couple were musical collaborators and co-founded the [[Bridge School (California)|Bridge School]] in 1986.<ref name=rollingstoneaug2014>{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/neil-young-files-for-divorce-from-pegi-young-wife-of-36-years-20140826 | title=Neil Young Files for Divorce From Pegi Young, Wife of 36 Years | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date= August 26, 2014| accessdate= August 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardianaug2014>{{cite news | url = http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/27/neil-young-divorce-pegi | title=Neil Young files for divorce from Pegi, his wife of 36 years | work = [[The Guardian]] | date= August 27, 2014| accessdate= January 23, 2015}}</ref>

==Instruments==

===Guitars===
[[File:Neil Young in Nottingham 2009 (k).jpg|thumb|200px|Young performing with Old Black in 2009]]
In 2003, \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' listed Young as eighty-third in its ranking of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" (although in a more recent version of the list, he has been moved up to seventeenth place), describing him as a "restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."<ref>{{cite news |title=100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time \xe2\x80\x93 Neil Young|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician [[Larry Cragg]] in the film \'\'[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]\'\'. They include:
* 1953 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Goldtop]]. Nicknamed "[[Old Black]]", this is Young\'s primary electric guitar and is featured on \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' (1979) and other albums. Old Black got its name from an amateur paintjob applied to the originally gold body of the instrument, sometime before Young acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini [[humbucker]] pickup from a [[Gibson Firebird]] was installed in the lead/treble position. This pickup, severely [[microphonic]], is considered a crucial component of Young\'s sound. A [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] was installed as early as 1969, and can be heard during the opening of "[[Cowgirl in the Sand]]" from \'\'[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]\'\'.
* [[Martin D-45]]. His primary [[Steel-string guitar|steel-string acoustic guitar]], used to write "[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]" and many other songs. It was one of four instruments bought by Stephen Stills for himself and his band-mates in CSNY in order to celebrate their first full concert at the Greek Theater in 1969.
* Martin D-28. Nicknamed "Hank" after its previous owner, [[Hank Williams]]. [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], had traded it for some shotguns; it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young\'s longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from [[Tut Taylor]]. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and the song it inspired, "This Old Guitar", can be seen about 50 minutes into the film \'\'[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]\'\'. It is Young\'s primary guitar for \'\'[[Prairie Wind (album)|Prairie Wind]]\'\'(2005).
[[File:NeilYgretsch.jpg|thumb|200px|Young playing a [[Gretsch White Falcon]] in Cologne, June 19, 2009]]
* Vintage Martin D-18: Young used an old D-18 throughout his early days performing in coffee houses in Canada and on some early [[Buffalo Springfield]] work, before he received the D-45 from Stills. It can also be seen on unreleased footage from the Woodstock documentary, particularly on an exceptional acoustic duet of the Buffalo Springfield track "[[Mr. Soul]]" with Stills. The guitar has often been used to carry "dropped standard tuning" (DGCFAD) which Young often uses in concert. This allowed him to perform songs such as "Ambulance Blues" and "[[Don\'t Let It Bring You Down]]" live without having to tune all 6 strings onstage.
Other notable (or odd) instruments played by Young include:
* [[Taylor Guitars|Taylor 855]] 12-string, used in the first half of \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' (1979).
* 1927 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] Mastertone, a six-string [[banjo guitar]], a banjo body tuned like a guitar, used on many recordings and played by [[James Taylor]] on "[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]".
* [[Gretsch 6120]] ([[Chet Atkins]] model). Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar during his [[Buffalo Springfield]] days.
* [[Gretsch White Falcon]]. Young purchased a late 1950s model near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era; in 1969 he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young\'s early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]", "[[Southern Man]]", "Alabama", "Words (Between the Lines of Age)", and "L.A.". It was Young\'s primary electric guitar during the \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (1972) era, since Young\'s deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul difficult.<ref>David Simons, "Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young\'s Classic 1972 Album." \'\'Acoustic Guitar\'\' 103 (July 2001): 38\xe2\x80\x9340.</ref> This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps, a Fender Deluxe and either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the \'\'[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]\'\' (1972) song "Words".
* [[Gibson Flying V]], on the \'\'[[Time Fades Away]]\'\' tour.
* [[Fender Broadcaster]], on the \'\'[[Tonight\'s the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight\'s the Night]]\'\' (1975) album and tour.
* Guild M-20, seen in the film Journeys.

===Reed organ===
Young owns an [[Estey Organ|Estey]] [[reed organ]], serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert and which was recently restored.  The instrument and its restoration are documented in \'\'The Reed Society Quarterly\'\' (30.1: 6ff); a photograph of the instrument is on the cover.

===Amplification===
Young uses various vintage [[Fender Tweed Deluxe]] [[amplifier]]s. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 from Saul Bettman\'s Music in Los Angeles and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/ptma/equip.htm |title=Neil Young\'s Equipment |publisher=Thrasherswheat.org |date=August 31, 1996 |accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950s [[Magnatone]] 280 (similar to the amplifier used by [[Lonnie Mack]] and [[Buddy Holly]]). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on "See the Sky About to Rain". A notable and unique accessory to Young\'s Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier\'s settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an [[effects pedal]]. Tom Wheeler\'s book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/randybachman|title=BBC documentary Neil Young: Don\'t Be Denied \xe2\x80\x93 Randy Bachmann interviews}}</ref>

* [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]], 1982
* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first in 1995 for his solo work and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.
* In 2006, Artist of the Year by the [[Americana Music Association|American Music Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://americanamusic.org/recipient-archive|title = AMA awards recipient archive|date = |accessdate = 2014-02-11|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

As one of the original founders of [[Farm Aid]] (1985\xe2\x80\x93), he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in [[Mountain View, California]], he and his wife host the [[Bridge School Benefit|Bridge School Concerts]], which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Who]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]], [[R.E.M]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Metallica]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Dave Matthews]]. The concerts are a benefit for the Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young\'s involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have [[cerebral palsy]] and his daughter, like Young himself, has [[epilepsy]].

Young was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1994 for his song "Philadelphia" from the film \'\'[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]\'\'. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that "the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee\'s song." That same night, [[Tom Hanks]], when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young\'s song.

He was part owner of [[Lionel, LLC]], a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |first= Michael|last= Brick|title= Clanging New York Subways, Screeches Intact, Go Miniature|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/nyregion/21train.html|work= N.Y. / Region|publisher= The New York Times|date= September 21, 2006|accessdate= 2008-11-10}}</ref> In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out.

Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba\'s highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the [[Order of Manitoba]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada\'s second highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]].

\'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ |title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists |publisher=Rollingstone.com |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada\'s Walk of Fame]].<ref name="cwof">{{cite web

In 2006, when \'\'[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]\'\' magazine compiled a "Greatest Living Songwriters" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other\'s records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on \'\'[[VH1]]\'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock\'\' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has "avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young\'s peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill."<ref name="rockhall.com"/>

Young\'s political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as "the Godfather of [[Grunge]]" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young\'s. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought \'\'[[After the Gold Rush]]\'\' (1970), and "immediately fell in love" with his work, calling it "extraordinary".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke|title=BBC documentary Neil Young: Don\'t Be Denied \xe2\x80\x93 Thom Yorke interviews}}</ref> [[Dave Matthews]] lists Young as one of his favorite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band [[The Bluetones]] named their number one [[Expecting to Fly (album)|debut album]] after the song "[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who covered "[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]" on the live album \'\'[[Familiar to Millions]]\'\' (2000).

The Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young\'s song "[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]" from \'\'[[Rust Never Sleeps]]\'\' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Pitchfork: Interviews: The Constantines |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=October 16, 2005 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref> While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young\'s former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Young\'s first songs were composed.

Jason Bond, an [[East Carolina University]] biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it \'\'[[Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi]]\'\' after Young,<ref name=bond2007>{{cite journal |author=[[Jason Bond|Jason E.

In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award by the civil liberties group [[People for the American Way]]. Young was honored as the [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] on January 29, 2010, two nights prior to the 52nd Annual [[Grammy Awards]]. He was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for "Fork in the Road" and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for \'\'[[The Archives Vol. 1 1963\xe2\x80\x931972|Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963\xe2\x80\x931972)]]\'\'. Young won the latter Grammy Award. In 2010, he was ranked No.&nbsp;26 in Gibson.com\'s Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-526/ |title=Top 50 Guitarists of All Time \xe2\x80\x93 30 to 21 |publisher=Gibson.com |accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref>

Clark was one of the earliest exponents of [[psychedelic rock]], [[baroque pop]], [[newgrass]], [[country rock]] and [[alternative country]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gene Clark was born in [[Tipton, Missouri]], the third of thirteen children in a family of Irish, German and Native American heritage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=2\xe2\x80\x934}}</ref> His family moved to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] where he began learning the [[steel-string acoustic guitar|guitar]] and harmonica from his father at a young age.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=23}}</ref> He was soon playing [[Hank Williams]] tunes as well as material by early rockers such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Everly Brothers]]. He began writing his own songs at age 11.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=24}}</ref> By the time he was 15 he had developed a rich tenor voice and he formed a local [[rock and roll]] combo, Joe Meyers and the Sharks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=25}}</ref> Like many of his generation, Clark developed an interest in [[folk music]] because of the popularity of the [[Kingston Trio]]. When he graduated from Bonner Springs High School in Bonner Springs, Kansas in 1962, Clark formed a folk group, the Rum Runners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=28}}</ref>

===Formation of The Byrds===
Clark was invited to join an established regional folk group, the Surf Riders working out of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] at the Castaways Lounge, owned by Hal Harbaum.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=29}}</ref> On August 12, 1963, he was performing with them when he was discovered by [[The New Christy Minstrels]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=31}}</ref> They hired him for their ensemble and he recorded two albums with them before leaving in early 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=33\xe2\x80\x9339}}</ref> After hearing [[the Beatles]], Clark quit the Christys and moved to Los Angeles where he met fellow folkie/Beatles convert [[Roger McGuinn|Jim (later Roger) McGuinn]] at the Troubadour Club. In early 1964 they began to assemble a band that would become The Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=44}}</ref>

Gene Clark wrote or co-wrote many of The Byrds\' best-known originals from their first three albums, including: "[[I\'ll Feel a Whole Lot Better]]", "[[Set You Free This Time]]", "Here Without You", "You Won\'t Have to Cry", "If You\'re Gone", "The World Turns All Around Her", "[[She Don\'t Care About Time]]" and "[[Eight Miles High]]". He and McGuinn also composed "[[You Showed Me]]", which was recorded but not released by the Byrds, and became a hit for the [[Turtles]] when they recorded it in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=50}}</ref> He initially played rhythm guitar in the band, but relinquished it to [[David Crosby]] and became the tambourine and harmonica player.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=50\xe2\x80\x9351}}</ref> Bassist [[Chris Hillman]] noted years later in various interviews remembering Gene: "At one time, he was the power in the Byrds, not McGuinn, not Crosby\xe2\x80\x94it was Gene who would burst through the stage curtain banging on a tambourine, coming on like a young Prince Valiant. A hero, our savior. Few in the audience could take their eyes off this presence. He \'\'was\'\' the songwriter. He had the "gift" that none of the rest of us had developed yet.... What deep inner part of his soul conjured up songs like "Set You Free This Time," "I\'ll  Feel A Whole Lot Better," "I\'m Feelin\' Higher," "Eight Miles High"? So many great songs! We learned a lot of songwriting from him and in the process learned a little bit about ourselves." <ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|pages=512\xe2\x80\x93513}}</ref>

A management decision delivered the lead vocal duties to McGuinn for their major singles and [[Bob Dylan]] songs. This disappointment, combined with Clark\'s dislike of traveling (including a chronic [[fear of flying]]) and resentment by other band members about the extra income he derived from his songwriting, led to internal squabbling and he left the group in early 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=88}}</ref> He briefly returned to Kansas City before moving back to Los Angeles to form Gene Clark & the Group with [[Chip Douglas]], [[Joel Larson]], and Bill Rhinehart.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=97\xe2\x80\x93109}}</ref>

===Solo career, brief return to The Byrds and Dillard & Clark===
[[Columbia Records]] (The Byrds\' record label) signed Clark as a solo artist and, in 1967, he released his first solo LP, \'\'[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]\'\'. The Gosdin Brothers were selected to back Gene because they shared manager Jim Dickson, and Chris Hillman, who played bass on the album, had worked with the Gosdin Brothers in the mid-1960s when he and they were members of the Southern California bluegrass band called [[The Hillmen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=113}}</ref> The album was a unique mixture of pop, country rock and baroque-psychedelic tracks. It received favorable reviews but unfortunately for Clark, it was released almost simultaneously with the Byrds\' \'\'[[Younger Than Yesterday]]\'\', also on Columbia, and (partly due to his 18-month-long public absence) was a commercial failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=116\xe2\x80\x93117}}</ref>

With the future of his solo career in doubt, Clark briefly rejoined [[The Byrds]] in October 1967, as a replacement for the recently departed David Crosby, but left after only three weeks, following an anxiety attack in Minneapolis.<ref name="einarson">{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=126\xe2\x80\x93127|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> During this brief period with The Byrds, he appeared with the band on the \'\'[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]\'\', miming to the group\'s current single "[[Goin\' Back]]", as well as to "[[Mr. Spaceman]]".<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hjort|page=148|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965\xe2\x80\x931973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref> Although there is some disagreement among the band\'s biographers, Clark is generally viewed as having contributed background vocals to the songs "Goin\' Back" and "Space Odyssey" from the then forthcoming Byrds\' album, \'\'[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]\'\', as well as being an uncredited co-author, with Roger McGuinn, of "Get to You" from that album.<ref name="einarson"/>

In 1968, Clark signed with [[A&M Records]] and began a collaboration with banjo player [[the Dillards|Doug Dillard]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=130}}</ref> Guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]] (later with [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]), bass player Dave Jackson and mandolin player Don Beck joined them to form the nucleus of Dillard & Clark.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=131}}</ref> They produced two albums: \'\'[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]](1968),\'\' and \'\'[[Through the Morning Through the Night]](1969).\'\'

\'\'The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark\'\' was an acoustic adventure into country rock and included songs like "Train Leaves Here This Morning", covered in 1972 on \'\'[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]\'\' and "She Darked the Sun", covered by [[Linda Ronstadt]] on her 1970 album, \'\'[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]\'\'. \'\'Through the Morning, Through the Night\'\' was more bluegrass in character than its predecessor, and used electric instrumentation. It also included Donna Washburn (Dillard\'s girlfriend) as a backing vocalist, which contributed to the departure of Leadon,<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=147}}</ref> and a change to a traditional bluegrass direction that caused Clark to lose interest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=149}}</ref> The Dillard & Clark song "Through The Morning Through The Night" was used in Quincy Jones\'s soundtrack of the 1972 [[Sam Peckinpah]] movie \'\'[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]\'\'.  This song, along with "Polly" (both from the second Dillard and Clark album), was also covered by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Alison Krauss]] on their 2007 album \'\'[[Raising Sand]]\'\'.  Both Dillard & Clark albums fared poorly on the charts, but they are now regarded as pioneers of country rock and newgrass genres.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=65}}</ref> 
 
The collaboration with Doug Dillard rejuvenated Clark\'s creativity but greatly contributed to his growing drinking problem.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=134}}</ref> Dillard & Clark disintegrated in late 1969 after the departures of Clark and Leadon. Clark, along with Leadon, Jackson and Beck provided backup on the debut album of [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], \'\'[[Rock Salt & Nails (album)|Rock Salt & Nails]],\'\' released November 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock\'s Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock|year=2003|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-743-9|page=191}}</ref>

In 1970, Clark began work on a new single, recording two tracks with the original members of the Byrds (each recording his part separately). The resulting songs, "She\'s the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred", were not released at the time due to legal problems and were included later on \'\'[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=161\xe2\x80\x93162}}</ref> In 1970 and 1971, Clark contributed vocals and two compositions ("Tried So Hard" and "Here Tonight") to albums by the Flying Burrito Brothers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=164}}</ref>

Frustrated with the music industry, Clark bought a home at [[Albion, California|Albion]] near [[Mendocino, California]], married a woman named Carlie and fathered two sons (Kelly and Kai) while subsisting in semiretirement on his still-substantial Byrds royalties throughout the early 1970s; these were ballasted by [[The Turtles]]\' 1969 American Top Ten hit "[[You Showed Me]]", a hitherto unreleased McGuinn-Clark composition from 1964.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-9529540-1-X|page=487}}</ref><ref>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-turtles-mn0000564239/awards</ref>

===\'\'White Light\'\' and \'\'Roadmaster\'\'===
In 1971, Gene Clark released his second solo album. It was titled \'\'[[White Light (Gene Clark album)|White Light]]\'\', although the fact that the name was not included on the cover sleeve led some later reviewers to assume mistakenly that it was titled \'Gene Clark\'.<ref name="Einarson 2005 167">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=167}}</ref> The album was produced by the much sought after [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] guitarist [[Jesse Ed Davis]] with whom Clark developed great rapport, partly due to their common Indian ancestry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=4}}</ref> An intimate, poetic and mostly acoustic work supplemented by Davis\' slide guitar, the album contained many introspective tracks such as "With Tomorrow", "Because of You", "Where My Love Lies Asleep" and "For a Spanish Guitar" (which Bob Dylan supposedly hailed as one of the greatest songs ever written).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-471-73173-0|page=157}}</ref> All of the material was written by Clark, with the exception of the Dylan and [[Richard Manuel]] composition, "[[Tears of Rage]]". Launched to considerable critical acclaim, the LP failed to gain commercial success, except in the Netherlands where it was also voted album of the year by rock music critics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=168}}</ref> Once more, modest promotion and Clark\'s refusal to undertake promotional touring adversely affected sales.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=486}}</ref>

In the spring of 1971, Clark was commissioned by [[Dennis Hopper]] to contribute the tracks "American Dreamer" and "Outlaw Song" to Hopper\'s film project \'\'American Dreamer\'\'.<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/> A re-recorded, longer version of the song "American Dreamer" was later used in the 1977 film \'\'The Farmer\'\', along with an instrumental version of the same song plus "Outside the Law (The Outlaw)" (a re-recording of "Outlaw Song").<ref name="Einarson 2005 167"/>

In 1972, Clark assembled a backing group consisting of highly accomplished country rock musicians to accompany him on an album with A&M. Progress was slow and expensive and A&M terminated the project before completion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=176}}</ref> The resulting eight tracks, including "Full Circle Song" and "In a Misty Morning" were added to those recorded with The Byrds in 1970/71 ("She\'s the Kind of Girl" and "One in a Hundred") and with The Flying Burrito Brothers ("Here Tonight"), and released in 1973 as \'\'[[Roadmaster (album)|Roadmaster]]\'\' in the Netherlands only.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=487}}</ref>

===\'\'Byrds\'\'===
Clark then left A&M to join the reunion of the original five Byrds and cut the album \'\'[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]\'\' (released in 1973) which charted well (US # 20). Clark\'s compositions "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]" and "Changing Heart" plus the [[Neil Young]] covers on which he did the lead vocal work ("See the Sky About to Rain" and "Cowgirl in the Sand") were widely regarded as the standout tracks on a record which received some negative critical response.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182">{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=182}}</ref> Disheartened by the bad reviews and unhappy with David Crosby\'s performance as the record\'s producer, the group members chose to dissolve The Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=354}}</ref> Clark briefly joined McGuinn\'s solo group, with which he premiered "Silver Raven", arguably his most celebrated post-Byrds song.<ref name="Einarson 2005 182"/>

===\'\'No Other\'\'===
On the basis of the quality of Clark\'s \'\'Byrds\'\' contributions, [[David Geffen]] signed him to [[Asylum Records]] in early 1974.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=369}}</ref> Asylum was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn\'t experienced since his days with The Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Hotel California: The True Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles and Their Many Friends|year=2006|publisher=Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=140}}</ref> He retired to Mendocino and spent long periods at the picture window of a friend\'s cliff-top home with a notebook and acoustic guitar in hand, staring at the Pacific Ocean. Deeply affected by his visions, he composed the songs that became his masterpiece, \'\'[[No Other]]\'\'. Produced by [[Thomas Jefferson Kaye]] with a vast array of session musicians and backing singers, the album was an extraordinary amalgam of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=488}}</ref> Included in \'\'No Other\'\' are some of Clark\'s best compositions including "Silver Raven", "No Other", "Some Misunderstanding" and "Lady of the North". The album was praised by critics but the fact that \'\'No Other\'\' wasn\'t a conventional pop/rock opus limited public appeal.  Furthermore, its production costs of $100,000 which yielded only eight tracks prompted Geffen to berate Clark and Kaye.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=192}}</ref> The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the charts at No.&nbsp;144.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=193}}</ref> Ultimately, \'\'No Other\'\' became a favorite of rock critics, growing in popularity with each passing year.<ref name="Rogan 2008 370">{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=370}}</ref> In 2013, popularity of \'\'No Other\'\' arguably reached a fever pitch when it was revealed that members of Beach House, The Walkmen, Grizzly Bear, and Fleet Foxes among others would be performing the album in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/53198-beach-house-fleet-foxes-walkmen-grizzly-bear-members-to-perform-gene-clarks-no-other-on-tour/ |title=Beach House, Fleet Foxes, Walkmen, Grizzly Bear Members to Perform Gene Clark\'s No Other on Tour &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=December 3, 2013 |accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>

Clark\'s return to Los Angeles to record the album resulted in his reversion to a hedonistic lifestyle and facilitated the disintegration of his marriage.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=189}}</ref> Disillusioned by professional and marital failure, he mounted his first solo tour (by road), playing colleges and clubs with backing group, the Silverados.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=194}}</ref>

===\'\'Two Sides to Every Story\'\'===
After the commercial failure of No Other, Clark was confused about his artistic direction.  Throughout 1975 and 1976, he had hinted to the press that he was assembling a set of "cosmic" songs fusing country-rock with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk]], elaborating on the soundscapes of \'\'[[No Other]]\'\'. In 1976, he recorded a set of ten demos that combined country and folk music with a light touch of cosmic consciousness. These were submitted to [[RSO Records]], who promptly bought out Clark\'s Asylum contract. In 1977, Gene Clark released his RSO Records debut entitled \'\'[[Two Sides to Every Story]]\'\'. Once again, Thomas Jefferson Kaye produced it, but with a much more understated hand.<ref name="Rogan 2008 370"/>

The emotional fallout from his divorce is reflected in the album title and several of Clark\'s compositions: "Sister Moon", "Lonely Saturday", "Past Addresses", "Silent Crusade" and "Hear the Wind". The album also contains impressive covers of the traditional "In the Pines" and "Give My Love to Marie" by [[James Talley]]. Once again, his style of sensitive country-rock balladry failed to achieve US chart success. In a belated attempt to find an appreciative public, he temporarily overcame his travel anxiety and launched an international promotional tour with the KC Southern Band.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|pages=490\xe2\x80\x93491}}</ref> Some six weeks before his death, Clark told interviewer Bill Wasserzieher that he considered \'\'[[Two Sides to Every Story]]\'\' his best album, rivaled only by \'\'[[No Other]]\'\'.<ref>Wasserzieher, Bill. In Memoriam: The Byrds\' Gene Clark (1944\xe2\x80\x931991). www.rocksbackpages.com, September 1991.</ref>

===\'\'McGuinn, Clark & Hillman\'\'===
For his British tour dates, Clark found himself on the same bill as ex-Byrds [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Chris Hillman]], each fronting their own bands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=372}}</ref> After returning to the United States, Clark and McGuinn began touring as an acoustic duo. Eventually Hillman agreed to join them and the three signed with [[Capitol Records]] which released their self-titled debut in 1979.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=382}}</ref> \'\'McGuinn, Clark & Hillman\'\' was a rebirth in both performing and songwriting for Clark. He wrote four songs for the album: "Backstage Pass", "Release me Girl", "Feelin\' Higher" and "Little Mama".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|pages=385\xe2\x80\x93387}}</ref>

Many critics felt that the album\'s slick production and [[disco]] rhythms didn\'t flatter the group, but the album reached Number 39 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] and sold well enough to generate a follow up. McGuinn, Clark and Hillman\'s second release was to have been a full group effort entitled \'\'City\'\', but a combination of Clark\'s unreliability and his dissatisfaction with their musical direction (mostly regarding Ron and Howard Albert\'s production) resulted in the billing change on \'\'City\'\' to "Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, featuring Gene Clark," released in 1980. Despite the turmoil, Clark penned a classic love song, "Won\'t Let You Down". By 1981, Clark had left, and the group recorded one more album as "McGuinn/Hillman".<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=227\xe2\x80\x93231}}</ref>

===Rehabilitation, \'\'Firebyrd\'\', and \'\'So Rebellious a Lover\'\'===
Clark moved to Hawaii with Jesse Ed Davis to try to overcome his drug dependency, remaining there until the end of 1981.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited The Sequel|year=2008|publisher=Rogan House|location=London England|isbn=0-95295-401-X|page=492}}</ref> Upon his return to L.A., he assembled a new band, the Firebyrds, and, in 1982, proceeded to record what would eventually become the album \'\'Firebyrd\'\'. While waiting for \'\'Firebyrd\'\' to be released, Clark joined up with Chris Hillman and others in an abortive venture called Flyte which failed to secure a recording contract and was quickly dissolved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=239\xe2\x80\x93242}}</ref> \'\'Firebyrd\'s\'\' eventual release in 1984 coincided with the emergence of jangle rockers like [[R.E.M.]] and [[Tom Petty]] who had sparked a new interest in the Byrds. Clark began developing new fans among [[Los Angeles|L.A.]]\'s roots-conscious [[Paisley Underground]] scene.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds\' Gene Clark.|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco CA|isbn=0-87930-793-5|pages=250\xe2\x80\x93251}}</ref> Later in the decade, he embraced his new status by appearing as a guest with [[The Long Ryders]], in a session arranged by album producer [[Henry Lewy]] at band member [[Sid Griffin]]\'s suggestion, and by cutting an acclaimed duo album with [[Carla Olson]] of the [[Textones]] titled \'\'So Rebellious a Lover\'\' in 1986, which was produced and arranged by noted session drummer, [[Michael Huey]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-huey-p88388/credits Michael Huey]</ref> A few of the album\'s compositions ranked with Gene\'s best: Gypsy Rider and Del Gato.

===Later career, illness and death===
In 1985 Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman 1984 regarding a reformation of The Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v. Byrds: The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds 1984\xe2\x80\x931988|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spname1.html|accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> The three of them showed no interest. Clark decided to assemble a "[[superstar]]" collection of musicians, including ex-[[Flying Burrito Brothers]] member [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], ex-[[Beach Boys]] singer/guitarist [[Blondie Chaplin]], [[Rick Danko]] and [[Richard Manuel]] of [[The Band]], with ex-Byrds Michael Clarke and [[John York (musician)|John York]]. Clark initially called his band "The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds" and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=255|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds\' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> A number of [[Tour promoter|concert promoters]] began to shorten the band\'s name to "The Byrds" in advertisements and promotional material.<ref name="byrdwatcher12"/> As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten their name to "The Byrds" permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own "Byrds" band, but drummer Michael Clarke then continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally using ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons, also), forming another "Byrds" group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby into going on the road as "The Byrds" to attempt to establish claim to the rights to the band name. Their effort failed at the time, and Gene Clark, primarily due to his involvement with the act that didn\'t include them, was not included in their reunion. David Crosby finally secured rights to the band name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>

In 1987 \'\'So Rebellious a Lover\'\'  became a modest commercial success but Clark began to develop serious health problems; he had ulcers, aggravated by years of heavy drinking (often used to alleviate his chronic travel anxiety). In 1988 he underwent surgery during which much of his stomach and intestines had to be removed.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

A period of abstinence and recovery followed until [[Tom Petty]]\'s cover of "I\'ll Feel a Whole Lot Better" on his 1989 album \'\'[[Full Moon Fever]]\'\' yielded a huge amount of royalty money to Clark who quickly reverted to drug and alcohol abuse. The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1991, where the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark\'s "I\'ll Feel a Whole Lot Better".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

However, Clark\'s health continued to decline as his drinking accelerated. He died of natural causes on May 24, 1991 at age 46. The coroner declared he succumbed as a result of "natural causes" brought on by a bleeding ulcer. He was buried at Saint Andrews Cemetery in Tipton under a simple headstone inscribed "Harold Eugene Clark \xe2\x80\x93 No Other."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=10074 |title=Gene Clark (1944\xe2\x80\x931991) \xe2\x80\x93 Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=www.findagrave.com |accessdate=2010-12-18 }}</ref>

In 2013 a documentary about Gene\'s life and career entitled "The Byrd Who Flew Alone" was released featuring contributions from family, friends and the three surviving original members of The Byrds as well as latter-day Byrd John York. In this documentary it is revealed that Clark was suffering from throat cancer at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foursunsproductions.com/Gene-Clark-Documentary/ |title="The Byrd Who Flew Alone: The Triumphs And Tragedy Of Gene Clark" Documentary |publisher=www.foursunsproductions.com |accessdate=2013-10-30 }}</ref>

In the 1980s Earle returned to Nashville once again and worked as a songwriter for the publishers Roy Dea and Pat Carter. A song he co-wrote, "When You Fall in Love", was recorded by [[Johnny Lee (singer)|Johnny Lee]] and made number 14 on the country charts in 1982.<ref name="CMT"/> [[Carl Perkins]] recorded Earle\'s song "Mustang Wine", and two of his songs were recorded by [[Zella Lehr]]. Later Dea and Carter created an independent record label called \'\'LSI\'\' and invited Earle to began recording his own material on their label.<ref name="All Music"/>

Earle released an EP called, \'\'Pink & Black\'\', in 1982 featuring the \'\'Dukes\'\'.

His 1990 album \'\'[[The Hard Way (Steve Earle album)|The Hard Way]]\'\'<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/> had a strong rock sound and was followed by "a shoddy live album" called \'\'Shut Up and Die Like An Aviator\'\'.<ref name="CMT"/><ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/> In August 1991 Earle appeared on the TV show \'\'The Texas Connection\'\' "looking pale and blown out".<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/>  In light of Earle\'s "increasing drug use" MCA Records did not renew his contract and Earle didn\'t record any music for the next four years.<ref name="CMT"/> By July 1993 Earle was reported to have regained his normal weight and had started to write new material.<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993"/> At that time a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times called Earle "a visionary symbol of the New Traditionalist movement in country music."<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times 1993">Hoekstra, Dave (July 11, 1993) "Steve Earle On the Road To Comeback", Chicago Sun-Times</ref>

In 1994, two staff members at [[Warner/Chappell]] publishing company, and Earle\'s former manager, John Dotson, created an in-house CD of Earle\'s songs entitled \'\'Uncut Gems\'\' and showcased it to some recording artists in Nashville.  This resulted in several of Earle\'s songs being recorded by Travis Tritt, [[Stacy Dean Campbell]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]].<ref name="CMT"/> After his recording hiatus, Earle released \'\'[[Train a Comin\']]\'\' on Winter Harvest Records and it was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]] in 1996. The album was characterized as a return to the "folksy acoustic" sound of his early career.<ref name="CMT"/> In 1996 Earle formed his own record label, [[E-Squared Records]], and released the album, \'\'I Feel Alright\'\', which combined the musical sounds of country, rock and rockabilly.<ref name="CMT"/> Earle released the album \'\'[[El Corazon]]\'\' (The Heart) in 1997 which one reviewer called "the capstone of this [Earle\'s] remarkable comeback".<ref>Warren, Doug (November 20, 2007) "Steve Earle: El Corozon E-Squared/Warner Bros"., \'\'[[The Boston Globe]]\'\' (Boston, MA)</ref>

She has worked with numerous leading artists including [[Gram Parsons]], [[John Denver]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[The Band]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[John Prine]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Steve Earle]], and [[Ryan Adams]].<!-- The preceding is not a laundry list. Please be judicious in making additions. -->

==Biography==

=== Early years ===
Harris is from a [[Military brat (US subculture)|career military family]]. Her father, Walter Harris, was a military officer and her mother Eugenia was a wartime military wife. Her father, a member of the [[Marine Corps]], was reported missing in action in [[Korea]] in 1952 and spent ten months as a prisoner of war. Born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Harris spent her childhood in [[North Carolina]] and [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], where she graduated from [[Gar-Field Senior High School]] as class [[valedictorian]]. She won a drama scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], where she began to study music seriously, learning to play the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]] on guitar.  She dropped out of college to pursue her musical aspirations, and moved to New York City, working as a waitress to support herself while performing folk songs in [[Greenwich Village]] [[coffeehouse]]s during the folkie boom.<ref name = "People-Arrington-1982-11-15"/> She married fellow songwriter Tom Slocum in 1969 and recorded her first album, \'\'[[Gliding Bird]]\'\'.  Harris and Slocum soon divorced, and Harris and her newborn daughter Hallie moved in with her parents in the [[Maryland]] suburbs near Washington, D.C.<ref name = "People-Arrington-1982-11-15"/><ref>"Charlie Rose Show" June 25, 2008</ref>

=== With Gram Parsons ===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2012}}

Harris soon returned to performing as part of a trio with Gerry Mule and Tom Guidera. In 1971, members of the [[country rock]] group [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] saw her perform; former [[The Byrds|Byrds]] member [[Chris Hillman]] had taken over the band after the departure of founder [[Gram Parsons]], was impressed by Harris, and briefly considered asking her to join the Flying Burrito Brothers. Instead, Hillman recommended her to Parsons, who was looking for a female vocalist to collaborate with on his first solo album, \'\'[[GP (album)|GP]]\'\'. Harris toured as a member of Parsons\'s band, The Fallen Angels in 1973, and the two of them shone during vocal harmonies and duets. Later that year, Parsons and Harris worked on a studio album, \'\'[[Grievous Angel]]\'\'. Parsons died in his motel room near what is now [[Joshua Tree National Park]] on September 19, 1973 from an accidental overdose of drugs and alcohol. Parsons\' \'\'Grievous Angel\'\' was released [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1974, and three more tracks from his sessions with Harris were included on another posthumous Parsons album, \'\'[[Sleepless Nights (Gram Parsons album)|Sleepless Nights]]\'\', in 1976. There was one more album of recorded material from that period that was packaged with the name, \'\'[[Live 1973]]\'\', but was not released until 1982.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

Parsons offered Harris a study in country music, introducing her to [[the Louvin Brothers]], and provided her with a musical identity. Harris\' harmony and duet vocals, on the other hand, were lauded by those who heard them, and helped inspire Parsons\' performances. His death left her devastated at an emotional and musical crossroads. She eventually carried on with her own version of Parsons\' musical vision, and was instrumental in bringing attention to his achievements. Harris\'s earliest signature song, "[[Boulder to Birmingham]]", written shortly after Parsons\'s death, showed the depth of her shock and pain at losing Parsons. It was, according to best friend [[Linda Ronstadt]], the beginning of a "lifetime effort to process what had happened", and was the first of many songs written and/or performed by Harris about her life with (and without) Parsons.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} <!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

===The Hot Band===

[[File:JamesBurton(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hot Band member [[James Burton]]]]
[[Warner Brothers]] A&R representative Mary Martin introduced Harris to Canadian producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]], who produced her [[major label]] debut album, \'\'[[Pieces of the Sky]]\'\', released in 1975 on [[Reprise Records]]. The album was surprisingly eclectic, especially by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] standards, including [[cover versions]] of [[the Beatles]]\' "[[For No One]]", [[Merle Haggard]]\'s "Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down" and [[the Louvin Brothers]]\' "[[If I Could Only Win Your Love]]".  It also featured "Bluebird Wine", a composition by young [[Texas]] songwriter [[Rodney Crowell]], who was the first in a long line of songwriters whose talents Harris has championed.  The record was one of the most expensive country records produced at the time, featuring the talents of [[James Burton]], [[Glen Hardin]], [[Ron Tutt]], [[Ray Pohlman]], and [[Bill Payne]], as well as two tracks ("Before Believing" and "Queen of the Silver Dollar") that were cut with the Angel Band. Two singles were released: "Too Far Gone", which initially charted at No.&nbsp;73 (a 1979 reissue hit No.&nbsp;13), and Harris\'s first big hit, "If I Could Only Win Your Love", a duet with [[Herb Pedersen]] (later a founding member of [[the Desert Rose Band]]), which peaked at No.&nbsp;4.

Executives of [[Warner Bros. Records]] (Reprise Records\'s parent company) told Harris they would agree to record her if she would "get a hot band". Harris did so, enlisting guitarist [[James Burton]] and pianist [[Glen Hardin]], both of whom had played with [[Elvis Presley]] as well as Parsons. Burton was a renowned guitarist, starting in [[Ricky Nelson]]\'s band in the 1950s, and Hardin had been a member of [[the Crickets]]. Other Hot Band members were drummer John Ware, [[pedal steel]] guitarist Hank DeVito, and bassist [[Emory Gordy, Jr.]], with whom Harris had worked while performing with Parsons.  Singer-songwriter [[Rodney Crowell|Crowell]] was enlisted as a rhythm guitarist and duet partner.<ref name="Hot Band">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmylou.net/hotband.html |title=The Hot Band |publisher=Emmylou.net |date=April 3, 1975 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> Harris\'s first tour schedule originally dovetailed around Presley\'s, owing to Burton and Hardin\'s continuing commitments to Presley\'s band. The Hot Band lived up to its name, with most of the members moving on with fresh talent replacing them as they continued on to solo careers of their own.

\'\'[[Elite Hotel]]\'\', released in December 1975, established that the buzz created by \'\'Pieces of the Sky\'\' was well-founded.  Unusual for country albums at the time, which largely revolved around a hit single, Harris\'s albums borrowed their approach from the album-oriented rock market. In terms of quality and artistic merit, tracks like "Sin City", "Wheels", and "Till I Gain Control Again", which weren\'t singles, easily stood against tracks like "[[Together Again (Buck Owens song)|Together Again]]", "[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]", and "One of These Days", which were.  While \'\'Elite Hotel\'\' was a No.&nbsp;1 country album, the album did sufficiently well as a crossover success with the rock audience.  Harris appealed to those who normally disapproved of the country market\'s pull toward crossover pop singles ("Together Again" and "Sweet Dreams" both topped the country charts).  \'\'Elite Hotel\'\' won a [[Grammy]] in 1976 for [[Best Country Vocal Performance, Female]].

Harris\'s reputation for guest work continued.  Aside from contributing to albums by [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Guy Clark]] and [[Neil Young]], Harris was tapped by [[Bob Dylan]] to perform on his \'\'[[Desire (Bob Dylan album)|Desire]]\'\' album.  Harris also filmed one of the studio sequences, owing to her touring schedule, in [[the Band]]\'s \'\'[[The Last Waltz]]\'\', singing "Evangeline".

Burton left the Hot Band in 1976, choosing to remain with Elvis Presley\'s band, and was replaced by English guitarist [[Albert Lee]].  Harris\'s commercial apex was \'\'[[Luxury Liner (album)|Luxury Liner]]\'\', released in 1977, which remains one of her definitive records.  On \'\'Luxury Liner\'\', Harris\'s mix of songs from [[Chuck Berry]] ("(You Never Can Tell) C\'est La Vie"), [[Gram Parsons]] (the title track and "She"), [[the Carter Family]] ("Hello Stranger") and [[Kitty Wells]] ("[[Making Believe]]") illustrate a continuity and artistic merit to country music often overlooked at the time. Even so, many fans expected more original tunes, so she became known as a cover artist.  Despite Top Ten singles with "C\'est La Vie" and "Making Believe", the album\'s best known track is the first recorded cover of [[Townes Van Zandt]]\'s classic "[[Pancho & Lefty]]", which would be a No.&nbsp;1 hit for [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]] in 1983.  At the end of 1977, Crowell left the Hot Band to pursue a solo career; his replacement was [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] multi-instrumentalist and singer [[Ricky Skaggs]].

\'\'[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]\'\' signaled a slight change of direction from Harris\'s previous three albums.  Rather than mixing classic and contemporary, the album is made up largely of recently written songs, though from a wide variety of writers.  "Two More Bottles of Wine", written by [[Delbert McClinton]], became Harris\'s third No.&nbsp;1 single, "[[To Daddy]]", written by [[Dolly Parton]], went to No.&nbsp;3, and a third single, "Easy From Now On", went Top Twenty.  The album included two songs apiece from Crowell ("I Ain\'t Living Long Like This" and "Leaving Louisiana in the Broad Daylight") and songwriter [[Jesse Winchester]] ("Defying Gravity" and "My Songbird"), and [[Utah Phillips]]\' "Green Rolling Hills".

===The Roots records===
In January 1977, Harris married Brian Ahern.<ref name = "People-Arrington-1982-11-15">
{{cite news | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20083549,00.html  | date = November 15, 1982  | issue = Vol. 18 No. 20 | title = Singer Emmylou Harris and Producer Brian Ahern Make (and Record) Beautiful Music Together | first = Carl  | last = Arrington | work = People Magazine  | accessdate = August 7, 2013  }}</ref> 
Their (Harris\'s second and also Ahern\'s second) daughter, Meghann, was born in 1979.  During this period, Harris recorded and released three studio albums that reflected a shift toward traditional country (during a time that the public was beginning to embrace a more polished \'\'[[Urban Cowboy]]\'\' sound).  The roots direction was prominent in her [[Grammy Award]]-winning 1979 album \'\'[[Blue Kentucky Girl (Emmylou Harris album)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]\'\'.  Apart from a cover of [[the Drifters]]\' "[[Save The Last Dance For Me]]", the album was largely made up of classic-styled country material in the vein of [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Kitty Wells]].  One of her best-loved albums, it includes songs from [[the Louvin Brothers]]\' "Everytime You Leave", [[Willie Nelson]]\'s "Sister\'s Coming Home" and [[Gram Parson]]\'s signature "Hickory Wind".  [[Wesley Rose]] took special interest in Harris\' recording of "Beneath Still Waters", which became a No.&nbsp;1 hit.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

A Christmas album, \'\'[[Light of the Stable (album)|Light of the Stable]]\'\', was released in 1979; its title track featured backing vocals by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Neil Young]], all three of whom Harris had worked with sporadically since the mid-1970s, and with whom she continued to collaborate with through the 2000s. (Harris, Parton and Ronstadt began working on a trio album during this time, though it remained unfinished for nearly a decade; a few of the tracks recorded for the project were released on the women\'s respective solo albums in the interim.) The album is largely acoustic, featuring readings of traditional fare such as "Silent Night", "O Little Town of Bethlehem" and "The First Noel".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

In the 1980s, Harris explored country music\'s history further with the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-oriented recording of \'\'[[Roses in the Snow]]\'\', featuring [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Tony Rice]], [[Albert Lee]], [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]].  Harris\'s versions of the traditional "[[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|Wayfaring Stranger]]" and [[Paul Simon]]\'s "[[The Boxer]]" were strong singles.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

In 1980, Harris recorded "That Lovin\' You Feelin\' Again" with [[Roy Orbison]].  The duet\'s recordings was a Top-10 hit on both the Country and Adult Contemporary charts. They were awarded a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]].  She was featured on [[Paul Kennerley]]\'s concept album \'\'[[The Legend of Jesse James]]\'\', which also featured [[Levon Helm]] of [[the Band]] and [[Johnny Cash]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}<!-- sources for entire paragraph needed-->

===Pop-chart success, songwriting===
In 1981, Harris\'s recordings reached the Top 40 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]] with a cover of "[[Mister Sandman]]"\xe2\x80\x94again Top 10 Country as well as Adult Contemporary\xe2\x80\x94from her \'\'[[Evangeline (Emmylou Harris album)|Evangeline]]\'\' album. (The album version of the song was a track from the  \'\'Trio\'\' sessions with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], but neither Parton\'s nor Ronstadt\'s [[Record industry|record companies]] would allow their artists\' vocals to be used on the single, so Harris re-recorded the song, singing all three parts for the [[Single (music)|single release]] of the song.){{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Harris moved to [[Nashville]] in 1982. \'\'[[White Shoes]]\'\' in 1983 included an eclectic pairing of the rockish reading of "[[Diamonds Are a Girl\'s Best Friend]]" with a remake of the [[Donna Summer]] hit "On the Radio", as well as tracks from a diverse group of songwriters including Hot Band member Crowell, [[Sandy Denny]] and [[T-Bone Burnett]]. It was her last album produced by Brian Ahern until \'\'[[All I Intended to Be]]\'\' in 2008.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Harris\'s major-label releases thus far included few of her own songs, but in 1985 her songwriting skills were prominent with the release of a concept album \'\'[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]\'\', for which she co-wrote all of the songs. The album was semi-autobiographical, based loosely on her relationship with Parsons. Harris described it as a "country opera", and a "huge commercial disaster".<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Questionnaire/emmylou_harris |  author=Keast, James |  work=Exclaim.ca | date = June 2008 | title= Questionnaire: Emmylou Harris | accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> 
Her co-writer and producer on the album, English songwriter and musician [[Paul Kennerley]], the writer of the hit singles "Born to Run" (on Harris\'s 1981 \'\'[[Cimarron (Emmylou Harris album)|Cimarron]]\'\' album) and "In My Dreams" (on \'\'White Shoes\'\'). Kennerley also produced her next album, \'\'[[Thirteen (Emmylou Harris album)|Thirteen]]\'\'. They married in 1985 and divorced in 1993.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1987, nearly a full decade after their first attempt, Harris teamed up with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt for a long-promised and long-anticipated \'\'[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]\'\' disc.  The album was the biggest commercial success of Harris\'s career, spending five weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on Billboard\'s Country Albums chart (also quickly reaching the Top 10 on the Pop Albums chart). It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 Country hits, including "[[To Know Him Is To Love Him]]", which hit No.&nbsp;1. The recording was nominated for the coveted [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Grammy award (given to [[U2]] that year for \'\'[[The Joshua Tree]]\'\') and the three women won the statuette for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; the album\'s [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]]-penned track "[[Telling Me Lies]]" reached No.&nbsp;3 Country, No.&nbsp;25 Adult Contemporary, and was nominated for a Grammy as 1987\'s [[Best Country Song]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Harris also released a solo album in 1987, \'\'[[Angel Band (album)|Angel Band]]\'\', featuring traditional [[Gospel music|gospel songs]], on which she worked with then rising country star [[Vince Gill]], and others.  In 1989, she recorded two songs with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album, \'\'[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume II]]\'\'. In a snippet of studio chatter included on one of the tracks, she talked during the recording session about her beginnings and how music had changed:{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

{{quote|Years ago I had the experience of sitting around in a living room with a bunch of people and singing and playing, and it was like a spiritual experience, it was wonderful. And I decided then that was what I was going to do with my life was play music, do music. In the making of records, I think over the years we\'ve all gotten a little too technical, a little too hung up on getting things perfect. We\'ve lost the living room. The living room has gone out of the music, but today I feel like we got it back.}}

1989\'s \'\'[[Bluebird (album)|Bluebird]]\'\' album, which featured contributions from [[Marty Stuart]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], included the singles "[[Heartbreak Hill (song)|Heartbreak Hill]]", which reached No.&nbsp;8 on the U.S. country singles chart, and "[[Heaven Only Knows (Emmylou Harris song)|Heaven Only Knows]]", which reached No.&nbsp;16, the most recent top-twenty chart singles of Harris\' career.  The following year\'s \'\'[[Brand New Dance]]\'\' album received favorable reviews, but marked the beginning of a chart and airplay decline for Harris.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Around 1991, she dissolved The Hot Band and formed a new band of acoustic musicians\xe2\x80\x94[[Sam Bush]] on fiddle, mandolin and vocals, [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]] on bass and vocals, Larry Atamanuik on drums, [[Al Perkins]] on banjo, guitar, [[Dobro]] guitar and vocals, and [[Jon Randall]] on guitar, mandolin and vocals\xe2\x80\x94which she named The Nash Ramblers. They recorded a [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[At the Ryman|live album]] in 1992 at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which led to the $8 million restoration of the facility into a premium concert and event venue. It was her last album with [[Reprise Records]].  She has been a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] since 1992.<ref>

===New directions===
<!--  Commented out: [[File:NeilYoungHeartOfGoldfilmsti.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Emmylou Harris, left, performing with Neil and Pegi Young in \'\'Neil Young: Heart of Gold\'\'.]] -->
By the 1990s, Harris started receiving less airplay as mainstream country stations began shifting their focus to the youth-oriented "new country" format. As with \'\'Brand New Dance\'\', 1993\'s \'\'[[Cowgirl\'s Prayer]]\'\'\xe2\x80\x94Harris\' first studio album after her switch to [[Elektra Records]]\xe2\x80\x94was critically praised but received very little airplay,<ref name="Cromelin1996">{{cite web|author=Cromelin, Richard |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-11/entertainment/ca-57283_1_emmylou-harris |title=Q & A with EMMYLOU HARRIS: Singing With a Voice That\'s Always True to Her Heart |date=April 11, 1996 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> and its lead single, "High Powered Love" charted very low, peaking at No.&nbsp;63, prompting her to shift her career in a new direction.

In 1995, Harris released one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the decade, \'\'[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]\'\', produced by [[Daniel Lanois]], best known for his work with [[U2]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. An experimental album for Harris, the record included Harris\'s rendition of the [[Neil Young]]-penned title track (Young himself provided guest vocals on two of the album\'s songs), [[Steve Earle]]\'s "Goodbye", [[Julie Miller]]\'s "All My Tears", [[Jimi Hendrix]]\'s "May This Be Love", [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]]\'s "Goin\' Back to Harlan" and [[Gillian Welch]]\'s "Orphan Girl". U2\'s [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] showed up to play drums for the project.  The album received virtually no country airplay whatsoever, but did bring Harris to the attention of [[alternative rock]] listeners, many of whom had never listened to her music before.

Harris then took her \'\'Wrecking Ball\'\' material on the road, releasing the live \'\'[[Spyboy (album)|Spyboy]]\'\' in 1998, backed with a [[power trio]] comprising Nashville producer, songwriter and guitarist [[Buddy Miller]] and [[New Orleans]] musicians, drummer [[Brady Blade]] and bassist-vocalist-percussionist Daryl Johnson. In addition to performing songs from \'\'Wrecking Ball\'\', the album updated many of Harris\'s career hits, including "Boulder to Birmingham".

Also in 1998, she appeared prominently on [[Willie Nelson]]\'s moody, instrumentally sparse \'\'[[Teatro (Willie Nelson album)|Teatro]]\'\' album, produced by \'\'Wrecking Ball\'\' producer Lanois.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/05/entertainment/ca-19591 |title=Willie Nelson, "Teatro," Island. |author=Cromelin, Richard |date=September 5, 1998 |accessdate=May 15, 2011 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

During the summer of 1997 and 1998, Harris joined [[Sarah McLachlan]]\'s all-woman musical touring festival, the [[Lilith Fair]], where new artists like [[Patty Griffin]] could share new experiences and ideas with seasoned musicians like Harris and [[Bonnie Raitt]].

In January 1999, Harris released \'\'[[Trio 2 (album)|Trio 2]]\'\' with Parton and Ronstadt. Much of the album had actually been recorded in 1994, but remained unreleased for nearly five years because of record label and personnel disputes, conflicting schedules, and career priorities of the three artists. \'\'Trio 2\'\' was much more contemporary-sounding than its predecessor and was certified Gold. It included their version of Neil Young\'s classic "After The Gold Rush", which became a popular music video and won another Grammy\xe2\x80\x94this one for [[Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]]. Harris and Ronstadt then released a duet album, \'\'[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]\'\', later the same year.  The two superstars toured together during the fall months in support of the disc. Both albums made the Top 10 of Billboard\'s Country Albums chart and did well on the pop side as well.

Also in 1999, Harris paid tribute to her former singing partner [[Gram Parsons]] by co-executive producing \'\'[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]\'\', an album that gathered together more than a dozen artists. Harris performed duets with [[Beck]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[the Pretenders]] on this album\'s tracks.

In 2000, Harris released her solo follow-up to \'\'Wrecking Ball\'\', \'\'[[Red Dirt Girl]]\'\', produced by Lanois prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 [[Malcolm Burn]]. For the first time since \'\'[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]\'\', the album contained a number of Harris\'s own compositions. Like \'\'Wrecking Ball\'\', the album\'s sound leaned more toward alternative rock than country. Nevertheless it reached No.&nbsp;5 on Billboard\'s Country Albums chart as well as a healthy No.&nbsp;54 on the pop side.  It also won Harris another of her 12 Grammy awards, in the category of [[Best Contemporary Folk Album]].

Harris also accompanied on [[alternative country]] singer [[Ryan Adams]]\' solo debut \'\'[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]\'\' and on [[Tracy Chapman]]\'s fifth album \'\'[[Telling Stories]]\'\'.

Also in 2000, Harris joined an all-star group of traditional [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] artists for the [[T-Bone Burnett]]-produced [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the [[Coen Brothers]] film, \'\'[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]\'\'  The soundtrack won multiple [[Country Music Association|CMA]], [[Academy of Country Music|ACM]] and Grammy awards. A documentary/[[concert film]], \'\'[[Down from the Mountain]]\'\', featured the artists performing music from the film and other songs at the [[Ryman Auditorium]]. Harris and many of the same artists took their show on the road for the Down from the Mountain Tour in 2002. In 2003, Harris supplied the finishing touches in harmonizing with the [[Dixie Chicks]] on a song they were recording in the studio, "Godspeed".

===Recent work===
Harris released \'\'[[Stumble into Grace]]\'\', her follow-up to \'\'[[Red Dirt Girl]]\'\', in 2003. Like its predecessor, it contained mostly self-penned material. In 2004, Harris led the [[Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue]] tour with [[Gillian Welch]], [[David Rawlings]], [[Buddy Miller]] and [[Patty Griffin]]. They performed singly and together and swapped instruments.

On September 9, 2005, Harris participated in "[[Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast]]", a series of concerts [[simulcast]] by most American television stations to raise money for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]]. She performed with [[Beth Neilsen Chapman]] and the Dixie Chicks, harmonizing on Patty Griffin\'s song, "Mary". She also lent her voice to the soundtrack of the critically acclaimed 2005 film, \'\'[[Brokeback Mountain]]\'\', on the song "A Love That Will Never Grow Old", which was controversially omitted from Oscar consideration due to an insubstantial amount of time of the song played during the film.

In 2005, Harris worked with [[Conor Oberst]] on [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]]\' release, \'\'[[I\'m Wide Awake, It\'s Morning]]\'\', performing backup vocals on three tracks.

Harris and Costello recorded a version of Costello\'s song, "The Scarlet Tide", from the soundtrack of the movie \'\'[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]\'\'. July also saw the release of \'\'[[The Very Best of Emmylou Harris: Heartaches & Highways]]\'\', a single-disc retrospective of Harris\'s career, on the [[Rhino Entertainment]] label. This same year, Harris appeared as a guest vocalist on [[Neil Young]]\'s widely acclaimed \'\'[[Prairie Wind (album)|Prairie Wind]]\'\'. She also appeared in the [[Jonathan Demme]] documentary-concert film \'\'[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]\'\', released in 2006.

The album was a commercial success, reaching No.&nbsp;8 in the UK and No.&nbsp;17 in the US. Selections recorded during the \'\'All the Roadrunning\'\' tour performance at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] were released as a CD/DVD package titled \'\'[[Real Live Roadrunning]]\'\' in November 2006.

A solo album, \'\'[[All I Intended to Be]]\'\', was released on June 10, 2008, to critical acclaim.  It reached Top Five of \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'\'s Country Albums chart and the Top 20 of the Pop Albums chart.

[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] host [[Tavis Smiley]] interviewed Harris in a program that aired on April 20, 2011.

From its inception, the group has been notable for the fact that all members share lead vocal and songwriting duties, in a manner that has been compared to [[The Band]].<ref name="songwritingmagazine1">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/features/interview-the-whybirds/14011 |title=Interview: The Whybirds |publisher=Songwriting Magazine |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref><ref name="Wilding, Phil 2010">Wilding, Phil.

The group met at school, where Haswell, Tuchscherer and Thatcher had originally played together in The View. The View disbanded in 2005 and the three joined with Banks to form The Whybirds a year later.<ref name="Freeman, Richie">{{cite web|author=Freeman, Richie |url=http://penseyeview.wordpress.com/2008/02/24/todays-feature-february-23-24-the-whybirds/ |title=Today\xe2\x80\x99s Feature \xe2\x80\x93 February 23-24: The Whybirds &#124; PensEyeView.com |publisher=Penseyeview.wordpress.com |date=2008-02-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> However, Taff Thatcher left The Whybirds in 2012 and Haswell moved from guitar to bass.<ref>{{cite web|author=Friday |url=http://www.prescriptionmusicpruk.com/press-releases/2013/9/6/the-whybirds-a-little-blood-is-out-on-november-4.html |title=The Whybirds\' \'A Little Blood\' is out on November 4 - Press releases - Music PR UK, Music Promotion and Band Promotion |publisher=Prescriptionmusicpruk.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

The band members cite their influences as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Neil Young]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Uncle Tupelo]], [[Ryan Adams]], [[Pearl Jam]] and [[My Morning Jacket]].<ref>http://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/features/interview-the-whybirds/14011</ref>

As for the band\'s name, Tuchscherer said in 2010: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reference to [[The Byrds]]. Their \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\' is the definitive [[country rock]] album, and they obviously spelt their name with a \xe2\x80\x98Y\xe2\x80\x99. So essentially it\xe2\x80\x99s a nod to them.<ref name="Wilding, Phil 2010"/>\xe2\x80\x9d However, in a 2008 interview the band said it was also a nod to [[The Yardbirds]].<ref name="Freeman, Richie"/>

As well as The Band, The Whybirds have been compared to Bruce Springsteen, [[The Who]],<ref name="rollingstone1">{{cite web|url=http://rollingstone.es/noticias/view/diez-buenas-bandas-de-rock-que-quiza-no-conozcas |title=Diez buenas bandas de rock que quiz\xc3\xa1 no conozcas en RollingStone |publisher=Rollingstone.es |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> [[Tom Petty]],<ref name="maverick-country1">{{cite web|url=http://www.maverick-country.com/cdreviewsmain.asp?pl=753 |title=Maverick - The UK\'s Leading Independent Country Music Magazine |publisher=Maverick-country.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> Pearl Jam, [[The Allman Brothers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americana-uk.com/interview-archive/interviews-2008/item/542-the-whybirds |title=The Whybirds |publisher=americanaUK |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> Neil Young (specifically with [[Crazy Horse]]),<ref name="movingtone1">{{cite web|url=http://www.movingtone.com/reviews/cd-review-rychard-carrington-reviews-cold-blue-sky-whybirds |title=CD Review: Rychard Carrington reviews Cold Blue Sky - The Whybirds |publisher=Moving Tone |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> [[Alex Chilton]] and [[Warren Zevon]]<ref name="rockshot1">{{cite web|author=Video: The Whybirds.

== Recording career ==

=== \'\'Tonight EP\'\' & \'\'The Whybirds\'\' (2007-2008) ===

The band\'s first release was the \'\'Tonight EP\'\' in August 2007, followed by their self-titled debut album in March 2008. Both were produced by Nick Mailing \xe2\x80\x93 who produced [[The Quireboys]]\' \'\'[[Well Oiled (The Quireboys album)|Well Oiled]]\'\' and \'\'[[Homewreckers & Heartbreakers]]\'\' records \xe2\x80\x93 at the same sessions in March/April 2007 at Lost Boys Studio in [[Cranfield]], Bedfordshire. \'\'The Whybirds\'\' album was launched at [[The Barfly]] in [[Camden Town]] in March 2008 but received little press attention on release.<ref>http://www.thewhybirds.com</ref>

=== \'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\', \'\'Live Recordings Vol. 1\'\' and national press attention (2009-2011) ===

The Whybirds\' sophomore album, \'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\', was recorded with the help of [[Elliot Mazer]],<ref name="songwritingmagazine1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uaudio.com/blog/elliot-mazer-ua-interview/ |title=Elliot Mazer: A Master Producer Combines the Best of Analog and Digital \xe2\x80\x94 Including the New UAD-2 SOLO/Laptop - Blog - Universal Audio |publisher=Uaudio.com |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> who produced [[Neil Young]]\'s \'\'[[Harvest]]\'\' and worked on recordings by The Byrds, The Band, [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] among others. Mazer worked on early sessions, but was unable to make it back from [[New York City]] when the album was being finished.<ref name="Wilding, Phil 2010"/>

\'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\' was ultimately co-produced by the band and Tom Peters \xe2\x80\x93 whose credits include [[Matt Cardle]], [[Cradle of Filth]], [[Porcupine Tree]] and [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]]<ref>{{cite web|author=info@blue-compass.com |url=http://www.musicnetworkpro.com/uk/view.php?uid=325233 |title=Tom Peters, Producer |location=52.24223;0.70733 |publisher=Musicnetworkpro.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> \xe2\x80\x93 at Monkey Puzzle House in [[Woolpit]], [[Suffolk]] in the summer of 2009.<ref>http://monkeypuzzlehouse.com/clients.php</ref>

The record was launched at a show at [[The Garage, London]] in [[Islington]] in November 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrUcfBfllaQ |title=The Whybirds 2009 @ Garage Rosalita |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-08 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> ahead of its official release in March 2010.

\'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\' was met with critical acclaim from the UK and European music press upon its release in 2010, with positive reviews from publications such as \'\'[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]\'\' (7/10),<ref>Fielder, Hugh.

In the \'\'Classic Rock\'\' Awards 2010, the magazine named "Jenny, Can We Take a Ride?" as their 33rd best song of the year, calling the track a "slice of blinding blue-collar country rock from the Bruce Springsteens of Bedford".<ref>"Critics\' Choice Songs of 2010", \'\'[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]\'\', January 2011.</ref>

In 2011, [[Rolling Stone]] called them one of the top 10 bands to watch.<ref name="rollingstone1"/>

The band\'s full length [[live album]], \'\'Live Recordings Vol.1\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 mixed by former Quireboy Chris Corney \xe2\x80\x93 was released in 2011 to good reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movingtone.com/reviews/cd-review-rychard-carrington-reviews-live-recordings-vol-1-whybirds |title=CD Review: Rychard Carrington reviews Live Recordings Vol. 1 - The Whybirds |publisher=Moving Tone |date=2011-10-29 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://djhimaging.com/?p=471 |title=The Whybirds \xe2\x80\x93 Live CD &#124; |publisher=Djhimaging.com |date=2011-01-02 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

The record features numerous [[segue]]s and extended periods of [[improvisation]] \xe2\x80\x93 in a style reminiscent of a [[jam band]] \xe2\x80\x93 which have long been part of the band\'s shows. Indeed, like many other jam bands, The Whybirds have an open taping policy, and many of their concerts have been uploaded to the [[Live Music Archive]] for free download.<ref>http://archive.org/details/TheWhybirds</ref>

=== New lineup (2012) ===

Thatcher left the group in February 2012, citing "how fickle the music industry is" and him becoming "extremely disillusioned with the whole concept of trying to sell music" as contributing factors. True to that sentiment, Thatcher releases music completely free of charge under the name The Quaint & The Curious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequaintandthecurious.net/interviews/ |title=Interviews &#124; The Quaint & the Curious |publisher=Thequaintandthecurious.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

Following the split, The Whybirds took some time to "relearn how to be a band" and during this period, the group nearly disbanded entirely. Singer/drummer Luke Tuchscherer was quoted by Songwriting Magazine as saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Taff left, the initial discussion was around getting another bassist. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get to the point of auditioning anyone, because we just thought they\xe2\x80\x99d have to be a brilliant bass player and a brilliant singer, plus Taff was a great songwriter. That\xe2\x80\x99s already pretty big shoes for anyone to fill. On top of that, the rest of us have been playing together for years and are best friends, so no-one would\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to come into the band. So there appeared to be no other option other than to quit, but then Ben said, \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I play bass?\xe2\x80\x99 That saved the band really.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref name="songwritingmagazine1"/>

\'\'A Little Blood\'\' was produced by Nick Mailing<ref name="songwritingmagazine1"/> at Lost Boys Studio, Cranfield and Alexander Sound Studio in [[Milton Keynes]] and mixed by Tom Peters. The record saw The Whybirds going in a "meaner, darker, grittier" direction due to both the change in lineup and the mood within the band.<ref name="indielondon1">{{cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Music-Review/the-whybirds-a-little-blood-review |title=The Whybirds - A Little Blood (Review) - Your London Reviews |publisher=IndieLondon |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

In a press release accompanying the album,<ref>{{cite web|author=Friday |url=http://www.prescriptionmusicpruk.com/press-releases/2013/9/6/the-whybirds-a-little-blood-is-out-on-november-4.html#.Us01iejcZ7k |title=The Whybirds\' \'A Little Blood\' is out on November 4 - Press releases - Music PR UK, Music Promotion and Band Promotion |publisher=Prescriptionmusicpruk.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref> Dave Banks was quoted as saying: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything good we thought would happen to us leading up to and after \'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\' just didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The new record is about three guys crashing into their thirties, and realising it isn\xe2\x80\x99t what they thought it would be. A lot of the characters in these songs don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have a lot going for them. But for some of them, there is still a little hope.\xe2\x80\x9d

Tuchscherer was quoted by Spiral Earth as saying: "The last one, \'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\', had a very optimistic feel to it. We as a band were being promised the earth, we were younger, less jaded\xe2\x80\xa6 This record, well, I think the things that happened to us between this one and the last \xe2\x80\x93 including losing a member \xe2\x80\x93 influenced the songs greatly. The record, to me, is about hitting your 30s, with the backdrop of maybe not having the best government, people struggling to get by, having dreams go unfilled\xe2\x80\xa6but still being alive. The song \xe2\x80\x9cA Little Blood\xe2\x80\x9d is talking about one thing, but for me, the album\xe2\x80\x99s title is summed up by the penultimate track, where it says: \'They ain\xe2\x80\x99t killed us yet, there\xe2\x80\x99s a little blood to bleed\'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiralearth.co.uk/news/kusharstory.asp?nid=8041 |title=Dave Kushar - Interviews and features from folk to blues |publisher=Spiralearth.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

In a positive review in the February 2014 issue of \'\'Classic Rock\'\', critic Philip Wilding said: "Critical acclaim can only carry a band so far. A case in point is the feverish plaudits that greeted The Whybirds\' 2010 album \'\'Cold Blue Sky\'\', with the band lauded as England\'s answer to the Allmans... This album is an exercise in realisation. Grittier, darker tones, downbeat lyrics. The writing\xe2\x80\x99s on the wall. The band\xe2\x80\x99s songwriting still shines through the fuzz, though \xe2\x80\x93 songs like \'Never Let You Go\' and \'More Than He Could Stand\' are brittle but beautiful. Their heads might be hung low, but their songs still resonate."<ref>Wilding, Philip, "Darker, meaner, stripped back", \'\'[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]\'\', February 2014</ref>

\'\'Classic Rock Society\'\' magazine wrote in its Jan/Feb 2014 issue that the record "...funnels Jayhawks Americana through the English [[power trio]] sound and gives us some hard, anthemic, big chorus, sing-along rock tracks. Driving rock that needs to be played loud. Remember the name, these guys are going to be huge."<ref>JRT, "Synopsis", \'\'Classic Rock Society\'\', p51, Issue 199, Jan/Feb 2014</ref>

The record placed at number seven in Americana UK\'s album chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americana-uk.com/ |title=The UK Home of Americana |publisher=americanaUK |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

Songwriting Magazine named "The Cure" as a runner up in its Best Rock Songs of 2013 list and the band as a whole as one of the most overlooked bands of the year, saying "we can\'t see why their records aren\'t flying off digital shelves".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritingmagazine.co.uk/features/best-of-2013/14610 |title=Best Of 2013 |publisher=Songwriting Magazine |date=2013-12-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}</ref>

In March 2014, Tuchscherer announced a [[Pledge Music]] campaign for his debut solo record. The album, \'\'You Get So Alone At Times That It Just Makes Sense\'\', is named after a book by [[Charles Bukowski]]. Produced by Tom Peters, the record features Banks and Haswell from the band, as well as other guests including Max Hart ([[We Are Scientists]], [[Katy Perry]]), Nick Mailing (The Quireboys), Chris Corney (The Quireboys) and Simon Rinaldo (Pearl Handled Revolver), with string arrangements by Bedford composer Johnny Parry.<ref>http://www.beat-surrender.com/2014/03/06/luke-tuchscherer-you-get-so-alone-at-times-that-it-just-makes-sense-pledge-campaign/</ref><ref>http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/yougetsoalone</ref> The Pledge campaign hit 120% halfway through the 60-day period and it was later announced that the album\'s official release would be 6 October 2014.

When asked \xe2\x80\x93 in an interview with Spanish magazine \'\'Ruta 66\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 why he needed to make a solo album, Tuchscherer said: "I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I \'\'needed\'\' to, but basically, Tom Peters asked me at the end of 2010 whether I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do some recording with him. I asked the others if they had a problem, no one said they did, so in January 2011 I went into the studio with Tom." He said that the album was recorded in a week or so, with the days spread out over two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ruta66.es/2014/07/encuentros/luke-tuchscherer-suenos-que-se-hacen-realidad/ |title=Luke Tuchscherer, sue\xc3\xb1os que se hacen realidad

==Politics==
[[Image:Charlie Daniels at NavSta Great Lakes.jpg|thumb|upright|Charlie Daniels performing at U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, September 11, 2003]]
Daniels\' public politics evolved over the course of his career in a general [[American conservatism|rightward]] progression. His earliest hit, "Uneasy Rider," portrayed him as a hippie in the counterculture movement, caught in an argument with right-wing rednecks. "The South\'s Gonna Do It" had a mild message of Southern cultural identity within the Southern rock movement. Daniels was an early supporter of [[Jimmy Carter]]\'s [[President of the United States|presidential]] bid and performed at his January 1977 inauguration.

"[[In America (Charlie Daniels song)|In America]]" was a reaction to the 1979\xe2\x80\x931981 [[Iran Hostage Crisis]]; it described a patriotic, united America where "we\'ll all stick together and you can take that to the bank/That\'s the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks." The song experienced a revival following the [[September 11 attacks]], when it was floated around the internet as "Fuck [[Osama Bin Laden|Bin Laden]]". 

In 1989, Daniels\' country hit "Simple Man" was interpreted by some as advocating [[vigilantism]]. Lyrics such as "Just take them rascals [rapists, killers, child abusers] out in the swamp/Put \'em on their knees and tie \'em to a stump/Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest", garnered Daniels considerable media attention and talk show visits.

In 2003, Daniels published an \'\'Open Letter to the Hollywood Bunch\'\' in defense of President [[George W. Bush]]\'s [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] policy. His 2003 book \'\'Ain\'t No Rag: Freedom, Family, and the Flag\'\' contains this letter as well as many other personal statements. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Daniels said that having never served in the military himself, he did not have the right to criticize [[John Kerry]]\'s service record, but that Kerry should allow the release of his official military record to establish the truth or falsehood of allegations from the [[Swift Boat Veterans for Truth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050409190807/http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox/print/399.html|archivedate=2005-04-09 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|publisher=Web.archive.org|date=April 9, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> His band\'s official website contains a "soapbox" page,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox.htm|title=The Charlie Daniels Band \xe2\x80\x93 Soapbox|publisher=Charliedaniels.com|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> where Daniels has made statements such as the following: "In the future Darwinism will be looked upon as we now look upon the flat earth theory", and "I am more afraid of you and your ilk than I am of the terrorists", regarding [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Harry Reid]]. On March 27, 2009, Daniels criticized the [[Obama Administration]] for "changing the name of the War on Terror to the "[[War on Terror|Overseas Contingency Operation]]" and referring to terrorism as "man-caused disasters"".<ref>{{cite web|title=It\'s Finally Happened| publisher=The Charlie Daniels Band|date=March 27, 2009|url=http://www.charliedaniels.com/soapbox-2009/soapbox-2009-0327.htm|accessdate=April 2, 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Daniels was born October 28, 1936, in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], and raised on a musical diet that included Pentecostal gospel, local bluegrass bands and the rhythm & blues and country music from Nashville\'s 50,000-watt radio stations [[WLAC]] and [[WSM (AM)]]. He grew up in the small town of [[Gulf, North Carolina|Gulf, Chatham County, North Carolina]]. He graduated from high school in 1955. Already skilled on guitar, fiddle, banjo, and mandolin, he formed a rock \'n\' roll band and hit the road.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/daniels_charlie/bio.jhtml|work=Charlie Daniels|publisher=CMT.com|accessdate=March 5, 2011}}</ref>

Daniels enjoys hunting, fishing, skydiving, and other outdoor activities. He is a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). He married his wife, Hazel, in 1963. Together, they have one son, Charlie Daniels, Jr.<ref>[http://www.charliedaniels.com/theband/cdb-bios.htm The Charlie Daniels Band-Band Bios], charliedaniels.com; accessed April 4, 2015.</ref>

Daniels suffered a major arm injury on January 30, 1980 while digging fence post holes on his farm near Mount Juliet, where he lives. He suffered three complete breaks in his right arm, and two broken fingers when his shirtsleeve caught on a spinning auger. The injury required surgery, and sidelined him for four months.<ref name="Charlie injury 1">{{cite web|last1=Ocala Star-Banner|date=January 30, 1980|title=Country-Rock Singer Charlie Daniels Hurt In Farm Accident|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pp5PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sAUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2784%2C5419318|website=Google News|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Charlie injury 2">{{cite web|title=Charlie Daniels on his medical recovery: \'Doctors treat and God heals\'|url=http://www.today.com/health/charlie-daniels-his-medical-recovery-doctors-treat-god-heals-2D79468130|website=Today Health|date=April 1, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}</ref>

During a doctor visit on March 25, 2013, Daniels was diagnosed with a mild case of [[pneumonia]] and admitted to a [[Nashville]] hospital for a series of routine tests. The tests revealed that a [[pacemaker]] was needed to regulate his heart rate. One was put in on March 28 and Daniels was expected to be out of the hospital the next day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Daniels gets a pacemaker|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/03/28/charlie-daniels-has-successful-pacemaker-surgery/2028961|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=March 30, 2013|date=March 28, 2013}}</ref>

He is a multi-instrumentalist, but is known for his [[slide guitar]] work, his interest in [[Traditional music|roots music]] from the United States, and, more recently, his collaborations with traditional musicians from many countries.

His solo work has been eclectic, encompassing many genres including [[Americana]], [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], [[soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], rock, and much more. He has collaborated with many musicians, notably including [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Ali Farka Tour\xc3\xa9]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Neil Young]], [[Randy Newman]], [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[The Chieftains]], and [[The Doobie Brothers]], Carla Olson & the Textones (both on record and in film).

==Career==

===1960s===
Cooder first attracted attention playing with [[Captain Beefheart]] and his Magic Band, notably on the 1967 album \'\'[[Safe As Milk]]\'\', after previously having worked with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Ed Cassidy]] in the [[Rising Sons]]. It is said that he quit the Magic Band after Beefheart fell offstage at a music festival, later claiming to have seen a girl in the audience transform into a [[goldfish]]. He also played with [[Randy Newman]] at this time, including on \'\'[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deming | first=Mark | url={{Allmusic|class=album |id=r14019 |pure_url=yes}} | title=12 Songs \xe2\x80\x93 Randy Newman | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> [[Van Dyke Parks]] worked with Newman and Cooder during the 1960s. Parks arranged Cooder\'s "One Meatball" according to Parks\' 1984 interview by Bob Claster.

Cooder was a [[session musician]] on various recording sessions with the [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums \'\'[[Let It Bleed]]\'\' ([[Yank Rachell|Yank Rachell-style]]  mandolin on "[[Love in Vain]]"), and \'\'[[Sticky Fingers]]\'\', on which he contributed the slide guitar on "[[Sister Morphine]]". During this period, Cooder joined with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], and longtime Rolling Stones [[sideman]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] to record \'\'[[Jamming with Edward!]]\'\'. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack \'\'[[Performance (film)|Performance]]\'\', which contained Jagger\'s first solo single, "[[Memo from Turner]]". The 1975 [[compilation album]] \'\'[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]\'\' features an uncredited Cooder contribution on Bill Wyman\'s "Downtown Suzie".

Ry Cooder also collaborated with [[Lowell George]] of Little Feat, playing slide guitar on the original version of "Willin\'".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/FeatWilling.htm | title=Willin\' | publisher=University of Vienna | accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref>

===1970s===
Throughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the [[Reprise Records]] label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise\'s artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical [[genres]] and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, \'\'[[Into the Purple Valley]]\'\', he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, [[calypso music|calypso]], and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad "Billy the Kid"). The album opened with the song "How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)" by [[Agnes "Sis" Cunningham]] about the [[Okie]]s who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s \xe2\x80\x93 to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his "Bad Rice" album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of \'\'[[Jazz (Ry Cooder album)|Jazz]]\'\', which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; \'\'Into the Purple Valley\'\', \'\'[[Boomer\'s Story]]\'\', and \'\'[[Paradise and Lunch]]\'\' as [[folk music|folk]] and blues; \'\'[[Chicken Skin Music]]\'\' and \'\'Showtime\'\' as a mix of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] and [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]]; \'\'[[Bop Till You Drop]]\'\' as 1950s\' [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]; and \'\'[[Borderline (Ry Cooder album)|Borderline]]\'\' and \'\'Get Rhythm\'\' as rock-based. His 1979 album \'\'Bop Till You Drop\'\' was the first [[popular music]] album to be [[digital recording|recorded digitally]]. It yielded his biggest [[chart-topper|hit]], an R&B [[cover version]] of [[Elvis Presley]]\'s 1960s recording "[[Little Sister (Pomus/Shuman song)|Little Sister]]". 

Cooder is credited on [[Van Morrison]]\'s 1979 album, \'\'[[Into the Music]]\'\', for slide guitar on the song "[[Full Force Gale]]". He also played guitar on [[Judy Collins]]\' 1970 concert tour, and is featured on \'\'[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]\'\', the 1971 live album recorded during that tour.  He also learned from and performed with [[Gabby Pahinui]] and [[Leland Isaacs, Sr.|"Atta" Isaacs]] in Hawaii during the early \'70s [[Hawaiian Renaissance]].

===1980s===
Cooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many [[film soundtrack]]s including [[Wim Wenders]] film \'\'[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]\'\' (1984). Cooder based this soundtrack and title song "Paris, Texas" on [[Blind Willie Johnson]]\'s "[[Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)]]", which he described as "The most soulful, transcendent piece in all American music."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html;COXnetJSessionID=1ITtL0zcaTYPiiTPLjP1a2lrfOo25kwasby2KrVda2n1BrlyX13b!-615020192?urac=n&urvf=10701094852420.8419290445454791" |title= The Soul of Blind Willie Johnson:Retracing the life of the Texas music icon |author=Corcoran, Michael|publisher=austin360.com|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> Musician [[Dave Grohl]] has declared Cooder\'s score for \'\'Paris, Texas\'\' one of his favorite albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA57|page=57|last=Greenwald|first=Andy|title=The Chosen Foo|journal=Spin|date=August 2005}}</ref>

"Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)" was also the basis for Cooder\'s song "Powis Square" for the movie \'\'[[Performance (film)|Performance]]\'\'. His other film work includes [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]\'s \'\'[[The Long Riders]]\'\' (1980), \'\'[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]\'\' (1981), \'\'[[Streets of Fire]]\'\' (1984), \'\'[[Brewster\'s Millions (1985 film)|Brewster\'s Millions]]\'\' (1985), \'\'[[Johnny Handsome]]\'\',<ref>\'\'Johnny Handsome:Original Motion PictureSoundtrack\'\', Warner Bros.

Cooder along with [[Arlen Roth]] dubbed all slide guitar parts in the 1986 film \'\'[[Crossroads (1986 film)|Crossroads]]\'\', a take on blues legend [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]. In 1988, Cooder produced the album by his longtime backing vocalists [[Bobby King]] and [[Terry Evans (musician)|Terry Evans]] on Rounder Records titled \'\'Live and Let Live\'\'. He contributed his slide guitar work to every track. He also plays extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release \'\'Rhythm, Blues, Soul & Grooves\'\'.  Cooder\'s music also appeared on two episodes of the television program "Tales From the Crypt" \xe2\x80\x93 "The Man Who Was Death" and "The Thing From the Grave."<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-music-from-tales-from-the-crypt-w93724 Review  of \'\'Tales From the Crypt\'\'] by Steven McDonald, \'\'AllMusic.com</ref>

In 1984, Ry played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson & the Textones \'\'Midnight Mission\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 "Carla\'s Number One is to Survive" and the previously unreleased Bob Dylan song "Clean Cut Kid". Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film \'\'Blue City\'\' and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them in the studio and produced "You Can Run" which he also played on.)

In 1985, Ry was a guest artist on the song "Rough Edges" from [[Kim Carnes]]\' album [[Barking at Airplanes]]. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder.

He played electric slide guitar on [[The Beach Boys]]\' 1988 hit [[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]].

Also in 1988. he produced and featured in the [[Les Blank]] directed concert documentary film \'\'Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let\'s Have a Ball\'\' where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170532/|title=Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let\'s Have a Ball (1988)|author=RondoHatton|date=August 31, 1991|work=IMDb|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The following year, he played a janitor in the [[Jim Henson]] series \'\'[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]\'\', in the episode "Music Is More Than Technique".<ref>[[wikiasite:muppet:Episode 104: Music Is More Than Technique|Episode 104: Music Is More Than Technique]] on Muppet Wiki</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 |title=The Jim Henson Company YouTube Channel |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref>

===1990s===
In the early 1990s Cooder collaborated on two [[world music]] "crossover" albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For \'\'[[A Meeting by the River]]\'\' (1993), which also featured his son [[Joachim Cooder]] on percussion, he teamed with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical musician [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt|V.M. Bhatt]], a virtuoso of the [[Mohan Veena]] (a modified 20-string [[archtop guitar]] of Bhatt\'s own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player. In 1995 he teamed with African multi-instrumentalist [[Ali Farka Toure]] on the album \'\'[[Talking Timbuktu]]\'\', which he also produced; the album also featured longtime Cooder collaborator [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, veteran blues guitarist [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]], jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] and African percussionists and musicians including [[Hamma Sankare]] and [[Oumar Toure]]. Both albums won the [[Grammy Award]] for \'Best World Music Album\' in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singers]] for the score to the 1993 film \'\'[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]\'\'.

In 1995 he performed in \'\'[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]\'\', a musical performance of the popular story at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York to benefit the [[Children\'s Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.

In the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional [[Cuba]]n music, due to his collaboration as producer of the \'\'[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]\'\' (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. [[Wim Wenders]], who had previously directed 1984\'s \'\'[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]\'\', directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, \'\'[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]\'\' (1999), which was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2000.<ref name="NY Times">{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |title=NY Times: Buena Vista Social Club |accessdate=November 22, 2008|work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref> The enterprise cost him a $25,000 dollar fine for violating the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/04/jazz.popandrock|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Interview \xe2\x80\x93 From the Dust|date=3 March 2007|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/06/entertainment/ca-21581|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=With Help From Up High, Cooder\'s Back in Cuba|date=February 6, 2001|accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>

===2000s===
Cooder\'s 2005 album \'\'[[Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine (album)|Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine]]\'\' was touted by his [[record label]] as being "a post-World War II-era American narrative of \'cool cats\', radios, UFO sightings, J. Edgar Hoover, red scares, and baseball".<ref name=Nonesuch>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/chavez-ravine|title= Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine: About this album|publisher= Nonesuch Records|accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> The record is a tribute to the long-gone Los Angeles Latino enclave known as [[Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine]]. Using real and imagined historical characters, Cooder and friends created an album that recollects various aspects of the poor but vibrant hillside [[Chicano]] community which no longer exists. Cooder says, "Here is some music for a place you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, up a road you don\xe2\x80\x99t go. Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends."<ref name=Nonesuch/> Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including [[conjunto]], R&B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Ch\xc3\xa1vez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]] legends like Chicano music patriarch [[Lalo Guerrero]], [[Pachuco]] boogie king [[Don Tosti]], [[Thee Midniters]] front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and [[El Chicano]].

Cooder\'s next record was released in 2007. Entitled \'\'[[My Name Is Buddy]]\'\', it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad. The entire recording is a parable of the working class progressivism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7719791|title=Cooder\'s \'Buddy\' Revives Tales of a Bygone America|publisher= NPR Music|date= March 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}</ref> of the first half of the American twentieth century, and even has a song featuring executed unionist [[Joe Hill]]. \'\'My Name Is Buddy\'\' was accompanied by a booklet featuring a story and illustration (by Vincent Valdez) for each track, providing additional context to Buddy\'s adventures.

Cooder produced and performed on an album for [[Mavis Staples]] entitled \'\'[[We\'ll Never Turn Back]]\'\', which was released on April 24, 2007. The [[concept album]] focused on [[Gospel music|Gospel]] songs of the [[civil rights movement]] and also included two new original songs by Cooder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56405/mavis-staples-gets-personal-on-anti-debut|title=Mavis Staples Gets Personal On Anti-Debut|author=Cohen, Jonathan and Martens, Todd|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 19, 2006|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>

Ry Cooder\'s album \'\'[[I, Flathead]]\'\' was released on June 24, 2008. It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the [[drag racing]] culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.

In late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand and Australia with [[Nick Lowe]], performing some of Lowe\'s songs and a selection of Cooder\'s own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry\'s son) provided percussion, and Juliette Commagere and Alex Lilly contributed backing vocals.

The song "Diaraby", which Cooder recorded with [[Ali Farka Tour\xc3\xa9]], is used as the theme to \'\'[[The World (radio program)|The World]]\'s\'\' Geo Quiz. \'\'The World\'\' is a radio show distributed by [[Public Radio International]].

In 2009, Cooder performed in \'\'[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]\'\', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]\'s \'\'[[A People\'s History of the United States]]\'\'. Cooder performed with [[Bob Dylan]] and Van Dyke Parks on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. They played "[[Do Re Mi (Woody Guthrie song)|Do Re Mi]]" and reportedly a couple of other [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie]] songs that were excluded from the final edit. He also traveled with the band [[Los Tigres del Norte]] and recorded the 2010 album \'\'[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]\'\' with the Chieftains, [[Lila Downs]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], [[Los Cenzontles]], and Los Tigres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/24/100524fa_fact_wilkinson |title=Onward and Upward with the Arts, "Immigration Blues"|author= Wilkinson, Alec |work=The New Yorker|date=May 24, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069640/the-chieftains-featuring-ry-cooder-san-patricio|title=The Chieftains featuring Ry Cooder,"San Patricio"|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|\'\'Billboard\'\']]|author= Wood, Mikael|date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

In 2011, he published a collection of short stories called \'\'[[Los Angeles Stories]]\'\', written about people living in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s.  The book\'s characters are mostly talented or skilled, clever or hardworking people living in humble circumstances.  With story titles such as "La vida es un sue\xc3\xb1o" and "Kill me, por favor", the collection\'s stories often have a Hispanic theme, and the book deals partially with Latinos living in Los Angeles during this time.

An \'\'[[American Songwriter]]\'\' article in 2012 suggested that Cooder\'s recent string of solo albums have often taken on an allegorical, sociopolitical bent. Music journalist Evan Schlansky said that "Cooder\xe2\x80\x99s latest effort, \'\'[[Election Special]]\'\' (released August 21, 2012, on Nonesuch/Perro Verde) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mince words.

He also composed a full album (\'\'Election Special\'\') as his own part of support to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its president [[Barack Obama]] in the 2012 American Presidential Election.

On September 10, 2013, Ry Cooder released \'\'[[Live in San Francisco (Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos album)|Live in San Francisco]]\'\', featuring the Corridos Famosos band, including [[Joachim Cooder]] on drums; [[Robert Francis (musician)|Robert Francis]] on bass; vocalists Terry Evans, Arnold McCuller, and [[Juliette Commagere]]; [[Flaco Jim\xc3\xa9nez]] on accordion; and the Mexican brass band La Banda Juvenil. The album was recorded during a two-night run at [[Great American Music Hall]] in [[San Francisco]], August 31 and September 1, 2011. It is Cooder\'s first official live recording since \'\'Show Time\'\' in 1977 (which had also been recorded at Great American Music Hall).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/nonesuch-perro-verde-records-release-ry-cooder-corridos-famosos-live-in-san-francisco-september-10-2013-07-23|title=Nonesuch / Perro Verde Records Release Ry Cooder and Corridos Famosos\xe2\x80\x99 "Live in San Francisco" September 10|publisher=[[Nonesuch Records]]|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>

\'\'\'Creedence Clearwater Revival\'\'\' was an American [[rock music|rock]] band active in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter [[John Fogerty]], rhythm guitarist [[Tom Fogerty]], bassist [[Stu Cook]] and drummer [[Doug Clifford]].

==History==
===The Blue Velvets/The Golliwogs: 1959\xe2\x80\x931967===
John Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook (all born in 1945) met at Portola Junior High School in [[El Cerrito, California]]. They began playing instrumentals and "juke box standards" under the name [[The Blue Velvets]],<ref name=rs30>{{Cite news|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|author-link=Ben Fong-Torres|title=Creedence C\'water At the Hop|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=9|date=April 5, 1969|issue=30}}</ref> also backing singer Tom Fogerty at live gigs and in the recording studio. Tom joined the band, and in 1964 they signed with [[Fantasy Records]], an independent jazz label in San Francisco that had released \'\'[[Cast Your Fate to the Wind]]\'\', a national hit for jazz pianist [[Vince Guaraldi|Vince Guaraldi.]] The record\'s success was the subject of a [[National Educational Television]] special, which prompted budding songwriter John Fogerty to contact the label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/article/fantasy-studios-alive-and-well-in-berkeley.html|title=Fantasy Studios: Alive and Well in Berkeley|publisher=Crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com|date=August 6, 2008|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

Band roles changed during this period. Stu Cook switched from piano to bass guitar and Tom Fogerty from lead vocals to rhythm guitar; John became the band\'s lead vocalist and primary songwriter. In Tom Fogerty\'s words: "I could sing, but John had a sound!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/05/14/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival/|last=Sullivan|first=James|title=John Fogerty Sued for Plagiarizing ...

===Early success: 1967\xe2\x80\x931968===
In 1966, the group suffered a setback when John Fogerty and Doug Clifford were drafted into military service. Fogerty enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] and Clifford in the [[United States Coast Guard Reserve]].

In 1967, [[Saul Zaentz]] bought Fantasy Records and offered the band a chance to record a full-length album on the condition that they change their name. Having never liked "the Golliwogs," in part because of the racial charge of the name, the four readily agreed. Zaentz and the band agreed to come up with ten suggestions each, but he enthusiastically agreed to their first: Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), which they took in January, 1968.<ref name=pc54>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19837/m1/ |title=Show 54 - Hail, Hail, Rock \'n\' Roll: Getting back to rock\'s funky, essential essence.

*a television commercial for [[Olympia Brewing Company|Olympia beer]] ("clear water"); and
*the four members\' renewed commitment to their band.

Rejected contenders for the band\'s name included Muddy Rabbit, Gossamer Wump, and Creedence Nuball and the Ruby, but the last was the start that led to their finalized name.<ref name="isbn"/>

By 1968, Fogerty and Clifford had been discharged from military service, and all four members had quit their jobs to begin an intense schedule of rehearsing and playing full-time at clubs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[AM radio]] programmers around the U.S.A. took note when the  song "[[Susie Q (song)|Susie Q]]" from their [[Creedence Clearwater Revival (album)|self-titled debut album]] received substantial airplay in the San Francisco Bay Area and on Chicago\'s [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} A remake of a 1956 song by [[rockabilly]] singer [[Dale Hawkins]],<ref name=pc54/> "Susie Q" was the band\'s second single\xe2\x80\x94its first to reach the [[Top 40]] (No. 11). It would be CCR\'s only Top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty. Two other singles from the debut were released: a cover of [[Screamin\' Jay Hawkins]]\'s "[[I Put a Spell on You]]" (No.&nbsp;58) and "Porterville" (released on the Scorpio label with writing credited to "T. Spicebush Swallowtail"), written during Fogerty\'s time in the Army Reserve.

===Peak success: 1969\xe2\x80\x931970===
After their breakthrough, CCR began touring and started work on their second album, \'\'[[Bayou Country]]\'\' (1969), at [[RCA]] Studios in [[Los Angeles]]. A No.&nbsp;7 platinum hit, the record was their first in a string of hit albums and singles that continued uninterrupted for three years. The single "[[Proud Mary]]", backed with "Born on the Bayou", reached No.&nbsp;2 on the national \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\' chart. The former would eventually become the group\'s most-covered song, with some 100 cover versions by other artists to date, including a hit version in 1971 by [[Ike & Tina Turner]]. John Fogerty cites this song as being the result of high spirits on gaining his discharge from the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]].<ref name=pc54/> The album also featured a remake of the rock & roll classic "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]"<ref name=pc54/> and the band\'s nine-minute live-show closer, "Keep On Chooglin\'".

Weeks later, in March 1969, "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]" backed with "[[Lodi (Creedence Clearwater Revival song)|Lodi]]" was released and peaked at No.&nbsp;2. In the [[United Kingdom]], "Bad Moon Rising" spent three weeks at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] during September and October 1969, becoming the band\'s only number one single in the UK.{{cn|date=September 2014}} The band\'s third album, \'\'[[Green River (album)|Green River]],\'\' followed in August 1969 and went gold along with the single "Green River", which again reached No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard charts. The B-side of "Green River", "Commotion", peaked at No.&nbsp;30 and the band\'s emphasis on remakes of their old favorites continued with "[[Night Time Is the Right Time]]".

CCR continued to tour incessantly with performances at the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]] and [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]. Their set was not included in the [[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock film]] or soundtrack because John Fogerty felt the band\'s performance was subpar. (Several tracks from the event were eventually included in the 1994 commemorative box set.) Stu Cook, however, held an opposing view, saying "The performances are classic CCR and I\'m still amazed by the number of people who don\'t even know we were one of the headliners at Woodstock \'69."<ref name="Woodstock quote">{{cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=I%27m+still+amazed+by+the+number+of+people+who+don%27t+even+know+we+were+one+of+the+headliners+at+Woodstock+%2769&source=bl&ots=PsJZ2hUzvq&sig=CYMEhFAyuRL-RRYssdGQYNNgozE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNHvU6_tGsKWyASUxYKYBQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival Page 65|author=Hank Bordowitz|publisher= Chicago Review Press, Incorporated|location=Chicago, Illinois|year=2007|page=65|isbn=978-1-55652-661-9|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref> John Fogerty later complained the previous band, the [[Grateful Dead]], put the audience to sleep, stoned and asleep; as John scanned the audience he saw a "Dante scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud."<ref name="isbn">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zDDKxvnPy7cC&pg=PA64 |title=Bad Moon Rising: The Unauthorized History of Creedence Clearwater Revival |author=Hank Bordowitz |publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated |location=Chicago, Illinois |year=2007 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-55652-661-9 |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>

An unapologetic throwback to the golden era of rock and roll, they broke ranks with their peers on the progressive, psychedelic San Francisco scene. Their approach was basic and uncompromising, holding true to the band members\' working-class origins. The term \'roots rock\' had not yet been invented when Creedence came along, but in a real way they defined it, drawing inspiration from the likes of Little Richard, Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and the artisans of soul at Motown and Stax. In so doing, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the standard bearers and foremost celebrants of homegrown American music."

After Woodstock, CCR was busy honing material for a fourth album, \'\'[[Willy and the Poor Boys]]\'\', released in November 1969. "[[Down on the Corner]]" and "[[Fortunate Son (song)|Fortunate Son]]" climbed to No.&nbsp;3 and No.&nbsp;14, respectively, by year\'s end. The album was CCR in its standard form, featuring Fogerty originals and two reworked [[Lead Belly]] covers, "[[Cotton Fields]]" and "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]". Both of the latter songs had also been performed by actor [[Harry Dean Stanton]] in the movie \'\'[[Cool Hand Luke]]\'\', suggesting a subtle non-conformist theme to an apparently tradition-oriented album.

The year 1969 had been a remarkable chart year for the band: three Top Ten albums, four hit singles (charting at No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;2, and No.&nbsp;3) with three additional charting [[B-side]]s. On November 16, 1969, they performed "Fortunate Son" and "Down on the Corner" on \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/the-ed-sullivan-show/creedence-clearwater-revival---jerry-lee-lewis/episode/106884/summary.html|title=The Ed Sullivan Show: Creedence Clearwater Revival / Jerry Lee Lewis|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}</ref>

CCR released another two-sided hit, "[[Travelin\' Band]]"/"[[Who\'ll Stop the Rain (song)|Who\'ll Stop the Rain]]" in January 1970. Except for [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]], Creedence had more success with two sided hit singles than any band up to that point in time.  John Fogerty has said that the flip side was inspired by the band\'s experience at Woodstock.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The speedy "Travelin\' Band", with a strong Little Richard sound, however, bore enough similarities to "Good Golly, Miss Molly" to warrant a lawsuit by the song\'s publisher;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} it was eventually settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdayinrock.com/index.php/general/1971-john-fogerty-is-sued-by-the-owners-of-specialty-records-their-suit-accuses/ |title=Rock History - 1971 \xe2\x80\x93 John Fogerty is sued by the owners of Specialty Records. |publisher=Thisdayinrock.com |date=October 14, 1971 |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref> The song ultimately topped out at No.&nbsp;2. The band also recorded its January 31, 1970, live performance at the [[Oakland Coliseum Arena]], which would later be marketed as a live album and television special. In February, CCR was featured on the cover of \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\', although only John Fogerty was interviewed in the accompanying article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/creedenceclearwaterrevival/photos/collection/photo/1|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Photo Gallery : Rolling Stone|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=February 21, 1970|accessdate=May 8, 2009}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

In April 1970, CCR was set to begin its first European tour. To support the upcoming live dates, Fogerty wrote "[[Up Around the Bend]]" and "[[Run Through the Jungle]]"; the single reached No.&nbsp;4 that spring. The band returned to [[Wally Heider]]\'s San Francisco [[Wally Heider Studios|studio]] in June to record \'\'[[Cosmo\'s Factory]]\'\'. The title was an in-joke about their various rehearsal facilities and factory work ethic over the years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} (Drummer Doug Clifford\'s longtime nickname is "Cosmo", due to his keen interest in nature and all things cosmic.){{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The album contained the earlier Top 10 hits "Travelin\' Band" and "Up Around the Bend" plus highly popular album tracks such as the opener "Ramble Tamble".

\'\'Cosmo\'s Factory\'\' was released in July 1970, along with the band\'s fifth and final No.&nbsp;2 national hit, "[[Lookin\' Out My Back Door]]"/"[[Long As I Can See the Light]]". Although they topped some international charts and local radio countdowns, CCR never had a No.&nbsp;1 [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] hit. Their five No.&nbsp;2 singles [[Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-two singles|were exceeded]] only by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] with six each and tied with [[The Carpenters]]. CCR also has the odd distinction of having the most No.&nbsp;2 singles on the \'\'Billboard\'\' charts without ever having had a No.&nbsp;1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/specials/hot100/charts/most-no2s-wo1s.shtml|title=Most No.&nbsp;2 Hits Without Reaching No.&nbsp;1 By Artist|work=[[Billboard Magazine]]|format=PHP}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Curiously, on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]], the band had three No.&nbsp;1, four No.&nbsp;3, two No.&nbsp;4, but no No.&nbsp;2 singles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/il/wlsyear.htm|title=WLS Year Index|publisher=Oldiesloon|date=1969, 1970, 1971|accessdate=December 26, 2011}}</ref>

Other cuts on the "Cosmo\'s Factory" album included an eleven-minute jam of the 1968 [[Marvin Gaye]] "[[I Heard It Through The Grapevine]]" (a minor hit when an edited version was released as a single in 1976), and a nearly note-for-note homage to [[Roy Orbison]]\'s "Ooby Dooby". The album was CCR\'s best seller and went to No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;11 on \'\'Billboard\'s\'\' Soul Albums chart.

===Decline and breakup: 1970\xe2\x80\x931972===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revival.jpg|thumb|CCR in 1972, after Tom Fogerty\'s departure; John Fogerty, Stu Cook, Doug Clifford]]
The \'\'Cosmo\'s Factory\'\' sessions had seen the stirrings of tensions within the foursome as the incessant touring and heavy recording schedules took their toll.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} John Fogerty had taken complete control of the group in matters of both business and artistic output, to the chagrin of Tom Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford. Fogerty resisted, feeling that a "democratic" process would threaten their success.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Other issues included Fogerty\'s decision at a 1970 Nebraska gig that the band would no longer give encores at its live shows.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

\'\'[[Pendulum (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|Pendulum]]\'\', released in December 1970, was another top seller, spawning a Top 10 hit with "[[Have You Ever Seen the Rain?]]". John Fogerty included Hammond B3 Organ on many of the \'\'Pendulum\'\' tracks, notably "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?", in recognition of the deep respect and influence of [[Booker T and The MG\'s]], with whom the members of the band had jammed. The single\'s flip side, "Hey Tonight", was also a hit.

Tom Fogerty decided he had had enough of his younger brother and resigned from CCR in late 1970 during the recording of \'\'Pendulum\'\'; his departure was made public the following February. At first, the remaining members considered replacing Tom but ultimately continued as a trio. Tom Fogerty later stated on an Australian television broadcast that no new member could endure being in CCR.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In spring 1971, John Fogerty did an about-face and informed Cook and Clifford that CCR would continue only by adopting a "democratic" approach: each member would now write and perform his own material. Fogerty also would contribute only rhythm guitar to his bandmates\' songs. Cook and Clifford, who had wanted more input in CCR\'s artistic and business decisions, resisted this arrangement. Fogerty insisted they accept the new arrangement, or he would quit the band. Despite the dissension, the trio put its new work ethic to the test in the studio, releasing the Top 10 single "[[Sweet Hitch-Hiker]]" in July 1971, backed with Stu Cook\'s "Door to Door". The band toured both the U.S. and Europe that summer and autumn, with Cook\'s song a part of the live set. In spite of their continuing commercial success, however, relations among the three had become increasingly strained.

The band\'s final album, \'\'[[Mardi Gras (album)|Mardi Gras]]\'\', was released in April 1972, featuring songs written by Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford and a cover of "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (a song [[Gene Pitney]] had originally written for [[Ricky Nelson]]). The album was a critical failure, with \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' reviewer [[Jon Landau]] deeming it "the worst album I have ever heard from a major rock band."<ref name="landau-review">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/mardi-gras-19760526 |title=Creedence Clearwater Revival: \'\'Mardi Gras\'\': Music Reviews: Rolling Stone |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=May 25, 1972 |accessdate=May 8, 2009}}</ref> The sales of \'\'Mardi Gras\'\' were weaker than previous albums, ultimately peaking at No.&nbsp;12. Fogerty\'s "[[Someday Never Comes]]", backed with Clifford\'s "Tearin\' Up the Country", also cracked the U.S. Top 40.

By this point, Fogerty was not only at direct odds with his bandmates, but had also come to see the group\'s relationship with Fantasy Records as onerous, feeling that label owner [[Saul Zaentz]] had reneged on his promise to give the band a better contract. Cook&mdash;who held a degree in business&mdash;claimed that because of poor judgment on Fogerty\'s part, CCR had to abide by the worst record deal of any major American recording artist. Despite the relatively poor reception of \'\'Mardi Gras\'\' and deteriorated relationships among the remaining band members, CCR embarked upon a two-month, 20-date U.S. tour. However, on October 16, 1972\xe2\x80\x94less than six months after the tour ended\xe2\x80\x94Fantasy Records and the band officially announced the disbanding of CCR.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7A4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22creedence+splits%22#v=onepage&q=%22creedence%20splits%22&f=false|title=Billboard \xe2\x80\x93 Google Books|publisher=Books.google.com|date=October 28, 1972|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> The band never formally reunited after the break-up, although Cook and Clifford eventually started the band [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]].

John Fogerty later commented on the demise of CCR in a 1997 Swedish magazine:
{{quote|I was alone when I made that [Creedence] music. I was alone when I made the arrangements, I was alone when I added background vocals, guitars and some other stuff. I was alone when I produced and mixed the albums. The other guys showed up only for rehearsals and the days we made the actual recordings. For me Creedence was like sitting on a time bomb. We\'d had decent successes with our cover of \'Susie Q\' and with the first album. When we went into the studio to cut \'Proud Mary,\' it was the first time we were in a real Hollywood studio, RCA\'s Los Angeles studio, and the problems started immediately. The other guys in the band insisted on writing songs for the new album, they had opinions on the arrangements, they wanted to sing. They went as far as adding background vocals to \'Proud Mary,\' and it sounded awful. They used tambourines, and it sounded no better.

That\'s when I understood I had a choice to make. At that point in time we were just a one hit wonder, and \'Susie Q\' hadn\'t really been that big a hit. Either this [the new album] would be a success, something really big, or we might as well start working at the car wash again. There was a big row. We went to an Italian restaurant and I remember that I very clearly told the others that I for one didn\'t want to go back to the car wash again. Now we had to make the best possible album and it wasn\'t important who did what, as long as the result was the very best we could achieve. And of course I was the one who should do it. I don\'t think the others really understood what I meant, but at least I could manage the situation the way I wanted. The result was eight million-selling double-sided singles in a row and six albums, all of which went platinum. And \'\'Melody Maker\'\' had us as the best band in the world. That was after the Beatles split, but still. ... And I was the one who had created all this. Despite that, I don\'t think they understood what I was talking about. ... They were obsessed with the idea of more control and more influence. So finally the bomb exploded and we never worked together again.<ref name="1997-98Interviews">{{cite web|date=|url=http://riverising.tripod.com/john-bluemoonswamp/bmsinterviews.html?stop_mobi=yes|title=Blue Moon Swamp Interview|publisher=Swedish POP Magazine|year=1997|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>}}

==Post-breakup==
===John Fogerty===
[[File:John Fogerty at the 2011 Cisco Ottawa Bluesfest.jpg|upright|thumb|John Fogerty performing in 2011]]
In 1973, Fogerty began his solo career with \'\'[[The Blue Ridge Rangers]]\'\', his one-man band collection of country and gospel songs. Under his old CCR contract, however, Fogerty owed Fantasy eight more records. In the end, he  refused to work for the label. The impasse was resolved only when [[Asylum Records]]\' [[David Geffen]] bought Fogerty\'s contract for $1,000,000. His next major hit was \'\'[[Centerfield (album)|Centerfield]]\'\', a chart-topping success in 1985. On tour in 1986, however, Fogerty suffered complaints over his steadfast refusal to perform CCR songs and suffered with recurring vocal problems which he blamed on having to testify in court. Fogerty\'s explanation for not playing CCR material songs was that he would have had to pay performance royalties to copyright holder Saul Zaentz, and that it was "too painful" to revisit the music of his past.

With the \'\'Centerfield\'\' album, Fogerty also found himself entangled in new, tit-for-tat lawsuits with Zaentz over the song "[[The Old Man Down the Road]]" which was, according to Zaentz, a blatant re-write of Fogerty\'s own 1970 CCR hit "[[Run Through the Jungle]]". Since Fogerty had traded his rights to CCR\'s songs in 1980 to cancel his remaining contractual obligations, Fantasy now owned the rights to "Run Through the Jungle" and sued Fogerty essentially for plagiarizing himself. While a jury ruled in Fogerty\'s favor, he did settle a defamation suit filed by Zaentz over the songs "Mr. Greed" and "Zanz Kant Danz". Fogerty was forced to edit the recording, changing the "Zanz" reference to "Vanz."

On February 19, 1987, at the Palomino Club in Los Angeles, Fogerty broke his self-imposed 1972 ban on performing CCR hits, on an admonition from [[Bob Dylan]] and [[George Harrison]] (who both joined him onstage) that "if you don\'t, the whole world\'s gonna think \'[[Proud Mary]]\' is [[Tina Turner]]\'s song." At a 1987 [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] benefit concert for the [[Vietnam War]], Fogerty finally ran through the list of CCR hits, beginning with "Born on the Bayou" and ending with "Proud Mary". He retreated from music again in the late 1980s but returned in 1997 with the [[Grammy]]-winning \'\'[[Blue Moon Swamp]]\'\'. Fogerty still tours frequently and performs CCR classics alongside solo material.

===Tom Fogerty===
Tom Fogerty released several solo albums, though none reached the success of CCR. Fogerty\'s 1974 solo album \'\'[[Zephyr National]]\'\' was the last to feature the four original CCR band members. Several tracks sound very much in the CCR style, particularly the aptly titled "Joyful Resurrection" on which all four members played, even though John Fogerty recorded his part separately.

Tom Fogerty died of an [[AIDS]] complication in September 1990, which he contracted via a tainted blood transfusion he received while undergoing back surgery. Tom and John never reconciled before Tom\'s death, and in the eulogy he delivered at Tom\'s funeral, John said, "We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock \'n roll stars. We didn\'t necessarily grow up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/29/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-interview|title=John Fogerty: \'I had rules.

===Stu Cook, Doug Clifford===
[[File:Creedence Clearwater Revisited in concert @ Utah (May 29).jpg|alt=|thumb|CCR\'s rhythm section formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995]]
Junior high school friends [[Doug Clifford]] and [[Stu Cook]] continued to work together following the demise of CCR both as session players and members of the [[Don Harrison Band]]. They also founded Factory Productions, a mobile recording service in the Bay Area. Clifford released a solo record, \'\'[[Cosmo (album)|Cosmo]]\'\', in 1972. Cook produced artist [[Roky Erickson]]\'s \'\'[[The Evil One]]\'\' and was bassist with the popular country act [[Southern Pacific (band)|Southern Pacific]] in the 1980s.

Doug Clifford also produced \'\'Groovers Paradise\'\' for former Sir Douglas Quintet and Texas Tornados frontman [[Doug Sahm]]. Both Clifford and Stu Cook played on the album which was released on Warner Bros. in 1974. Clifford continued to perform and record with Doug Sahm through the 1980s.

Following a relatively lengthy period of musical inactivity, Cook and Clifford formed [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] in 1995 with several well-known musicians. Revisited toured globally performing the original band\'s classics. John Fogerty\'s 1997 injunction forced Creedence Clearwater Revisited to temporarily change its name to "Cosmo\'s Factory," but the courts later ruled in Cook\'s and Clifford\'s favor.

===Fantasy Records===
After CCR, Fantasy Records released several greatest-hits packages such as 1975\'s \'\'[[Pre-Creedence]]\'\', a compilation album of The Golliwogs\' early recordings. Fantasy also released the highly successful \'\'[[Chronicle, Vol. 1]]\'\', a collection of Creedence\'s twenty hit singles, in 1976. Several years later, the label released a live recording entitled \'\'The Royal Albert Hall Concert\'\'. Contrary to its title, the 1970 performance was recorded in [[Oakland, California]], not at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London, England]]. Subsequent issues of the original 1981 album have been retitled simply \'\'[[The Concert (Creedence Clearwater Revival album)|The Concert]]\'\'.

The success of CCR made Fantasy and [[Saul Zaentz]] a great deal of money. Indeed, Fantasy built a new headquarters building in 1971 at 2600 Tenth Street in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warehamproperties.com/press/musichistory.htm|title=Wareham Development|publisher=Warehamproperties.com|date=February 13, 2007|accessdate=May 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Zaentz also used his wealth to produce a number of successful films including Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] winners \'\'[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest]]\'\', \'\'[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]\'\', and \'\'[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]\'\'. In 2004, he sold Fantasy to [[Concord Records]]. As a goodwill gesture, Concord honored the unfulfilled contractual promises Fantasy made nearly forty years earlier, finally paying the band a higher royalty rate on their sales.

One decision made by John Fogerty rankled his bandmates and would leave all without most of their hard-earned money and facing legal and financial problems for years. Without the other three band members\' knowledge, Fogerty agreed to a tax shelter scheme proposed by Saul Zaentz and his lawyers in which most of the bandmembers\' assets were transferred to [[Castle Bank & Trust (Bahamas)|Castle Bank & Trust]] of [[Nassau, Bahamas]]. Zaentz and his associates withdrew their assets before the bank eventually dissolved&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 along with the savings of the four CCR band members. A series of lawsuits began in 1978 and eventually ended with a California court awarding $8.6 million to the band members in April 1983. Despite this legal victory, very little money was recovered.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

John Fogerty, seeing that Zaentz was no longer involved with the company, also signed a new contract with Concord/Fantasy. In 2005, the label released \'\'[[The Long Road Home]]\'\', a collection of Creedence and Fogerty solo classics. After \'\'[[Revival (John Fogerty album)|Revival]]\'\' came out on the Fantasy label in October 2007 but before his following album \'\'[[Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again]]\'\' was issued in 2009, Fogerty switched from Fantasy to [[Verve Forecast Records]].

===Reunions===
The original CCR lineup rarely reunited after their breakup. All four members jammed together at Tom Fogerty\'s wedding on October 19, 1980. John Fogerty, Cook, and Clifford played at their 20th [[El Cerrito High School]] reunion in 1983, but as their original incarnation, The Blue Velvets. In the 1980s and 1990s, new rounds of lawsuits between the band members, as well as against their former management, deepened their animosities. By the time CCR was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993, John Fogerty refused to perform with Cook and Clifford. The pair were barred from the stage, while Fogerty played with an all-star band that included [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Robbie Robertson]]. Tom Fogerty\'s widow Tricia had expected a Creedence reunion, and even brought the urn containing her husband\'s ashes to the ceremony.

In a July 2011 interview with the \'\'[[Calgary Herald]]\'\', John Fogerty admitted that he would at least be willing to consider reuniting with Cook and Clifford:

{{quote|Years ago, I looked at people and I was so full of some sort of emotion and I\'d say, \'Absolutely not!\' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn\'t the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It\'s more like, \'Well, I dunno.\' Never say never is I guess is what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn\'t really kick up a big firestorm of emotion, it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking I\'d sit still long enough to listen.<ref name="heraldarticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Fortunate/5082408/story.html|title=Fortunate son|publisher=Calgary Herald|date=July 11, 2011|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>}}

When asked again in October 2011 about the prospect of a reunion, Fogerty said: "I\'m saying it\'s possible, yeah. I think the call [laughs] would maybe have to come from outside the realm. Somebody would have to get me to look at things in a fresh way."<ref name="rollingstonearticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/john-fogerty-my-anger-towards-creedence-bandmates-has-faded-20111025?stop_mobi=yes|title=John Fogerty: My Anger Towards Creedence Bandmates Has Faded|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=October 25, 2011|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}</ref>

However, Cook and Clifford both stated in the February 2012 edition of \'\'[[Uncut Magazine]]\'\' that they are not interested in a CCR reunion. "Leopards don\'t change their spots. This is just an image-polishing exercise by John. My phone certainly hasn\'t rung," Cook said. Added Clifford: "It might have been a nice idea 20 years ago, but it\'s too late."<ref name="heraldarticle">{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/03/creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion/|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival Reunion: No Chance, Drummer and Bassist Say|publisher=Spinner|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

In May 2013, Fogerty once again said he would be open to a reunion, but he does not see Cook and Clifford being willing to change their stance. He told [[Charlie Rose]] on \'\'[[CBS This Morning]]\'\': "From time to time, I\'ll say something and it\'ll get in print that maybe that will happen, and then immediately I\'ll hear back stuff that doesn\'t sound like it\'s possible. ... I think it\'s a possibility in the future, you know. It\'s not something I\'m actively seeking, but I\'m not totally against the idea either." <ref name="CBS This Morning">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505270_162-57585248/john-fogerty-creedence-clearwater-revival-reunion-a-possibility/|title=Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|publisher=John Fogerty: Creedence Clearwater Revival reunion a possibility|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref>

{{quote|Folks will remember \'\'[[Forrest Gump]]\'\' and that was a great movie, but they don\'t remember all the really poor movies that Fantasy Records stuck Creedence music into: car commercials, tire commercials.

Of particular interest was the use of his protest song "Fortunate Son" in a blue jean commercial.<ref name=aintme/> In this case, the advertiser eventually stopped using the song, as Fogerty related in a later interview:

\'\'\'Little Feat\'\'\' is an American [[Rock music|rock band]] formed by [[singer-songwriter]], [[lead vocalist]] and [[guitarist]] [[Lowell George]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]ist [[Bill Payne]] in 1969 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

Although the band has undergone several changes in its lineup, the music remains an eclectic blend of [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], [[R&B]], [[boogie-woogie|boogie]], [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[soul music|soul]], [[funk music|funk]] and [[jazz fusion]] influences.

Guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] stated Little Feat was his favorite American band in a 1975 \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' interview.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-durable-led-zeppelin-19750313?page=6 |title=The Durable Led Zeppelin &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1975-03-13 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

==History==

===Lowell George era (1969\xe2\x80\x931979)===
Lowell George met Bill Payne when George was a member of [[Frank Zappa]]\'s [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]]. Payne had [[audition]]ed for the Mothers, but had not joined. They formed Little Feat along with former Mothers\' bassist [[Roy Estrada]] and [[drummer]] [[Richie Hayward]] from George\'s previous band, the Factory. Hayward had also been a member of the [[Fraternity of Man]] whose claim to fame was the inclusion of their "Don\'t Bogart Me" on the million-selling \'\'[[Easy Rider (soundtrack)|Easy Rider]]\'\' film soundtrack. The name of the band came from a comment made by Mothers\' drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]] about Lowell\'s "little feet". The spelling of "feat" was an homage to [[the Beatles]].

There are three stories about the genesis of Little Feat. One has it that George showed Zappa his song "Willin\'," and that Zappa fired him from the Mothers of Invention, because he felt that George was too talented to merely be a member of his band, and told him he ought to go away and form his own band. The second version has Zappa firing him for playing a 15-minute guitar solo with his amplifier off. The third version says that Zappa fired him because "Willin\'" contains drug references ("weed, whites and wine"). George often introduced the song as the reason he was asked to leave the band. On October 18, 1975 at the Auditorium Theater in Rochester New York while introducing the song, George commented that he was asked to leave the band for "writing a song about dope".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/lf1975-10-18.shnf |title=Little Feat Live at Auditorium Theatre on 1975-10-18 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> 
[[File:Little Feat 1975.JPG|thumb|200px|The band in 1975]]

In any version, Zappa was instrumental in getting George and his new band a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The [[Little Feat (album)|eponymous first album]] delivered to Warner Bros. was recorded mostly in August and September 1970, and was released in January 1971. When it came time to record "Willin\'," George had hurt his hand in an accident with a model airplane, so [[Ry Cooder]] sat in and played the song\'s [[slide guitar|slide]] part. Lowell\'s accident is referenced on the cover art of the band\'s 1998 album \'\'[[Under the Radar (Little Feat album)|Under the Radar]]\'\'. "Willin\'" would be re-recorded with George playing slide for Little Feat\'s second album \'\'[[Sailin\' Shoes]]\'\', which was also the first Little Feat album to include cover art by [[Neon Park]], who had painted the cover for Zappa\'s \'\'[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]\'\'.

Sometime during the recording of the first two albums, the band members along with ex-Mothers of Invention drummer [[Jimmy Carl Black]] ("the Indian of the group") backed soul singer Nolan Porter on his first album, \'\'No Apologies\'\'.

The first two albums received nearly universal critical acclaim, and "Willin\'" became a standard, subsequently popularized by its inclusion on [[Linda Ronstadt]]\'s album \'\'[[Heart Like a Wheel]]\'\'.

Lack of commercial success led, however, to the band splitting up, with Estrada leaving to join [[Captain Beefheart]]\'s Magic Band. In 1972 Little Feat reformed, with bassist [[Kenny Gradney]] replacing Estrada. The band also added a second [[guitarist]], [[Paul Barrere]], who had known George since they attended [[Hollywood High School]] in California, and [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]] [[Sam Clayton]]. Both Barrere and Clayton added vocals on many songs, although all the band members provided [[backing vocals]] in various tunes.
[[File:Little Feat Paul Barrere and Lowell George.jpg|thumb|267px|right|L to R: [[Paul Barrere]] and [[Lowell George]], frontmen for Little Feat, 1972\xe2\x80\x931977]]
This new lineup radically altered the band\'s sound, leaning toward New Orleans funk. The group went on to record \'\'[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]\'\' (1973)\xe2\x80\x94one of the band\'s most popular albums, which incorporated [[New Orleans, Louisiana#Music|New Orleans]] musical influences and styles\xe2\x80\x94as well as \'\'[[Feats Don\'t Fail Me Now]]\'\' (1974), which was a [[Recording studio|studio]]-recorded attempt to capture some of the energy of their live shows. (The name of the latter album pays homage to the [[Fats Waller]] song.)

In 1973,  Payne, Gradney, Barrere, Clayton and George (credited as George Lowell) collaborated with jazz drummer [[Chico Hamilton]] on his [[Stax Records|Stax]] album \'\'Chico the Master\'\', which is a strong showcase for the band\'s leanings toward funk and R&B.  In 1974 Lowell George, along with [[the Meters]] and other session musicians, backed [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] on his [[Island Records]] debut solo release [[Sneakin\' Sally Through the Alley]] which opened with George\'s "Sailing Shoes."  The whole band chipped in on Palmer\'s 1975 release, [[Pressure Drop (album)|Pressure Drop]], which contained another George composition, "Trouble."  1976\'s [[Some People Can Do What They Like]], his third opus, opened with the Bill Payne/Fran Tate composition "One Last Look," and later featured Lowell\'s "Spanish Moon," although George and Kenny Gradney sat this one out.

The release of \'\'[[The Last Record Album]]\'\' in 1975 signaled another change in the Little Feat sound, with Barrere and Payne developing an interest in [[Jazz fusion|jazz-rock]]. Prior to the recording of \'\'The Last Record Album\'\', drummer [[Richie Hayward]] had a motorcycle accident and the liner to the [[LP album|LP]] release of \'\'The Last Record Album\'\' was decorated with copies of his many hospital bills. Also present was evidence of a late change to the running order of tracks: the lyrics for Barrere\'s song "Hi Roller" were printed on the sleeve, but scored out, and the words "maybe next time" scrawled over them. Sure enough, "Hi Roller" was the first track on the subsequent album \'\'[[Time Loves a Hero]]\'\'.

George continued to produce the albums, but his songwriting contribution diminished as the group moved into [[jazz fusion]], a style in which he had little interest. In August 1977, Little Feat recorded a live album from gigs at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London and [[Lisner Auditorium]] in [[Washington, DC]]. \'\'[[Waiting for Columbus]]\'\' is considered by many rock music critics to be one of the best live albums of all time, despite the fact that significant portions of George\'s vocals and slide work were over-dubbed later in the studio.<ref>Liner notes to 2002 CD re-release of \'\'Waiting for Columbus\'\'.</ref> It was released in 1978, by which time it had become apparent that Lowell George\'s interest in the band was waning, as was his health.

George did some work on what would eventually become \'\'Down on the Farm\'\' but then  declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book \'\'Written in My Soul\'\') conducted eleven days before his death, George made it clear that he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne\'s attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with [[Weather Report]] on a TV show and dropped "into one of his \'Day at the Dog Races\'. I just got out of there as fast as I could. It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barr\xc3\xa8re.<ref>\'Written in My Soul\' by Bill Flanagan ISBN 0.7119.2224.1 p.353-63</ref>

At this time Warner Bros. released George\'s only solo album, \'\'[[Thanks, I\'ll Eat It Here]]\'\', for which he had signed a contract in 1975. The album was mostly a collection of cover versions that George had been working on as a side project for several years and, in his biography, \'\'Rock And Roll Doctor\'\', Mark Brend states that George had hinted he only signed the solo contract in order to obtain funds to finance Little Feat (and Bill Flanagan states in \'\'Written in My Soul\'\' that George "didn\'t want his audience to assume a collection of other people\'s material marked the direction of Lowell George\'s solo career").

While touring in support of his solo album in June 1979, at the age of 34, George collapsed in his hotel room in Arlington, Virginia. An autopsy determined the cause of death was a [[heart attack]], although it is considered likely that George\'s excess weight, (formerly chronic) drug use, and the strain of touring contributed to his condition.

The surviving members finished and released \'\'Down on the Farm\'\' before disbanding in 1979. A subsequent retrospective [[double album]] compilation of rare outtakes and live tracks, \'\'[[Hoy-Hoy!]]\'\', was released in 1981. The album is an overview of the history and sound of Little Feat and includes a cover of the [[Hank Williams]] song "Lonesome Whistle".

Barrere, Clayton, Gradney and Hayward performed several shows as Barrere, Clayton, Gradney and Hayward in 1981 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Keiss |url=http://www.featbase.net/sidesetlists.asp?name=feats |title=Featbase Setlists |publisher=Featbase.net |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref>

Barrere then released two solo albums, 1983\'s [[On My Own Two Feet]] (Mirage) and 1984\'s [[Real Lies]] (Atlantic).  Richie Hayward was the drummer on [[Robert Plant]]\'s 1985 funk and new wave flavoured [[Shaken \'n\' Stirred]] (Es Paranza).  Payne has always been a popular and busy session musician, as well as a songwriter, and during the band\'s first hiatus performed on a variety of albums by many famous musicians including [[J.J. Cale]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Stevie Nicks]].  He was a guest performer on Raitt\'s \'\'Sweet Forgiveness\'\' in 1977, which featured his composition "Takin\' My Time."

===The Craig Fuller years (1987\xe2\x80\x931993)===
In 1986 [[Richie Hayward]], [[Paul Barrere]] and [[Bill Payne]] were invited to play on \'\'[[Blue Slipper]]\'\', the 1987 debut album by [[Helen Watson (singer / songwriter)|Helen Watson]]. They subsequently appeared on her second album \'\'[[The Weather Inside]]\'\'. The surviving former members of Little Feat then reformed in 1987 when Barrere, Clayton, Gradney, Hayward and Payne added songwriter/vocalist/guitarist [[Craig Fuller]], formerly from the band [[Pure Prairie League]], and [[Fred Tackett]] on guitar, mandolin and trumpet. The band admired Fuller\'s previous work and were impressed when he toured with them in 1978 as part of the Fuller/Kaz band. They didn\'t require an audition, having played with him on tour, and thus, the new Little Feat lineup was formed. The initial release by the new lineup, \'\'[[Let It Roll (Little Feat album)|Let It Roll]]\'\', was a tremendous success and Fuller\'s presence proved to be a major factor. His strong vocals and songwriting abilities were showcased, co-writing 8 of the 10 songs and handling a large share of lead vocals. The first single, "Hate to Lose Your Lovin\'", earned the band their first No.&nbsp;1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. All Music Guide critic Stephen Erlewine stated " What\'s surprising about Let It Roll is not just that it works, but that it works smashingly." The LP garnered Feat a certified gold record status on February 14, 1989. On the heels of this success, previous Feat releases experienced a sudden surge in sales. The February 10, 1978 live release \'\'[[Waiting for Columbus]]\'\' went certified platinum on November 8, 1989. \'\'[[Dixie Chicken (album)|Dixie Chicken]]\'\', originally released on January 25, 1973, went certified gold also on November 8, 1989. The band received more exposure than ever, including an appearance on \'\'Saturday Night Live\'\'.  Concerts were booked nationally and Little Feat played enthusiastic, sold-out shows.  Barrere, Payne and company were pleased by the audience reaction; not only were they able to put over the Feat classics, but the new music proved to be artistically and commercially successful. While some Little Feat diehards initially had difficulty accepting the band without Lowell George, the success of Little Feat with Fuller could not be disputed. The band made a comeback that introduced a whole new generation to Little Feat and reignited their past - even though their original creative genius (George) was no longer around.

The follow-up album, \'\'[[Representing the Mambo]]\'\', released in 1990 proved to be the group\'s last album for Warner Bros., who were uncomfortable with the album\'s more jazzy leanings. The third and final album by this lineup, \'\'[[Shake Me Up]]\'\' (1991) was released on [[Morgan Creek Productions|Morgan Creek]] as was the soundtrack of the 1992 film \'\'[[White Sands (film)|White Sands]]\'\', which contained one song by Little Feat called \'\'Quicksand and Lies\'\', but this label folded soon afterwards and Little Feat moved from one label to another until the establishment of [[Hot Tomato Records]] in 2002.
Fuller departed in 1993, stating that touring required too much time away from his family. He has since joined a re-formed [[Pure Prairie League]], who in 2005 released their critically acclaimed \'\'All in Good Time,\'\' which heavily featured his songwriting, singing and acoustic guitar. He has performed about 40 shows yearly with them, as well as occasional shows with Little Feat in addition to performing solo shows.

===The Shaun Murphy years (1993\xe2\x80\x932009)===
Craig Fuller was replaced by [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]] in September 1993. Shaun had sung on all of the recent Little Feat albums and throughout 1993 she had toured as part of [[Bob Seger]]\'s band with [[Fred Tackett]] and [[Bill Payne]].

Shaun\'s first album with the group was \'\'[[Ain\'t Had Enough Fun]]\'\'. As well as having material specifically written for her, for increasing fan draw attracted to her hard-edged powerhouse voice, further albums,\'\' [[Under the Radar (Little Feat album)|Under the Radar]]\'\' and \'\'[[Chinese Work Songs]]\'\' saw Murphy become an integral part of the group sharing lead vocals and writing with Payne and Barrere. Her rendition of Bob Dylan\'s "It Takes a Lot to Laugh" was first recorded in studio on \'\'[[Chinese Work Songs]]\'\', and became a favorite in live appearances with Murphy as lead singer prior to her departure in 2009.  After recording five studio albums and performing over 1,400 concerts with the band, Murphy\'s position was made redundant, and the group pared down to a six-piece collective entity. Shaun would subsequently form [[the Shaun Murphy Band]], with a specific blues-oriented niche. As of May 2011, Shaun had released two albums and returned to take her place with the Silver Bullet Band in the 2011 tour of Bob Seger, in addition to many scheduled live appearances with the Shaun Murphy Band, one of which was to release a third album and DVD, \'\'Live in Detroit\'\'.

===Hayward illness and death===
In August 2009, Richie Hayward announced that he had recently been diagnosed with a severe liver disease and would be away from work indefinitely.<ref name="Little Feat official website">{{cite web|url=http://www.littlefeat.net/index.php?page=news&n_id=599 |title=News |publisher=Little Feat |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> A benefit concert was organized<ref name="Fundraiser concert website">{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificdisturbance.com |title=Pacific Disturbance |publisher=Pacific Disturbance |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> and a website created where fans unable to attend could donate toward his treatment costs. Little Feat announced that their drum technician [[Gabe Ford]] would take his place.

Hayward married and was living on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with his liver cancer in remission as he awaited a transplant. On Sunday, July 11, 2010, Little Feat played at the Vancouver Island Music Fest and Hayward was slated to play just a couple of tunes, but once he sat behind his kit, he finished out the night. Hayward had intended to return to the band in the event of recovery, but he died on August 12, 2010, from pneumonia and complications from lung disease.

===Legacy===
Some of the prominent musicians and bands to play and record the music of Little Feat include [[Phish]],<ref>{{cite web|title=October 31, 2010 Setlist :: Phish.net|url=http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2010-10-31|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref> [[The Black Crowes]], [[The Byrds]], [[The Bridge (band)|The Bridge]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Steve Earle]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Taylor Hicks]], [[Ron Holloway]], [[Keisuke Kuwata]], [[Nicolette Larson]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Richard Shindell]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Mick Taylor]], [[Van Halen]], [[Joe Walsh]], [[Bob Weir]], [[Phil Lesh]], [[Sam Bush]], [[Coco Montoya]], [[Vince Herman]], [[Inara George]], [[Stephen Bruton]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Blackberry Smoke]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]].

In 2008, Little Feat reached their 20th anniversary as a once-again active band, and with just one lineup change since 1988. Jimmy Buffett has been an enthusiastic booster of the band for many years and his private record label was partnered with Feat\'s [[Hot Tomato Records]] to produce the CD \'\'Join the Band\'\'. Released in mid-August 2008, the album features collaborations with Buffett, [[Dave Matthews]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Bob Seger]], [[B\xc3\xa9la Fleck]], [[Brooks and Dunn]], [[Chris Robinson (singer)|Chris Robinson]] (Black Crowes), [[Vince Gill]], [[Mike Gordon]] (Phish), and [[Inara George]].

Little Feat\'s songs, "Sailin\' Shoes" and "Fat Man in the Bathtub" were featured prominently in the 2010 [[Edward Norton]] film [[Leaves of Grass (film)|Leaves of Grass]].

On October 31, 2010, at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, NJ, the band Phish covered Little Feat\'s album, \'\'Waiting for Columbus\'\', for their annual Halloween show.  As a result of this concert and the distribution of its recording, \'\'Waiting For Columbus\'\' gained recognition from a wider audience among younger listeners.

In 2012, Little Feat announced the release of their first album of new material in nine years, \'\'[[Rooster Rag]]\'\'. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

\'\'\'Lynyrd Skynyrd\'\'\'  (pronounced {{IPAc-en|\xcb\x8c|l|\xc9\x9b|n|\xc9\x99r|d|_|\xcb\x88|s|k|\xc9\xaa|n|\xc9\x99r|d}} {{respell|LEN|\xc9\x99rd|SKIN|\xc9\x99rd}}<ref>Pronunciation from album [[(Pronounced \'L\xc4\x95h-\'n\xc3\xa9rd \'Skin-\'n\xc3\xa9rd)]].</ref>) is an American [[rock music|rock]] band best known for popularizing the [[Southern rock|southern hard-rock]] genre during the 1970s. Originally formed in 1966 as \'\'The Pretty Ones\'\' in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], they then went through two name changes: \'\'The Noble Five\'\' and \'\'One Percent\'\', before coming up with Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1968. The band rose to worldwide recognition on the basis of its live performances and signature tunes "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" and "[[Free Bird]]". At the peak of their success, three members died in an [[1977 Convair CV-300 crash|airplane crash in 1977]], putting an abrupt end to the band\'s most popular incarnation.

The surviving band members re-formed in 1988 for a reunion tour with lead vocalist [[Johnny Van Zant]], the younger brother of lead singer and founder [[Ronnie Van Zant]]. The re-formed band continues to tour and record with co-founding member [[Gary Rossington]] and core members Johnny Van Zant, along with guitarist [[Rickey Medlocke]], who recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. Drummer [[Michael Cartellone]] has recorded and toured with the band since 1999. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 13, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/byyear/2006/ |title= Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Inductees by Year: 2006 |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate= April 1, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=September 2014}}

===Early years===
In the summer of 1966, teenage friends [[Ronnie Van Zant]], [[Allen Collins]], and [[Gary Rossington]] formed the earliest incarnation of the band in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] as \'\'My Backyard\'\'.  The band then changed its name to \'\'The Noble Five\'\'.<ref name=Name_Changes>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title=The Official Lynyrd Skynyrd History Website - History Lessons |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref>  The band used different names before using \'\'One Percent\'\' during 1968.<ref name=Name_Changes/>

[[File:RobertELeeHSJacksonvilleFlorida.jpg|thumb|[[Robert E. Lee High School (Jacksonville)|Robert E. Lee High School]] was where the group acquired the name Lynyrd Skynyrd from their physical-education teacher Leonard Skinner.]]
In 1969, Van Zant sought a new name. The group settled on \'\'Leonard Skinnerd\'\', a mocking tribute to a physical-education teacher at [[Robert E. Lee High School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Robert E. Lee High School]], [[Leonard Skinner]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Soergel |first=Matt |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2009/01/26/met_509196.shtml |title=Honoring a namesake |publisher=Chronicle.augusta.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref> who was notorious for strictly enforcing the school\'s policy against boys having long hair.<ref name=RELee>Robert E.

Despite their high school acrimony, the band developed a friendlier relationship with Skinner in later years, and invited him to introduce them at a concert in the [[Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum]].<ref>Namesake.</ref> Skinner also allowed the band to use a photo of his Leonard Skinner Realty sign for the inside of their third album.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leonard Skinner, Rock Band Muse, Dies at 77 |date= September 21, 2010 |accessdate= September 22, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/arts/music/21skinner.html}}</ref>

By 1970, Lynyrd Skynyrd had become a top band in Jacksonville, headlining at some local concerts, and opening for several national acts.  Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in Macon-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]\'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band\'s managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving, [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with making studio recordings.

During this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At the same time, [[Ricky Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and vocalist. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Some versions of the band\'s history also have Burns leaving the band for a short time during this period. The band played some shows with both Burns and Medlocke, using a dual-drummer approach similar to that of [[The Allman Brothers]]. In 1971, they made some recordings at the famous [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] with Walker and Medlocke serving as the rhythm section, without the participation of Burns.

Medlocke and Walker left the band to play with another southern rock band, [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], and when the band made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was featured on drums and [[Leon Wilkeson]] was Larry Junstrom\'s replacement on bass. Also in 1972, roadie [[Billy Powell]] became the keyboardist for the band. Medlocke later returned to play drums for Lynyrd Skynyrd. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until 1978, when \'\'[[Skynyrd\'s First and... Last|First and... Last]]\'\', which collected the band\'s recordings in the biennium 1971-1972, was posthumously released.

===Peak years (1973\xe2\x80\x931977)===
In 1972 the band (now Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio\'s in Atlanta.  Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label that was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album.  Leon Wilkeson temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions for the album, only playing on two tracks.  Wilkeson rejoined the band shortly after the album\'s release at Van Zant\'s invitation{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and is pictured on the album cover. [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part, which Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in "[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]"), along with some guitar work.  King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar after the album\'s release, allowing the band to replicate the three-guitar mix used in the studio for their live performances. Released August 13, 1973,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref> the self-titled album with the subtitle "Pronounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd" featured the hit song "[[Free Bird]]", which received national airplay, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] charts.

[[File:RonnieVanZant.gif|thumb|Ronnie Van Zant]]
Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s fan base continued to grow rapidly throughout 1973, largely due to their opening slot on [[The Who]]\'s \'\'[[Quadrophenia]]\'\' tour in the United States.  On their 1974 follow-up, \'\'[[Second Helping]]\'\', the band successfully avoided any sophomore slump, with King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting.  The album was the band\'s breakthrough hit, and featured their most popular single, "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" (#8 on the charts in August 1974), a response to [[Neil Young]]\'s "[[Southern Man]]", and featuring guitar work by King.  (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other\'s music and good friends; Young wrote the song "[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]" for the band, but they never recorded it.)<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> Van Zant, meanwhile, can be seen on the cover of \'\'[[Street Survivors]]\'\' and in concert wearing a Neil Young \'\'[[Tonight\'s the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight\'s the Night]]\'\' T-shirt. The album reached No.&nbsp;12 in 1974, eventually going multi-platinum.  In July of that year, Lynyrd Skynyrd was one of the headline acts at [[Ozark Music Festival, (1974)|The Ozark Music Festival]] held at the [[Missouri State Fairgrounds]] in [[Sedalia, Missouri]].

In January 1975, Burns left the band and was replaced by Kentucky native [[Artimus Pyle]] on drums. Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s third album, \'\'[[Nuthin\' Fancy]]\'\', was released the same year. This album was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Dennis|title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News|url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/docview/157771298/49CAEBCB7E4F44D3PQ/15?accountid=8360|accessdate=2014-10-03|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 1975}}</ref> The album had lower sales than its predecessor. Kooper and the band parted by mutual agreement after the raucous recording of the LP. Kooper was left with the tapes to complete the mix before release.<!-- according to Kooper in his book, Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock \'N\' Roll Survivor (1998) --> Midway through the tour, Ed King left the band, citing tour exhaustion. In January 1976, backup singers [[Leslie Hawkins]], [[Cassie Gaines]] and [[JoJo Billingsley]] (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added to the band, although they were not considered official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s fourth album \'\'[[Gimme Back My Bullets]]\'\' was released in the new year, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as [[Leslie West]], the solution was closer than they realized.

Soon after joining Skynyrd, Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, [[Steve Gaines|Steve]]. The junior Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd\'s "Saturday Night Special" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in Kansas City on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly reconstituted band recorded the double-live album \'\'[[One More from the Road]]\'\' at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)]] in Atlanta, and performed at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] festival, which also featured [[The Rolling Stones]].

Both Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington\'s accident inspired the ominous "[[That Smell]]" \xe2\x80\x93 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the "Prince Charming" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. Van Zant, at least, was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd\'s reputation.

[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|left|Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1977.]]
1977\'s \'\'[[Street Survivors]]\'\' turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them. Publicly and privately, Ronnie Van Zant marveled at the multiple talents of Skynyrd\'s newest member, claiming that the band would "all be in his shadow one day".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Gaines\' contributions included his co-lead vocal with Van Zant on the co-written "You Got That Right" and the rousing guitar boogie "I Know a Little", which he had written before he joined Skynyrd. So confident was Skynyrd\'s leader of Gaines\' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy "Ain\'t No Good Life" \xe2\x80\x93 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles "[[What\'s Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What\'s Your Name]]" and "[[That Smell]]". The band was poised for their biggest tour yet, with shows always highlighted by the iconic rock anthem "Free Bird".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/lynyrd-skynyrd |title=Freebird |publisher=Wolfgangsvault.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref> In November, the band was scheduled to fulfill Van Zant\'s lifelong dream of headlining New York\'s [[Madison Square Garden]].

The song "Freebird" in the movie \'\'[[Freebird... The Movie]]\'\' was actually filmed on July 2, 1977 at the [[Oakland Coliseum]] and not on July 4 as stated by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] and in the credits.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Plane crash (1977)===
{{Main|1977 Convair CV-300 crash}}

Following a performance at the [[Greenville Memorial Auditorium]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], on October 20, 1977 the band boarded a chartered [[Convair CV-240 family#Variants|Convair CV-300]] to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] where they were scheduled to appear at [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] the following night. Due to a faulty engine, the airplane ran low on fuel and the pilots were diverted to the [[McComb-Pike County Airport]].  After running out of fuel they attempted an emergency landing before crashing in a heavily forested area five miles northeast of [[Gillsburg, Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19771020-1&lang=en |title=Accident report, N55VM (10/20/77) |publisher=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR78-06.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report L and J Company, Convair 248, N55, Gillsburg, Mississippi, October 20, 1977 |publisher= libraryonline.erau.edu |date= June 19, 1978 |accessdate= March 25, 2014 |work=U.S. National Transportation Safety Board}}</ref> Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, Cassie Gaines, assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary, and co-pilot William Gray were killed on impact; the other band members (Collins, Rossington, Wilkeson, Powell, Pyle, and Hawkins), tour manager Ron Eckerman,<ref>[http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/168499 Smashwords \xe2\x80\x94 Turn It Up! \xe2\x80\x94 A book by Ron Eckerman]. Smashwords.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-15.</ref> and road crew suffered serious injuries.

The accident came just three days after the release of \'\'[[Street Survivors]]\'\'. Following the crash and the ensuing press, \'\'Street Survivors\'\' became the band\'s second platinum album and reached No.&nbsp;5 on the U.S. album chart. The single "What\'s Your Name" reached No.&nbsp;13 on the single airplay charts in January 1978.  The original cover sleeve for \'\'Street Survivors\'\' had featured a photograph of the band, particularly Steve Gaines, engulfed in flames. Out of respect for the deceased (and at the request of Teresa Gaines, Steve\'s widow), MCA Records withdrew the original cover and replaced it with a similar image of the band against a simple black background.<ref name=Check-Six>{{cite web |title=The \'Lynyrd Skynyrd\' Crash |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/LynyrdSkynyrd-N55VM.htm |work=Check-Six.com |date=May 2007 |accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Thirty years later, for the deluxe CD version of \'\'Street Survivors\'\', the original "flames" cover was restored.

Lynyrd Skynyrd disbanded after the tragedy, reuniting just once to perform an instrumental version of "Free Bird" at Charlie Daniels\' [[Volunteer Jam]] V in January 1979. Collins, Rossington, Powell and Pyle performed the song with [[Charlie Daniels]] and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.

===Hiatus (1977\xe2\x80\x931987)===
Rossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed [[The Rossington-Collins Band]], which released two albums between 1980 and 1983. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, [[Dale Krantz]], as lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgment of their past, the band\'s concert encore would always be an instrumental version of "Free Bird". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s and opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\xe2\x80\x931988.

The other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian Rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell\'s trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash. Pyle formed The Artimus Pyle Band in 1982, which occasionally featured former Honkettes [[JoJo Billingsley]] and [[Leslie Hawkins]].

In 1980, Allen Collins\' wife Kathy died of a massive hemorrhage while [[Miscarriage|miscarrying]] their third child. He formed the [[Allen Collins Band]] in 1983 from the remnants of the Rossington-Collins Band and released one tepidly-received album, but many around him believed that the guitarist\'s heart just was not in it anymore. Most point to his wife\'s death as the moment that Collins\' life began to spin out of control; he spent several years binging on drugs and alcohol. In 1986, Collins crashed his car while driving drunk near his home in Jacksonville, killing his girlfriend and leaving himself permanently paralyzed from the chest down. Collins eventually pled no contest to DUI manslaughter, but was not given a prison sentence since his injuries made it obvious that he would never drive or be a danger to society again.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Return (1987\xe2\x80\x93present)===
In 1987, Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for a full-scale tour with five major members of the pre-crash band: crash survivors Gary Rossington, Billy Powell, Leon Wilkeson and Artimus Pyle, along with guitarist Ed King, who had left the band two years before the crash. Ronnie Van Zant\'s younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to Collins\' paralysis from a 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. As part of his plea deal, Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of "That Smell", which had been partially directed at him). Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990.

The reunited band was meant to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album \'\'[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987\'\'. The fact that the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not "exploit" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band\'s touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso which forces any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include at least three from the pre-crash era. As the years have gone on, however, and continued lineup changes occurred for various reasons, this so-called "rule of three" was eventually no longer made a requirement.

The reconstituted Lynyrd Skynyrd has gone through a large number of lineup changes and continues to record and tour today. One by one, the members of the pre-crash band have left, been forced out, or have died. Artimus Pyle left the band in 1991 and his place has been taken by a variety of drummers since, with [[Michael Cartellone]] finally becoming his permanent replacement. Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes in 1993. Ed King had to take a break from touring in 1996. In his absence, he was replaced by [[Hughie Thomasson]]. The band did not let King rejoin after he recovered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} At the same time, Mike Estes was replaced by [[Rickey Medlocke]], who was briefly the second drummer and a vocalist (playing also mandolin) with the band in the early 1970s. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd\'s bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001; his death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/>

The remaining members released a double collection album called \'\'[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]\'\', which had songs from the original lineup to the present. Lynyrd Skynyrd also released a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd released the album \'\'[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]\'\'. On December 10, 2004, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]], \'\'Crossroads\'\', a concert featuring country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]] and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 [[Hughie Thomasson]] left the band to reform his disbanded Southern Rock band [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]]. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida. He was 55 years old.

On February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party in Jacksonville with special guests [[3 Doors Down]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant\'s brother [[Donnie Van Zant]] of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Dickey Betts]]. In the summer of 2005, lead singer [[Johnny Van Zant]] had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], with [[Kid Rock]] standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour. The concert was recorded in high definition for HDNet and premiered on December 1, 2007.

[[Mark Matejka|Mark "Sparky" Matejka]], formerly of the country music band [[Hot Apple Pie]], joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 2006 as Thomasson\'s replacement. On November 2, 2007, the band performed at the University of Florida\'s [[Gator Growl]], the world\'s largest student-run pep rally, in [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] \xe2\x80\x93 also known as "The Swamp". The event\'s 50,000-person attendance marked the largest crowd that Lynyrd Skynyrd had ever played in front of in the U.S., until the July 2008 Bama Jam in Enterprise, Alabama where more than 111,000 people were in attendance.<ref name=Kirkland>Kirkland 2008.</ref>

On January 28, 2009, keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] died of a suspected heart attack at age 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida. No autopsy was ever carried out. Powell\'s death left Gary Rossington as the sole pre-crash member still in the band, unless Rickey Medlocke\'s brief stint with the band in the early 1970s is counted.

On March 17, 2009, it was announced that Skynyrd had signed a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records, in association with their label, Loud & Proud Records, and released their new album \'\'[[God & Guns]]\'\' on September 29 of that year. They toured Europe and the U.S. in 2009 with [[Peter Keys]] of the 420 Funk Mob on keyboards and [[Robert Kearns (musician)|Robert Kearns]] of [[The Bottle Rockets]] on bass; bassist Ean Evans died of cancer at age 48 on May 6, 2009.<ref name=Evans_death>Kaufman, Gil.

In addition to the tour, Skynyrd appeared at the [[Sean Hannity]] [[Sean Hannity#FreedomConcerts|Freedom Concert]] series in late 2010. Hannity had been actively promoting the \'\'God & Guns\'\' album, frequently playing portions of the track "That Ain\'t My America" on his radio show. The tour is titled "Rebels and Bandoleros". The band continued to tour throughout 2011, playing alongside [[ZZ Top]] and [[The Doobie Brothers]].

On May 2, 2012, the band announced the impending release of a new studio album, \'\'[[Last of a Dyin\' Breed]]\'\', along with a North American and European tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/lynyrd-skynyrd-to-release-last-of-a-dying-breed-announce-2012-tour/ |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd to Release \xe2\x80\x98Last Of A Dying Breed,\xe2\x80\x99 Announce 2012 Tour |publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=May 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |archivedate=May 8, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67WJz5I2p}}</ref> On August 21, 2012, \'\'Last of a Dyin\' Breed\'\' was released.

While promoting the album on CNN on September 9, 2012, members of the band talked about its discontinued use of Confederate imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/09/lynyrd-skynyrd-talks-southern-roots/ |title=LYNYRD SKYNYRD Talks Southern Roots |publisher=cnn.com |date= September 9, 2012}}</ref> In September 2012, the band briefly did not display the [[Confederate Flag]], which had for years been a part of their stage show, because they did not want to be associated with racists who had adopted the flag. After protests from fans they reversed this decision, noting it is part of their Southern American heritage and [[states rights]] symbolism.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/Fans-outrage-prompts-Lynyrd-Skynyrd-to-keep-3892152.php Fans\' outrage prompts Lynyrd Skynyrd to keep Confederate flag].

===Early years & self-titled album===
Theory of a Deadman became the first act to sign with [[Nickelback]] frontman [[Chad Kroeger]]\'s [[604 Records]] imprint in 2001. Tyler Connolly (vocals, guitar; born August 26, 1975) reportedly slipped a copy of the band\'s demo (which would become the song "Invisible Man") to Kroeger at a post-concert party and the two were soon collaborating on songs together. They released their eponymous debut album \'\'[[Theory of a Deadman (album)|Theory of a Deadman]]\'\' on September 17, 2002. The name of the band comes from a song off their first album, whose lyrics describe a man preparing to commit suicide. That track was renamed to "[[The Last Song (Theory of a Deadman song)|The Last Song]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rock.about.com/od/theoryofadeadman/p/theory.htm

==Music career==

===Early career===
Adkins\' first single, "There\'s a Girl in Texas", was released in 1996, reaching the Top 20 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. It was followed by the release of his debut album, \'\'[[Dreamin\' Out Loud]]\'\', later that year. The album produced several hit singles, including his first Top 5 single, "[[Every Light in the House]]", his first Number One in "[[(This Ain\'t) No Thinkin\' Thing]]", and another Top 5 hit in "[[I Left Something Turned on at Home]]". The latter single was also a Number One hit in Canada. His second album, \'\'[[Big Time (Trace Adkins album)|Big Time]]\'\', produced a Top 5 in "[[The Rest of Mine]]", but subsequent singles proved less successful.<ref name="billboard"/> A change in management delayed the release of Adkins\' third album,<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward Morris |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080327010935/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1445103/20010712/adkins_trace.jhtml |title=CMT.com : Trace Adkins : Trace Adkins Nixed Song That\'s Now His Album\'s Lead Single |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-07-12 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}</ref> but the album (titled \'\'[[More... (Trace Adkins album)|More...]]\'\') was eventually released in late 1999. Although the album\'s title track reached Top 10, \'\'More...\'\' failed to achieve gold status.

===2001\xe2\x80\x932004===
In 2001, Adkins was injured in a tractor accident and had to temporarily cancel touring.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1458085/20021011/adkins_trace.jhtml ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> He later entered a 28-day alcohol rehabilitation program in Nashville<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1459611/20030121/adkins_trace.jhtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424172232/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1459611/20030121/adkins_trace.jhtml |archivedate=2008-04-24 |title=CMT.com : Trace Adkins : Trace Adkins Completes Rehab Program |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}</ref> shortly after the release of his \'\'[[Chrome (Trace Adkins album)|Chrome]]\'\' album. \'\'Chrome\'\' was his first album to reach the Top 5 on the country albums charts; its [[Chrome (Trace Adkins song)|title track]] reached Top 10 in late 2002.<ref name="billboard"/>

In 2003, Adkins released two albums\xe2\x80\x94a Greatest Hits collection and \'\'[[Comin\' on Strong]]\'\'.<ref name="billboard"/> The same year, he was inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1472693/20030616/adkins_trace.jhtml ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> He also made appearances as the center square on the game show [[Hollywood Squares]],<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1483835/20031219/adkins_trace.jhtml ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> and did voice-overs in commercials for fast-food chain [[KFC]].<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1485535/20040303/adkins_trace.jhtml ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> Only one single, "[[Then They Do]]", was released from this Greatest Hits compilation. This album, which succeeded the Greatest Hits collection, produced two singles: the Top 5 single "[[Hot Mama]]" and "[[Rough & Ready]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;13.

Adkins and [[Travis Tritt]] played the roles of prison convicts in a February 2004 episode of the television series \'\'[[Yes, Dear]]\'\' ([[Greg and Jimmy\'s Criminals|Greg & Jimmy\'s Criminals]]).

===2005\xe2\x80\x932007===
In 2005, Adkins released his next album entitled \'\'[[Songs About Me]]\'\'.<ref name="billboard"/> The [[Songs About Me (song)|title track]] was released as its first single in December 2004. The album\'s second single, "[[Arlington (song)|Arlington]]", generated controversy over its content (a first-person account of a fictional soldier who was about to be buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]).<ref>[http://www.usaweekend.com/06_issues/060521/060521country_music.html USA WEEKEND Magazine]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> It was followed by "[[Honky Tonk Badonkadonk]]",  which became a highly successful crossover hit, bringing Adkins into the Top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] for the first time.

2006 saw the release of Adkins\' seventh studio album, \'\'[[Dangerous Man]]\'\'. "[[Swing (Trace Adkins song)|Swing]]", the album\'s lead-off single, peaked at No.&nbsp;20, while the follow-up "[[Ladies Love Country Boys]]" became Adkins\' second Number One single on the country charts and his first since "(This Ain\'t) No Thinkin\' Thing" in 1997. The album\'s final release, "I Wanna Feel Something", proved unsuccessful on the charts; as a result, Adkins announced that he would stop supporting the single.

In August 2007, Adkins released a single entitled "[[I Got My Game On]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050617/adkins-impatient-to-unveil-new-single-album |title=Adkins Impatient To Unveil New Single, Album |accessdate=2007-07-26 |last=Benson |first=John |work= Billboard.com}}</ref> Originally, the song was planned to be the lead-off to a new album, tentatively titled \'\'Game On\'\'; however, Adkins decided not to release a full album, and instead released his second Greatest Hits compilation, \'\'[[American Man: Greatest Hits Volume II]]\'\', for which "I Got My Game On" served as the lead-off single.<ref name="game">{{cite web |url=http://www.countryondemand.com/news/2007/10/trace-and-trump.shtml

===2008&ndash;present===
In November 2008, Trace Adkins made an appearance at the [[Macy\'s|Macy]]\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Trace rode with his family on the "[[Jimmy Dean]]" float and performed his popular song "You\'re Gonna Miss This." In 2009, Adkins appeared in local [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] commercials to advertise season tickets and the 50th season of the [[National Football League]]\'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

Adkins recorded a duet with country legend [[Ronnie Milsap]] called "My First Ride" to benefit fire-fighters and police officers in the US and [[Canada]]. Then, after the song\'s release the label said \'no\' to radio stations playing it with no explanation given. Milsap led a protest at [[Capitol Records]] to "Free Trace" and allow the song to be played.

In November 2009, Adkins embarked on the [[Shine All Night Tour]], a co-headling venture with fellow country artist [[Martina McBride]]. Also in 2009, Adkins joined fellow country artist [[Blake Shelton]] in recording a duet titled "Hillbilly Bone," which was released as the lead-off single from Shelton\'s upcoming sixth album.

On October 18, 2009, Trace made an appearance on [[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]] to help [[Ty Pennington]] and his design team build a new home for the Marshall family.

Two men in a small pickup truck lost their lives after crashing into one of Trace Adkins\' tour buses. The truck was believed to have crossed the "no passing" line in the center of the road which resulted in the crash. Several members of Adkins\' band were aboard the bus, but did not suffer any major injuries. Adkins himself was not on board the bus at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/02/13/trace-adkins-tour-bus-fatal-crash|title=Trace Adkins\' Tour Bus Involved in Fatal Crash|date=13 February 2010| publisher= \'\'[[TMZ.com|TMZ]]\'\'|accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref>

}}
\'\'\'Alabama\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[country music|country]], [[Southern rock]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]] in 1969. The band was founded by [[Randy Owen]] ([[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]) and his cousin [[Teddy Gentry]] ([[bass guitar]], [[background vocals]]), soon joined by their other cousin, [[Jeff Cook]] ([[lead guitar]], [[fiddle]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]). First operating under the name Wildcountry, the group toured the [[Southeast United States|Southeast]] bar circuit in the early 1970s, and began writing original songs. They changed their name to Alabama in 1977 and following the chart success of two singles, were approached by [[RCA Records]] for a record deal.

Alabama\'s biggest success came in the 1980s, where the band had over 27 number one hits, seven multi-platinum albums and received numerous awards. Alabama\'s first single on RCA Records, "[[Tennessee River (song)|Tennessee River]]", began a streak of number one singles, including "[[Love in the First Degree (Alabama song)|Love in the First Degree]]" (1981), "[[Mountain Music (song)|Mountain Music]]" (1982), "[[Dixieland Delight]]" (1983), "[[If You\'re Gonna Play in Texas (You Gotta Have a Fiddle in the Band)]]" (1984) and "[[Song of the South (song)|Song of the South]]" (1987). The group\'s popularity waned slightly in the 1990s, although they continued to receive hit singles and multi-platinum record sales. Alabama disbanded in 2006 following a farewell tour and two albums of inspirational music, but reunited in 2011 and have continued to record and tour worldwide.

The band\'s blend of traditional country music and [[Southern rock]] combined with elements of [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[pop music]] gave it a [[crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal that helped lead to their success.  They also [[concert|toured]] extensively and incorporated production elements such as lighting and "sets" inspired by [[rock concert]]s into their shows.  The band has over 30 number one country records on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' charts to their credit and have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\'s best-selling bands of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2014/10/post_272.html|title=Teddy Gentry of the group Alabama will sing his songs and tell stories behind them at Samford University|publisher=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=October 3, 2014|first=Cary|last=Estes|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] credited the band with popularizing the idea of a country band, and wrote that "it\'s unlikely that any other country group will be able to surpass the success of Alabama."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=6}}  In addition to this accomplishment, they are also one of the world\'s best-selling bands of all time, a statistic that includes all genres of music, not just country.

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1969\xe2\x80\x9379===
[[Image:FortPayneAir.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alabama formed in [[Fort Payne, Alabama]], seen here in 1999.]]

==Musical style and influences==
Alabama\'s music mixes both country, rock, and pop, particularly evident in their musical concept: the group were one of the first country bands to achieve significant airplay.{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Despite their influences from other genres, the band were most inspired by country music, which are most evident in their "harmonies, songwriting, and approach."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band are "indebted to country, particularly the [[Bakersfield sound]] of [[Merle Haggard]], bluegrass, and the sound of [[country pop|Nashville pop]]."{{sfn|Erlewine|Woodstra|Bogdanov|Erlewine|1997|p=3}} The band echoed their country upbringing in one of their first trade articles: "We\'re country first and crossover second. If crossovers come, that\'s great, but we\'d rather have a No. 1. country song than be lost in the middle of both country and pop charts," said Owen.<ref name=billboard2>{{cite journal| last =Wells| first =Robyn| date =December 13, 1980| title =Alabama Makes Its Mark| journal =[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| volume =92| issue = 50| page = | publisher =[[Prometheus Global Media]]| location =[[New York City]]| issn =0006-2510| url = }}</ref>

By the mid-1980s, the band increasingly moved toward a general [[pop-rock]] sound, "going for splashier productions with a more heavily amplified sound."<ref name=BiographicalDictionary>Carlin, Richard. (2002). \'\'Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary\'\'. [[London]]: [[Routledge]], 540 pp. First edition, 2002.</ref> Alabama\'s lyrics often centered around their homeland. Their first hit single, "Tennessee River", recounts being "born across the river in the mountains I call home," while "Dixieland Delight" chronicles cruising down a rural Tennessee [[Byway (road)|byway]].<ref name="tenn"/>

===Awards===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Alabama}}
Alabama are the most awarded band in the history of country music, with over 200 awards from a variety of organizations.<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1981, Alabama won both the Vocal Group of the Year and Instrumental Group of the Year honors from the CMAs. It also won the ACM\'s Vocal Group of the Year award, and \'\'Billboard\'\'{{\'s}} New Group of the Year honors. The group won the CMA\'s prestigious Entertainer of the Year award for three consecutive years (1982\xe2\x80\x9384), and the ACM\'s Entertainer of the Year award five times (1982\xe2\x80\x9386).<ref name="billboard1"/> In 1989, Alabama was named Artist of the Decade by the ACM.

==Legacy==

===Impact===
Alabama has been credited with "substantially broadening country\'s audience while becoming one of the most popular acts in American musical history" by Michael McCall of \'\'The Encyclopedia of Country Music\'\'.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}} The band was notable for its three-person lead (as "most other country acts focused on a soloist accompanied by an anonymous band"), their collective hair length and facial hair (which would have been deemed unacceptable just a decade earlier), and their prominent electric bass and drums.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> They had a slightly edgier sound than other groups, and both played their own instruments and wrote their own songs.<ref name="tenn"/> Alabama mostly appealed to a younger audience, although their clean-cut image appealed to the more [[conservative]], older country audience as well.<ref name="BiographicalDictionary"/> Kurt Wolff described the band\'s appeal: "They\'re just rebel enough for the young folks, but their parents also dig the boys\' pretty harmonies, sentimental soft spots, and old-fashioned family values."<ref name=wolff>Wolff, Kurt. (2000). \'\'Country Music: The Rough Guide\'\'. Rough Guides, 608 pp. First edition, 2000.</ref> Alabama gave prominence to their hometown of Fort Payne, and also raised awareness for environmental issues.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}}

The band\'s incorporation of rock and roll into their sound was an inspiration for groups such as [[Restless Heart]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], [[Exile (American band)|Exile]], [[Diamond Rio]], [[Lonestar]], [[Ricochet (band)|Ricochet]], and [[the Mavericks]].{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=5}}<ref name="billboard1"/> According to Irwin Stambler and Grelun Landon, authors of \'\'Country Music: The Encyclopedia\'\', the group\'s diminishing sales in the late 1980s reflected competition from country bands that would not have received recognition had it not been for Alabama paving the way. For their part, these groups credited Alabama with providing a massive influence on their careers.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=6}} Prior to Alabama\'s unprecedented chart success, most country hit singles belonged to solo artists or duets.{{sfn|Stambler|Landon|2000|p=5}} Many Alabama singles and albums represented crossover appeal on the pop charts.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}}

Despite their successes, Alabama\'s career was loathed by music critics of the day, citing the "vacuous songs and watered-down, middle-of-the-road arrangements" that blurred lines between country and pop.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} \'\'[[The Baltimore Sun]]\'\' once argued the band "render[s] country music all but indistinguishable from pop" and thus "trivializes some of country\'s most hallowed traditions."{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|p=8}} Indeed, reviewers such as Wolff consider the band\'s "overriding problem" their calculated sound, which leads many contemporary music critics to label the band mediocre.<ref name="wolff"/>

===Philanthropy===
Beginning in 1982 and continuing until 1997, Alabama sponsored the June Jam, a music festival in Fort Payne, which at its peak drew 60,000 fans and raised millions for local charities.{{sfn|McCall|Rumble|Kingsbury|2012|p=6}} The group also held "Fan Appreciation Days," weekend events that included a golf tournament and a songwriters concert that raised money for charities in Fort Payne.<ref name="billboard1"/> Owen spearheaded "Country Cares for Kids," an annual country [[Telethon|radiothon]] that raised over $70 million for [[St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name="billboard1"/>

\'\'\'Big & Rich\'\'\' is an American [[country music]] duo composed of [[Big Kenny]] and [[John Rich]], both of whom are songwriters, vocalists, and guitarists. Rich was a founding member of the country music band [[Lonestar]] and later a solo artist for [[BNA Records]], while Big Kenny was formerly a solo artist on [[Hollywood Records]].

Big & Rich\'s first studio album, \'\'[[Horse of a Different Color (Big & Rich album)|Horse of a Different Color]]\'\', was released in 2004. This album produced four straight Top 40 country hits, including the number 11 "[[Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)]]", plus collaborations with [[Cowboy Troy]], [[Gretchen Wilson]], and [[Martina McBride]]. \'\'[[Comin\' to Your City]]\'\', released in November 2005, added another top-20 single, the [[Vietnam War]]-inspired "[[8th of November (song)|8th of November]]", and two more top 40 hits. Joining the duo on this album were Cowboy Troy, Wilson, and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. 2007\'s \'\'[[Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace]]\'\' produced the duo\'s first number-one single, "[[Lost in This Moment]]". Both before and during the duo\'s hiatus, Rich has worked as a producer and songwriter for several other artists.

After this album, both members went on hiatus and released solo albums in 2009: Rich\'s \'\'[[Son of a Preacher Man (album)|Son of a Preacher Man]]\'\' and Big Kenny\'s \'\'[[The Quiet Times of a Rock and Roll Farm Boy]]\'\'. These also produced the duo\'s first top 40 solo entries: Rich with "[[Shuttin\' Detroit Down]]" and Big Kenny with "[[Long After I\'m Gone]]".  In 2010, Kenny released his second solo country album, \'\'[[Big Kenny\'s Love Everybody Traveling Musical Medicine Show Mix Tape, Vol. 1]]\'\'.  In 2011, Rich released the [[extended play]]s \'\'[[For the Kids (EP)|For the Kids]]\'\' and \'\'[[Rich Rocks]]\'\', the latter of which included the Top 40 country single "Country Done Come to Town". Big & Rich reunited in May 2011 to release "Fake ID", a cut from the soundtrack to the 2011 film \'\'[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]\'\'. A year later, the duo released its fourth album, \'\'[[Hillbilly Jedi]]\'\', which produced the Top 20 hit "[[That\'s Why I Pray]].  In July 2013, Rich announced that the duo had begun work on their fifth studio album, titled \'\'[[Gravity (Big & Rich album)|Gravity]]\'\'.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|author= |url=http://theboot.com/big-and-rich-new-studio-album/?trackback=fbshare_top |title=Big & Rich Working on New Studio Album |publisher=Theboot.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://e2.ma/message/5e6mg/5qzdaj |title=email : Webview : Big News from Big & Rich! |publisher=E2.ma |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>  In January 2014, the lead off single to the album, titled "[[Look at You (Big & Rich song)|Look at You]]", was released.<ref name="apple1">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/look-at-you/id797028801?i=797028808 |title=iTunes - Music - Look at You - Single by Big & Rich |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2014-01-28 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>

[[File:Jimmy Buffett on USS Harry S Truman.jpg|Jimmy Buffett aboard USS \'\'Harry S Truman\'\', January 2008|thumb]]
\'\'\'James William\'\'\' "\'\'\'Jimmy\'\'\'" \'\'\'Buffett\'\'\' (born December 25, 1946) is an American singer&ndash;songwriter, author, actor, and businessman. He is best known for his music, which often portrays an "island escapism" lifestyle, and the often humorous things he has experienced throughout his life. Together with his [[Coral Reefer Band]], Buffett has recorded hit songs including "[[Margaritaville]]" (ranked 234th on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America\'s]] list of "[[Songs of the Century]]") and "[[Come Monday]]". He has a devoted base of [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] known as "[[Parrothead]]s".

Aside from his career in music, Buffett is also a best-selling writer and is involved in two restaurant chains named after two of his best-known songs, "[[Cheeseburger in Paradise]]" and "Margaritaville". He owns the [[Jimmy Buffett\'s Margaritaville|Margaritaville Cafe]] restaurant chain and co-developed the [[Cheeseburger in Paradise (restaurant)|Cheeseburger in Paradise]] restaurant concept with [[OSI Restaurant Partners]] (parent of [[Outback Steakhouse]]), which operates the chain under a licensing agreement with Buffett.

== Personal life ==
Buffett was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and spent part of his childhood in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He is the son of Mary Lorraine (n\xc3\xa9e Peets) and James Delaney Buffett, Jr.<ref>Eng, S.: \'\'Jimmy Buffett: The Man from Georgia Revealed\'\', page&nbsp;39. St. Martin\'s Press, 1996.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/announcements/obituaries/james-delaney-buffett-jr-j-d/article_712b0b32-2fc9-5e75-85ed-5e7feac0d97c.html |title=James Delaney Buffett, Jr. "J.D." |publisher=Billingsgazette.com |date=2003-05-02 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=56127042 |title=Mary Loraine "Peets" Buffett (1921\xe2\x80\x932003) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> In grade school years, he attended St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone in the school band. He later lived in [[Fairhope, Alabama]], mentioned by him as his "Home Town" during a 2001 concert. He graduated from McGill Institute for Boys (now [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School]]) in 1964. He began playing guitar during his freshman year at [[Auburn University]] before continuing his college years at [[Pearl River Community College]] and [[The University of Southern Mississippi]] in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], where he received a bachelor\'s degree in history in 1969. He was initiated into the fraternity [[Kappa Sigma]] ([[Kappa Sigma|\xce\x9a\xce\xa3]]) at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]]. After graduating from college, Buffett worked as a correspondent for [[Billboard Magazine|\'\'Billboard\'\' magazine]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], breaking the news of the separation of [[Flatt and Scruggs]].

Buffett married Margie Washichek in 1969; they divorced in 1972. Buffett and his second wife, Jane (n\xc3\xa9e Slagsvol) have two daughters, Savannah Jane and Sarah Delaney, and an adopted son, Cameron Marley, and reside in [[Sag Harbor, New York]]. They separated in the early 1980s but reconciled in 1991. Buffett also owns a home in [[Saint Barth\xc3\xa9lemy|St Barts]], a Caribbean island where he lived on and off in the early 1980s while he was part-owner of the Autour de Rocher hotel and restaurant. He spends part of the summer traveling about the East Coast on his sailboat. An avid pilot, Buffett\'s flagship plane is a [[Dassault Falcon 900]] that he often uses while on concert tour and traveling worldwide. He has also owned a [[Boeing Stearman]], [[Lake Amphibian]] and [[Grumman Albatross]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|date=May 2014|page=79|title=A Plane-Crazy America}}</ref>

His father died May 1, 2003 at the age of 83. His mother died a few months after her husband, on September 25, 2003.

==Music==

===Music career===
Buffett began his musical career in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], during the late 1960s as a [[country music|country]] artist and recorded his first album, the [[folk rock]] \'\'[[Down to Earth (Jimmy Buffett album)|Down to Earth]],\'\' in 1970. During this time, Buffett could be frequently found [[busking]] for tourists in New Orleans. [[Country music]] singer [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] took him to [[Key West]] on a busking expedition in November, 1971.<ref>{{cite book|last=Corcoran|first=Tom|title=Jimmy Buffett The Key West Years|year=2006|publisher=Ketch & Yawl Press|location=Marathon FL|isbn=978-0-9788949-0-0|page=9}}</ref> Buffett then moved to Key West and began establishing the easy-going beach-bum persona for which he is known. Following this move, Buffett combined country, folk, and pop music with coastal as well as tropical lyrical themes for a sound sometimes called "[[gulf and western (music genre)|gulf and western]]". Today, he is a regular visitor to the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Saint Barts]] and other islands where he gets inspiration for many of his songs and some of the characters in his books.

Buffett\'s third album was the 1973 \'\'[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]\'\'. Albums \'\'[[Living & Dying in 3/4 Time]]\'\' and \'\'[[A1A (album)|A1A]]\'\' both followed in 1974, \'\'[[Havana Daydreamin\']]\'\' appeared in 1976, and \'\'[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]],\'\' followed in 1977 and featured the breakthrough hit song "[[Margaritaville]]".

With the untimely death of friend and mentor [[Jim Croce]] in September 1973, ABC Dunhill tapped Buffett to fill his space. Earlier, Buffett had visited Croce\'s farm in Pennsylvania and met with Croce in Florida.<ref>Steve Eng. \'\'The Man from Margaritaville Revealed.\'\' Page 144.</ref><ref>Mark Humphrey. \'\'Jimmy Buffett Scrap Book.\'\' Page 120.</ref>

During the 1980s, Buffett made far more money from his tours than his albums and became known as a popular concert draw. He released a series of albums during the following twenty years, primarily to his devoted audience, and also branched into writing and merchandising. In 1985, Buffett opened a "Margaritaville" retail store in Key West, and in 1987, the Margaritaville Cafe was opened. During the 1980s, Buffett played at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]]. He briefly changed the name of the band from the "[[Coral Reefer Band]]" to the "Coral Reef Band" to honor the HLS&R\'s request; they thought "Reefers" was a drug-related reference. HLS&R is a charity event that provides student grants to children and young adults who compete in agriculture contests (FFA).

Two of the more out-of-character albums are \'\'[[Christmas Island (album)|Christmas Island]],\'\' a collection of Christmas songs, and \'\'Parakeets,\'\' a collection of Buffett songs sung by children and containing "cleaned-up" lyrics (like "a cold [[root beer]]" instead of "a cold [[draft beer]]").

In 1997, Buffett collaborated with novelist [[Herman Wouk]] to create a short-lived musical based on Wouk\'s novel, \'\'[[Don\'t Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don\'t Stop the Carnival]]\'\'. Broadway showed little interest in the play, (following the failure of Paul Simon\'s \'\'[[The Capeman]]\'\'), and it ran only for six weeks in [[Miami]]. He released an album of songs from the musical in 1998.

In August 2000, Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band played on the White House lawn for then President Bill Clinton.

In 2003, he partnered in a partial [[duet]] with [[Alan Jackson]] for the song "[[It\'s Five O\'Clock Somewhere (song)|It\'s Five O\'Clock Somewhere]]", a number-one hit on the country charts. This song won the 2003 [[Country Music Association]] Award for Vocal Event of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaawards.com/2007/history/ |title=History &#124; CMA AwardsCMA Awards |publisher=Cmaawards.com |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> This was Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s first award of any kind in his 30-year career.

Buffett\'s album, \'\'[[License to Chill]]\'\', released on July 13, 2004, sold 238,600 copies in its first week of release according to [[Nielsen Soundscan|Nielsen SoundScan]]. With this, Buffett topped the U.S. pop albums chart for the first time in his three-decade career.

Buffett continues to tour throughout the year although he has shifted recently to a more relaxed schedule of around 20\xe2\x80\x9330 dates, with infrequent back-to-back nights, preferring to play only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The title of his 1999 live album reflects this: \'\'[[Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays]]\'\'. Purchasing tickets is difficult, with most of his concerts selling out in minutes.

In the summer of 2005 Buffett teamed up with Sirius radio and introduced [[Radio Margaritaville]], and as of November 2008 is also on XM radio channel 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siriusxm.com/channellineup# |title=Channel Lineup - SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> Until this point Radio Margaritaville was solely an online channel. The channel broadcasts from the Margaritaville restaurant at [[Universal CityWalk]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].

In August 2006, he released the album \'\'[[Take The Weather With You]]\'\'. The song "Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On" on this album refers to 2005\'s [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Also on the album he pays tribute to [[Merle Haggard]] with his rendition of "Silver Wings" and covers, with [[Mark Knopfler]] playing on the track, "Whoop De Doo." On August 30, 2007, he received his star on the prestigious Mohegan Sun Walk of Fame.<ref>http://www.margaritaville.com/jimmybuffett_about.html</ref><ref>http://mohegansun.com/signature-events/mohegan-sun-s-walk-of-fame.html</ref>

On 8 December 2009, Jimmy Buffett released his 28th studio album entitled \'\'[[Buffet Hotel]]\'\'.

On 20 April 2010, a double CD of performances recorded during the 2008 and 2009 tours called \'\'[[Encores (Jimmy Buffett album)|Encores]]\'\' was released exclusively at Walmart, Walmart.com and Margaritaville.com.

Buffett partnered in a [[duet]] with the [[Zac Brown Band]] on the song "[[Knee Deep]]": released on Brown\'s 2010 album [[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]], it became a hit country and pop single in 2011. Also in 2011, Buffett voiced [[Huckleberry Finn]] on \'\'[[Mark Twain: Words & Music]]\'\', which was released on [[Mailboat Records]]. The project is a benefit for the [[Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum]] and includes [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Mark Twain]], [[Garrison Keillor]] as the narrator and songs by [[Brad Paisley]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Emmylou Harris]], and others.

Of the over 30 albums Jimmy Buffett has released, as of October 2007, 8 are Gold Albums and 9 Platinum or Multi Platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Albums database|accessdate=18 October 2007}}</ref> In 2003 Buffett won his first ever Country Music Award (CMA) for his song "It\'s 5 O\'clock Somewhere" with Alan Jackson, and was nominated again in 2007 for the CMA Event of the Year Award for his song "Hey Good Lookin" which featured Alan Jackson and George Strait.

Buffett released his latest album, Songs From St. Somewhere on August 20, 2013.

===Musical style===
Jimmy began calling his music Drunken Caribbean Rock \'n Roll as he says on his 1978 Live Album "You Had To Be There". Later, Buffett himself and others have used the term \'\'\'gulf and western\'\'\' to describe his [[music genre|musical style]] and that of other similar sounding performers.<ref>Alanna Nash.

Other performers identified as gulf and western are often deliberately derivative of Buffett\'s musical style and some are [[tribute band]]s or, in the case of [[Greg "Fingers" Taylor]], a former member of Jimmy Buffett\'s [[Coral Reefer Band]].<ref name="jim-morris1">{{cite web |url=http://www.jim-morris.com/music.htm |title=Music samples |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010303001606/http://www.jim-morris.com/music.htm |archivedate=2001-03-03 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> They can be heard on Buffett\'s [[internet|online]] Radio Margaritaville and on the compilation [[album]] series \'\'Thongs in the Key of Life\'\'.

==Writing==
Buffett has written three No.&nbsp;1 best sellers. \'\'[[Tales from Margaritaville]]\'\' and \'\'[[Where Is Joe Merchant?]]\'\'; both spent over seven months on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|\'\'The New York Times\'\' Best Seller]] fiction list. His book \'\'[[A Pirate Looks At Fifty]],\'\' published in 1998, went straight to No.&nbsp;1 on the \'\'New York Times\'\' Best Seller non-fiction list, making him one of eight authors in that list\'s history to have reached number one on both the fiction and non-fiction lists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anthony Decurtis |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/21/arts/music-jimmy-buffett-traveling-salesman-of-leisure.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; Jimmy Buffett, Traveling Salesman of Leisure - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-02-21 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> The seven other authors who have accomplished this are [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[William Styron]], [[Irving Wallace]], [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Mitch Albom]] and [[Glenn Beck]].

Buffett also co-wrote two children\'s books, \'\'[[The Jolly Mon]]\'\' and \'\'Trouble Dolls,\'\' with his eldest daughter, Savannah Jane Buffett. The original hard cover release of \'\'[[The Jolly Mon]]\'\' included a cassette tape recording of him and Savannah Jane reading the story accompanied by an original score written by [[Michael Utley]].

Buffett\'s novel \'\'[[A Salty Piece of Land]],\'\' was released on November 30, 2004, and the first edition of the book included a CD single of the song "A Salty Piece Of Land", which was recorded for \'\'[[License to Chill]]\'\'.

Buffett wrote the soundtrack for, and co-produced and played a role in, the 2006 film \'\'[[Hoot (film)|Hoot]],\'\' directed by [[Wil Shriner]] and based on the book by [[Carl Hiaasen]], which focused on issues important to Buffett, such as conservation. The film was not a critical or commercial success. Among his other film music credits are the theme song to the short-lived 1993 [[CBS]] television series \'\'[[Johnny Bago]]\'\'; "Turning Around" for the 1985 film \'\'[[Summer Rental]]\'\' starring [[John Candy]]; "I Don\'t Know (Spicoli\'s Theme)" for the film \'\'[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]\'\'; "Hello, Texas" for the 1980 [[John Travolta]] film \'\'[[Urban Cowboy]]\'\'; and "If I Have To Eat Someone (It Might As Well Be You)" for the animated film \'\'[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]\'\', which was sung in the film by rap artist [[Tone Loc]].

In addition, Buffett has made several [[cameo appearance]]s, including in \'\'[[Repo Man (1984 film)|Repo Man]]\'\', \'\'[[Hook (film)|Hook]]\'\', \'\'[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]\'\', \'\'[[Hoot (film)|Hoot]]\'\', \'\'[[Congo (film)|Congo]]\'\', and \'\'[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]\'\'. He also made cameo appearances as himself in \'\'[[Rancho Deluxe]]\'\' (for which he also wrote the music) and in \'\'[[FM (film)|FM]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0119364/ |title=Jimmy Buffett|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> He made a Guest appearance in the season two of \'\'[[Hawaii Five-0]]\'\' on \'\'[[CBS]]\'\' in 2011. Buffett reportedly was offered a cameo role in \'\'[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]\'\', but declined the offer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0325980/trivia |title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl|publisher=IMDb.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> In 1997, Buffett collaborated with novelist [[Herman Wouk]] on a musical production based on Wouk\'s 1965 novel \'\'[[Don\'t Stop the Carnival (novel)|Don\'t Stop the Carnival]]\'\'. In the \'\'[[South Park]]\'\' episode "[[Tonsil Trouble]]", an animated version of Buffett (but not voiced by Buffett) was seen singing "AIDSburger in Paradise" and "CureBurger in Paradise". Jimmy has also appeared on the Sesame Street special, [[Elmopalooza]], singing "[[Caribbean Amphibian]]" with the popular Muppet, Kermit the Frog. Buffett appeared in an episode of \'\'[[Hawaii Five-0]]\'\' in November 2011. He played a helicopter pilot named Frank Bama, a character out of his novel, "Where is Joe Merchant". Another character mentioned that he preferred "margaritas"; Buffett\'s character replied, "Can\'t argue with you there."

==Business ventures==
Buffett has taken advantage of his name and the fan following for his music to launch several business ventures, usually with a tropical theme. He owns or licenses the Margaritaville Cafe and Cheeseburger in Paradise [[restaurant chain]]s. As a baseball fan, he was part-owner of two minor league teams: the [[Fort Myers Miracle]] and the [[Madison Black Wolf]]. Between his restaurants, album sales, and tours, he earns an estimated US$100 million a year.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} He opened the Margaritaville store in Key West, Florida, in 1985.

In 1993, he launched Margaritaville Records, with distribution through MCA Records. His MCA record deal ended with the release of 1996\'s \'\'Christmas Island\'\' and he took Margaritaville Records over to Chris Blackwell\'s Island Records for a two record deal, 1998\'s \'\'Don\'t Stop The Carnival\'\' and 1999\'s \'\'Beach House On The Moon\'\'. In the fall of 1999, he started up Mailboat Records to release live albums. He entered into a partnership with RCA Records for distribution in 2005 and 2006 for the two studio albums \'\'License To Chill\'\' and \'\'Take The Weather With You\'\'.

In 2006, Buffett launched a cooperative project with the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewing company to produce beer under the Margaritaville Brewing label called [[Land Shark Lager]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/viewColaDetails.do?action=publicFormDisplay&ttbid=06300001000108 |title=OMB No. 1513-0020 |publisher=Ttbonline.gov |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

Another Margaritaville Casino opened in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] in May 2013. Buffett has also licensed Margaritaville [[Tequila]], Margaritaville Footwear and a Margaritaville Foods including Chips, Salsa, Guacamole, Shrimp, Chicken and more.

From May 8, 2009, through January 5, 2010, [[Sun Life Stadium]] (formerly Dolphin Stadium) in [[Miami]], the home of the [[Miami Dolphins]], was named Landshark Stadium pursuant to an eight-month naming rights deal.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/01/18/1432622/dolphin-stadiums-new-name-sun.html Dolphin Stadium\'s New Name] {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunlifestadium.com/content/history.aspx |title=Sun Life Stadium :: History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100211142537/http://www.sunlifestadium.com/content/history.aspx |archivedate=2010-02-11 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> Buffett also wrote new lyrics for the team to his 1979 song "[[Fins (song)|Fins]]", which is played during Dolphins home games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/dol-fans/fins-fish-song |title=Fins For The Fish Song |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091124173858/http://www.miamidolphins.com/dol-fans/fins-fish-song |archivedate=2009-11-24 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> Despite Buffett\'s partnership with the Dolphins, Buffett is a diehard [[New Orleans Saints]] fan, having attended the team\'s first game at [[Tulane Stadium]] in 1967 and later had Saints head coach [[Sean Payton]] served as an honorary member of the [[Coral Reefer Band]] at a concert in [[New Orleans]] on April 1, 2012, in protest of Payton\'s suspension by the [[National Football League|NFL]] as a result of the Saints\' [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Chase |first=Chris |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/sean-payton-played-bongos-jimmy-buffett-143846564.html |title=Sean Payton played bongos for Jimmy Buffett &#124; Shutdown Corner - Yahoo!

In May 2011, Buffett announced that he had entered into a partnership with game makers [[THQ]] to make a [[Margaritaville]] game for Facebook and [[iOS]] devices. The game opened in [[closed beta]] to what\'s being referred to as the Buffett Beta Club. The game, which requires users to download [[Unity Engine]] for use on the Facebook [[API]], is expected to release on Facebook in December 2011 and to [[iOS]] devices by the end of January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaul |first=Brandy |url=http://blog.games.com/2011/11/10/margaritaville-online-closed-beta-preview/ |title=MargaritaVille Online: Jump into a life of tropical relaxation on Facebook |publisher=Blog.games.com |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> While on stage in August 2012 at a concert in Cincinnati Buffett announced that a new Margaritaville cafe would be one of the new tenants at the Cincinnati Horseshoe casino opening in Spring 2013.

==Charity work==
Buffett has been involved in many charity efforts. In 1981 the [[Save the Manatee Club]] was founded by Buffett and former Florida governor [[Bob Graham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethemanatee.org/smchist.htm |title=Save the Manatee Club |publisher=Savethemanatee.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> Save the Manatee Club is the world\'s leading manatee protection organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20070529104417tsop.nb/topstory.html |title=Navigate with Care Manatees are There |publisher=Newsblaze.com |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> [[West Indian Manatee]] In 1989, legislation was passed in Florida that introduced the "Save the Manatee" [[license plate]], and earmarked funding for the Save the Manatee Club. One of the two manatees trained to interact with researchers at [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] is named Buffett after the singer. Buffett is also a longtime supporter of and major donor to the [http://gulfspecimen.org/Newsletters/NewsletterMarch2010/index.htm Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratories].

The "Singing for Change" foundation was initially funded by proceeds from Buffett\'s 1995 concert tour, and provides grants to local charities in three main areas: children and family causes, environmental causes, and causes for disenfranchised groups.<ref>[http://islandwaves.tamucc.edu/V18I14/jimmybuffet.htm "Singing For Change Foundation: Jimmy {{sic|Buffet}} Helps the Community"].

On November 23, 2004, Buffett raised substantial money at his "Surviving the Storm" Hurricane Relief Concert in Orlando, Florida to provide relief for hurricane victims in Florida, Alabama and the Caribbean affected by the four major hurricanes that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html |title=Jimmy Buffett: Surviving the Storm - Hurricane Benefit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071219131526/http://homepage.mac.com/paperboy/blogwavestudio/LH20040529224556/LHA20041028052602/index.html |archivedate=2007-12-19 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>

Buffett performed in Hong Kong on January 18, 2008 for a concert that raised US$63,000 for the Foreign Correspondents\' Club Charity Fund. This was his first concert in Hong Kong and it sold out within weeks. Not only did Buffett perform for the groundlings for free, but he also paid for the concertgoers\' tequila and beer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascrampton.com/2008/01/31/jimmy-buffett-hong-kong-concert-organizers-apologize-to-buffett-fans/ |title=Jimmy Buffett Hong Kong concert organizers apologize to Buffett fans |publisher=Thomas Crampton |date=2008-01-31 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

On July 11, 2010, Buffett, a Gulf Coast native, put on a free concert on the beach in [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]]. The concert was Buffett\'s response to the [[BP]] oil disaster in the Gulf. The concert was aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] television. The 35,000 free tickets were given away within minutes to help draw people back to Alabama\'s beaches. Buffett played several popular songs including "Fins", "Son of a Son of a Sailor", "A Pirate Looks at Forty" and modified versions of "Margaritaville" (where the lyrics were changed in the chorus to "now I know, it\'s all BP\'s fault") and "When the Coast is Clear" (the lyrics in the chorus also referencing the Deepwater Horizon disaster: "That\'s when it always happens / When greed and crude collide"). The concert featured [[Jesse Winchester]] and [[Allen Toussaint]].

==Controversy==
The earliest controversy with Buffett was his recording of "God\'s Own Drunk" on the album \'\'[[Living and Dying in 3/4 Time]]\'\'. In 1983 the son of the late entertainer [[Lord Buckley]] sued Buffett for $11 million for copyright infringement claiming that Buffett took parts of the monologue from Buckley\'s \'\'A Tribute to Buckley\'\' and claimed it as his own work in "God\'s Own Drunk". The suit also alleged that Buffett\'s "blasphemous" rendition presented to the public a distorted impression of Lord Buckley.<ref>"Jimmy Buffett Sued Over Song" \'\'Miami Herald\'\' 30 August 1983: 1A.</ref> A court injunction against Buffett prevented him from performing the song until the lawsuit was settled or resolved, so starting in 1983 Buffett would get to the part of his show where he would normally perform "God\'s Own Drunk," he would say that he wasn\'t allowed to play it because of the lawsuit and instead played a song he wrote called "The Lawyer and the Asshole" in which he accuses Buckley\'s son and lawyers as being greedy and tells them to "kiss his ass."

In January 1996 Buffett\'s [[Grumman HU-16]] airplane nicknamed "[[Hemisphere dancer|Hemisphere Dancer]]" was shot at by Jamaican police who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane had previously been carrying Buffett as well as [[U2]]\'s Bono, and Island Records producer Chris Blackwell, and co-pilot Bill Dindy, but they were not on board at the time. The Jamaican government acknowledged the mistake and apologized to Buffett who penned the song "Jamaica Mistaica" for his \'\'Banana Wind\'\' album based on the experience. The plane from the incident is now at Orlando City Walk\'s Margaritaville.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/widgeon-seaplane-crash/ |title=Jimmy Buffett Crashes his Grumman Widgeon Seaplane \xc2\xbb Jimmy Buffett World |publisher=Buffettworld.com |date=1994-08-25 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&dat=19940826&id=7yQgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oGoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2680,5532930 |title=Buffett Uninjured in Sea Plane Crash |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref>

On February 4, 2001, he was ejected from the [[American Airlines Arena]] in Miami during a [[Miami Heat]]/[[New York Knicks]] basketball game for cursing. After the game, referee Joe Forte said that he ordered him moved during the fourth quarter because "there was a little boy sitting next to him and a lady sitting by him. He used some words he knows he shouldn\'t have used." Forte apparently didn\'t know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach [[Pat Riley]] because he thought Riley\xe2\x80\x94who was trying to explain to him who Buffett was\xe2\x80\x94was insulting him by asking if he\'d ever been a "Parrothead", the nickname for Buffett fans.<ref name="buffettEjected">{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2001/02/05/Sports/Across.The.Wire-698290.shtml |title=Singer Buffett ejected from Knicks and Heat contest |accessdate=25 August 2007}}</ref> Buffett didn\'t comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it with [[Matt Lauer]] on \'\'[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]\'\' three days later.

On October 6, 2006, it was reported that Buffett had been detained by French custom officials in [[Saint Tropez]] for allegedly carrying over 100 pills of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite web

Buffett\xe2\x80\x99s luggage was searched after his [[Dassault Falcon 900]] private jet landed at Toulon-Hy\xc3\xa8res International Airport. He paid a fine of $300 and was released. A [[spokesperson]] for Buffett stated the pills in question were [[prescription drugs]], but declined to name the drug or the health problem for which he was being treated. Buffett released a statement that the "ecstasy" was in fact, a B-vitamin supplement known as [[Foltx]].<ref>{{cite web

==Concerts and tours==

==="The Big 8" and standard songs===
Before 2003, songs played at every Buffett show were known as the Big&nbsp;8. With the success of the [[Alan Jackson]] duet "[[It\'s 5 O\'Clock Somewhere]]", and the rising popularity of "[[One Particular Harbour]]", the list of songs played at every show went from 8 to 10. The "Big 8" were:
#"[[Margaritaville]]"
#"[[Come Monday]]"
#"[[Fins (song)|Fins]]"
#"[[Volcano (Jimmy Buffett song)|Volcano]]"
#"[[A Pirate Looks at Forty]]"
#"[[Cheeseburger in Paradise]]"
#"[[Why Don\'t We Get Drunk]]" \xe2\x80\x94 \'\'only played occasionally, as of 2007\'\'
#"[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes (song)|Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]"

Since "Why Don\'t We Get Drunk" has been knocked off the standards list, there are only nine songs played at almost every show in recent years. However, neither Buffett nor the Coral Reefers have ever used the term "Big&nbsp;9" for the new line-up.

This list does not necessarily mean that those songs have been played at every show. "A Pirate Looks at Forty" was not played during the [[George, Washington]]&nbsp;\'92 show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1992.html#11 |title=1992 - Recession Recess Tour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040417012416/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1992.html |archivedate=2004-04-17 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "Cheeseburger in Paradise" was excluded from two setlists during the 1998 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1998.html#11 |title=1998 - Don\'t Stop the Carnival Tour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040517123852/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1998.html |archivedate=2004-05-17 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "One Particular Harbour" was left out of 11 shows during the 1997 tour,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1997.html#6 |title=1997 - Havana Daydreamin\' Tour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040805181743/http://buffettworld.com/sl_1997.html |archivedate=2004-08-05 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> not to mention every show during the 1988 & 1989 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1989.html |title=1989 Off To See The Lizard Tour |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031230235134/http://www.buffettworld.com/sl_1989.html |archivedate=2003-12-30 |accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> "Why Don\'t We Get Drunk" was not played at all during the Bama Breeze tour, and has since only returned to be played on an occasional basis.

Other notable songs that are played at almost all shows, but have been dropped on occasion, are "[[Son of a Son of a Sailor (song)|Son of a Son of a Sailor]]", [[Van Morrison]]\'s "[[Brown Eyed Girl]]" and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash|Crosby, Stills and Nash\'s]] "[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]". However, it\'s not unusual for these three songs to be dropped from a show, therefore they aren\'t considered a standard.

In an interview on KLBJ radio in Austin, TX on May 2, 2013, Buffett humorously referred to the fact that they have to \'play the ten that everyone wants, or else we\'ll get killed", and then went on to play "It\'s Five O\'Clock Somewhere" on air. The set list for the event on May 3 at the Austin 360 Amphitheater, his first outdoor show in Austin in 17 years, did include the \'ten\'. The show was one of the very few in Buffett\'s career that had ever been rescheduled on account of weather conditions (extreme wind in Austin forced the move to May 3 from the original date of May 2).

===Tour accident===
On January 26, 2011 ([[Australia Day]]), Buffett was performing a concert in Australia at Sydney\'s [[Hordern Pavilion]] and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, "He just went over to the edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn\'t have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped."<ref name="Fulde"/><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122985.htm Jimmy Buffett doing well after stage fall], 27 January 2011, [[ABC News Online]].

Fulde said, "I thought he\'d broken his neck." "I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now." "But at first I thought \xe2\x80\x93 this guy is going to be a spinal injury."<ref name="Fulde">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/01/27/3122659.htm Singer Jimmy Buffett falls off stage in Sydney], 27 January 2011, [[ABC News Online]]. Retrieved 27 January 2011.</ref> Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent\'s Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-01-27/dr-fulde-tells-702-breakfast-about-treating-jimmy/1919652 |title=Dr Fulde tells 702 Breakfast about treating Jimmy Buffet - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of "Margaritaville" in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience\'s delight.

==Early life==
Church was born on May 3, 1977 in [[Granite Falls, North Carolina]]. At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a [[gig (music)|gig]] at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many [[Jimmy Buffett]] cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.<ref name="proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu">{{cite web | url = http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mah&AN=MAH0001798342&site=ehost-live | title = Eric Church: Recession-era country star (interview; CD: \'Carolina\'). | accessdate = 2010-05-18}}</ref>  The band "Mountain Boys" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Eric graduated from [[South Caldwell High School]] and then [[Appalachian State University]] with a degree in business. Upon graduation, Church became engaged with a Spanish teacher in Lenoir County. The future bride\'s father attempted to persuade Eric into a corporate career, which he rejected as an aspiring musician. She broke the engagement and he headed to Nashville with his father\'s financial backing. His father also provided the opportunity to make contacts, and more importantly, time to focus on developing his songwriting ability .<ref name="proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu"/>

==Music career==

===2006\xe2\x80\x932007: \'\'Sinners Like Me\'\'===
Church co-wrote [[Terri Clark]]\'s 2005 single "The World Needs a Drink",<ref name="allmusic"/> and the track "Whiskey Wings" on [[Dean Miller]]\'s 2005 album \'\'[[Platinum (Dean Miller album)|Platinum]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/platinum-mw0000208385|title=\'\'Platinum\'\' review|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

He started recording with different producers. Capitol Nashville showed an interest and watched him perform but they were yet to be convinced enough to offer a recording contract.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AutumnH.html |title=Interview with Autumn House-Tallant |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=3 Oct 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref> Autumn House-Tallant told [[HitQuarters]] that they didn\'t think the music was interesting enough.<ref name="hitquarters"/> The record company\'s attitude changed after he started working with producer [[Jay Joyce]]. Doyle states, \xe2\x80\x9cEric scored a meeting with Nashville heavyweight Arthur Buenahora, a publisher at Sony Music who also signed Taylor Swift and Miranda Lambert. Church played him "Lightning," a ballad he wrote after watching the movie The Green Mile\xe2\x80\x9d. (p.&nbsp;5) The strong sound and direction the two forged together finally convinced Capitol Nashville that he was ready.<ref name="hitquarters"/> His first single, "[[How \'Bout You]]" peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Hot Country Songs]] and led off his debut album \'\'[[Sinners Like Me]]\'\'. In April 2006, he performed on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first time.<ref name="cmtsinners">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1537741/eric-church-turns-heads-with-sinners-like-me.jhtml|title=Church Turns Heads With \'\'Sinners Like Me\'\'|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=2006-08-02|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|accessdate=5 December 2009}}</ref>

The album\'s other two singles, "[[Two Pink Lines]]" and "[[Guys Like Me]]", both reached the Top 20 as well.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p816669/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Eric Church biography|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}</ref> The fourth single, the title track, peaked at No.&nbsp;51. An additional track from the album, "Lightning", was made into a [[music video]] despite not being released as a single. Church wrote the song shortly after moving to Nashville, inspired by the movie \'\'[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]\'\'.<ref name="cmtsinners"/> Following the album\'s success, Church toured with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Rascal Flatts]].<ref name="cmtsinners"/>

===2008\xe2\x80\x932010: \'\'Carolina\'\'===
In 2008, Eric Church released a fifth single, "His Kind of Money (My Kind of Love)" to country radio. It debuted on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart at No.&nbsp;55 in early 2008, and reached its peak of No.&nbsp;46 in August. Originally slated as the lead single to an upcoming second album, "His Kind of Money" was instead included as a bonus track on albums sold at Best Buy.

Following this song was "[[Love Your Love the Most]]", which debuted in early 2009 and was the first single from his second album \'\'[[Carolina (Eric Church album)|Carolina]]\'\', released in stores on March 24, 2009.<ref name="allmusic"/> The night before the official release, Church and Capitol Records distributed copies of the album on the campus of Church\'s alma mater, Appalachian State University, during a "release party" concert.<ref name="goblueridge.net">{{cite web | url = http://www.goblueridge.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5967&catid=1&Itemid=155 | title = Eric Church to Hold Album Release Party in Boone. | accessdate = 2012-09-19}}</ref> As with his debut album, \'\'Carolina\'\' was produced by Jay Joyce, and is entirely composed of songs that he co-wrote. "Love Your Love the Most" brought Church to the top 10 for the very first time, peaking at No.&nbsp;10 in September 2009. The album\'s second single, "[[Hell on the Heart]]", debuted in October 2009 and would also hit the top 10 in May 2010. The third single from "Carolina" was "[[Smoke a Little Smoke]]".

In June 2010 he moved to Capitol Nashville\'s new imprint EMI Records Nashville, becoming their second artist. On January 14, 2011, he released a four song EP entitled \'\'Caldwell County\'\'.

==Personal life==
On January 8, 2008, Church married music publisher Katherine Blasingame in [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]]. On October 3, 2011, they welcomed their first son, Boone McCoy Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2011/10/06/eric-church-welcomes-son-boone-mccoy/ |title=Eric Church Welcomes Son Boone McCoy \xe2\x80\x93 Moms & Babies \xe2\x80\x93 Celebrity Babies and Kids - Moms & Babies - People.com |publisher=Celebritybabies.people.com |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.theboot.com/2011/03/24/eric-church-wife-baby/ |title=Eric Church Baby News Brings \xe2\x80\x98Two Pink Lines\xe2\x80\x99 Full Circle |publisher=Theboot.com |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref> and on February 15, 2015, their second son, Tennessee Hawkins "Hawk" Church was born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/music/159992_eric_church_welcomes_second_son_tennessee_hawkins |title=Eric Church Welcomes Second Son Tennessee Hawkins - etonline.com |publisher=etonline.com |date=2015-02-19 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Their home (along with Eric\'s "[[man cave]]"), located in Nashville, was featured in an episode of [[Country Music Television|CMT]]\'s \'\'Cribs\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1579702/eric-church-marries-in-north-carolina.jhtml|title=Eric Church Marries in North Carolina|date=January 15, 2008|accessdate= February 27, 2010|publisher=CMT News}}</ref>

Church wears his signature aviator sunglasses as a result of wearing contact lenses. When his career was getting started, he was forced to deal with the heat from the stage lights drying out his contacts. As he began performing in larger venues, his aviators and [[Von Dutch]] denim trucker hat became his signature trademark.

Church has become an avid advocate for the use of marijuana, reflected in songs such as "[[Smoke a Little Smoke]]"; at the time of that song\'s release, Church\'s record label urged him not to release the song, though it became a minor success as a single.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Church / |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105031439/http://ericchurch.com/forum/eric-church-blazes-his-own-path |title=Eric Church blazes his own path |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref>

\'\'\'The Desert Rose Band\'\'\' is a US [[country rock]] band from [[California]] founded by [[Chris Hillman]] (formerly of the [[Byrds]] and the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]]) along with [[Herb Pedersen]] and [[John Jorgenson]] in 1985. Rounding out the original lineup were Bill Bryson on [[bass guitar]], Jay Dee Maness on [[pedal steel guitar]], and Steve Duncan on [[Drum kit|drums]]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band charted several hit singles on the US \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts until disbanding in February 1994.

==Formation==
The Desert Rose Band was formed in 1985 by frontman [[Chris Hillman]], formerly a member of [[The Byrds]], and co-founder, along with the late [[Gram Parsons]] of the country-rock band [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]. Additional members included John Jorgenson, who was mainly responsible for the instrumental arrangements of the songs; Herb Pedersen for the vocal arrangements. Herb sang the high tenor part above Chris\' tenor and each Desert Rose Band album featured Herb on one lead vocal. Drummer Steve Duncan and bassist Bill Bryson provided background vocals. Pedal steel player Jay Dee Maness rounded out the group.

==Career==
===1987-1988: \'\'The Desert Rose Band\'\'===
Their [[The Desert Rose Band (album)|eponymous]] debut album was issued in 1987 on [[MCA Records|MCA]]/[[Curb Records|Curb]]. It contained their first hit "Ashes of Love" which was a [[Johnnie & Jack]] song from the early 1950s. It was the second time Hillman and Pederson recorded "Ashes of Love," the first being on Hillman\'s just prior album \'\'Desert Rose\'\' on the Sugar Hill label. The Desert Rose Band\'s debut also featured a remake of Chris Hillman\'s "Time Between" which he previously recorded as a member of the Byrds, as well as the band\'s first chart-topper "[[He\'s Back and I\'m Blue]]".

===1988-1989: \'\'Running\'\'===
Their second album \'\'[[Running (The Desert Rose Band album)|Running]]\'\' (1988) featured the [[John Hiatt]]-penned hit "[[She Don\'t Love Nobody]]", "Running", and a remake of Buck Owens\'s "Hello Trouble".

===1989-1990: \'\'Pages of Life\'\' and Jay Dee Maness departure===
The third album \'\'[[Pages of Life]]\'\' featured a remake of "Desert Rose" as well as a remake of Pedersen\'s folk song about his daughter "Our Baby\'s Gone" which was originally recorded on his 1976 album \'\'Southwest\'\'. Jay Dee Maness left the band in 1990 and was replaced on pedal steel guitar by [[Tom Brumley]] whom Jay Dee replaced in the Buckaroos. Jay Dee Maness would again play with Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen on their post Desert Rose Band duo albums \'\'Bakersfield Bound\'\' and \'\'Way Out West\'\'.

===1991-1993: \'\'True Love\'\' and \'\'Life Goes On\'\'\'===
The fourth album, \'\'[[True Love (The Desert Rose Band album)|True Love]]\'\', was released in 1991. It was followed by 1993\'s  \'\'[[Life Goes On (The Desert Rose Band album)|Life Goes On]]\'\', released only in Europe. Several prominent country and bluegrass musicians made guest appearances on \'\'Life Goes On\'\' including [[Sam Bush]] on fiddle, [[Tony Rice]] and Larry Park (of [[Boy Howdy]]) on guitar, and Al Perkins on dobro. Before the release of this final studio album, was the 1993 compilation \'\'[[Traditional (album)|Traditional]]\'\'.

==Post-Desert Rose Band==
John Jorgenson and Steve Duncan left the band in 1991. Jorgenson would go on to form the Hellecasters with Will Ray and Jerry Donahue; Duncan would join the Hellecasters as well. John Jorgenson is currently playing gypsy jazz with his John Jorgenson Quintette. Chris and Herb recorded an acoustic album called \'\'The Other Side\'\' in 2005. They continue to tour as an acoustic duo. Former [[Buck Owens]] steel player Tom Brumley played with Joey Riley\'s band in [[Branson, Missouri]]. He died on 3 February 2009.

==2008-Present reunion==
Chris Hillman, Herb Pederson, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008, at the Belly Up in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were, as a duo, joined by John Jorgenson on 2 May 2008 for a small DRB set. The full lineup is the best known and included all of the original members present on the hit albums and singles from the 1980s. At this show in Nashville, Hillman stated that it was the first time that they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits, but were unable to play "He\'s Back & I\'m Blue" because Hillman had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at clubs and music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of the reunion shows were to be recorded for inclusion on an upcoming live album. This would be the only official live album released by the Desert Rose Band. However, the project was later delayed and pushed back until further notice.

As a result of their reunion, the Desert Rose Band continue to perform live dates around the world.

==Takamine 50th Anniversary==
In January 2012, the Desert Rose Band performed at the 50th Anniversary celebration for [[Takamine Guitars|Takamine]] guitars. Jorgensen, Hillman and Pedersen each played Takamine guitars. The concert was professionally filmed and can be seen on the official Takamine YouTube channel.

The \'\'\'Eagles\'\'\' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1971 by [[Glenn Frey]], [[Don Henley]], [[Bernie Leadon]], and [[Randy Meisner]]. With five number-one singles, six [[Grammy Award]]s, five [[American Music Award]]s, and six number one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, \'\'[[Their Greatest Hits (1971\xe2\x80\x931975)]]\'\' and \'\'[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]\'\', were ranked among the 20 [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in the United States]] according to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. \'\'Hotel California\'\' is ranked 37th in \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\'{{\'}}s list of "[[Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]" and the band was ranked number 75 on the magazine\'s 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite journal|title= 100 Greatest Artists \xe2\x80\x93 75 > Eagles |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |issue= 946 |publisher= [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Publishing]] |date= April 15, 2004 |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/eagles-20111216 |accessdate= October 27, 2007}}</ref>

The Eagles are one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling bands of all time]], having sold more than 150 million records<ref>{{cite news|first= Jim |last= Vorel |url= http://herald-review.com/entertainment/local/eagles-tribute-band-landing-at-kirkland/article_a8dcd506-08d0-11e2-82ac-001a4bcf887a.html |title= Eagles tribute band landing at Kirkland |date= September 27, 2012 |newspaper= [[Herald & Review]] |accessdate= January 18, 2013}}</ref>\xe2\x80\x94100 million in the U.S. alone\xe2\x80\x94including 42 million copies of \'\'Their Greatest Hits (1971\xe2\x80\x931975)\'\' and 32 million copies of \'\'Hotel California\'\'. "Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)" was the best selling album of the 20th century in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal|first= Jenny |last= Liscu |title= The Eagles: Twenty-Six Million Served |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= January 20, 2000}}</ref> They are the fifth-highest-selling music act and highest-selling American band in U.S. history. No American band sold more records than the Eagles during the 1970s.

The Eagles released their [[Eagles (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1972, which spawned three [[top 40]] singles: "[[Take It Easy]]", "[[Witchy Woman]]", and "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]". Their next album, \'\'[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]\'\' (1973), was less successful than the first, only reaching number 41 on the charts; neither of its singles reached the top 40. However, the album contained two of the band\'s most popular tracks: "[[Desperado (song)|Desperado]]" and "[[Tequila Sunrise (song)|Tequila Sunrise]]". They released \'\'[[On the Border]]\'\' in 1974, adding guitarist [[Don Felder]] midway through the recording of the album. The album generated two top 40 singles: "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]" and their first number one, "[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]".

It was not until 1975\'s \'\'[[One of These Nights]]\'\' that the Eagles became arguably America\'s biggest band. The album included three top 10 singles: "[[One of These Nights (song)|One of These Nights]]", "[[Lyin\' Eyes]]", and "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]", the first hitting the top of the charts. They continued that success and hit their commercial peak in late 1976 with the release of \'\'[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]\'\', which would go on to sell more than 16 million copies in the U.S. alone and more than 32 million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles, "[[New Kid in Town]]" and "[[Hotel California]]". They released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with \'\'[[The Long Run (Eagles album)|The Long Run]]\'\', which spawned three top 10 singles: "[[Heartache Tonight]]", "[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]", and "[[I Can\'t Tell You Why]]", the lead single being another chart-topping hit.

The Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album \'\'[[Hell Freezes Over]]\'\', a mix of live and new studio tracks. They have toured intermittently since then and were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998. In 2007, the Eagles released \'\'[[Long Road Out of Eden]]\'\', their first full studio album in 28 years and their sixth number one album. The next year they launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]] in support of the album. In 2013, they began the extended [[History of the Eagles \xe2\x80\x93 Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]] in conjunction with the band\'s documentary release, \'\'[[History of the Eagles]]\'\'.

===Formation and early releases: 1971\xe2\x80\x9373===
The Eagles began in early 1971, when [[Linda Ronstadt]] and then-manager [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] recruited session musicians [[Glenn Frey]] and [[Don Henley]].<ref name="Eagles">{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eagles-mn0000144847/biography |first= William |last= Ruhlmann |title= Eagles \xe2\x80\x93 Artist Biography |publisher= AllMusic.

The original Eagles played live together only once, backing Ronstadt for a July concert at [[Disneyland]],<ref name="Eagles"/> but all four appeared on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|eponymous album]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000628307/credits |title= Linda Ronstadt \xe2\x80\x93 Linda Ronstadt |publisher= AllMusic. All Media Network |accessdate= November 28, 2010}}</ref> After the gig with Ronstadt, Henley and Frey asked Leadon and Meisner to form a band and they soon signed with [[Asylum Records]], the new label started by [[David Geffen]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=81\xe2\x80\x9382}} The name of the band was first suggested by Leadon during a [[peyote]] and [[tequila]]-influenced group outing in the [[Mojave Desert]], when he recalled reading about the [[Hopi]]s\' reverence for the eagle.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=82}} [[Steve Martin]], a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour, recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as "the Eagles", but Frey insists that the group\'s name is simply "Eagles".{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=136}} Geffen and partner [[Elliot Roberts]] initially managed the band; they were later replaced by [[Irving Azoff]].

The group\'s eponymous debut album was recorded in England in February 1972 with producer [[Glyn Johns]].<ref name="Eagles"/> Released on June 26, 1972, \'\'[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]\'\' was a breakthrough success, yielding three [[Top 40]] singles. The first single and lead track, "[[Take It Easy]]", was a song written by Frey with his then-neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker [[Jackson Browne]]. Browne had written the majority of the song, up until the line "I\'m standing on a corner in [[Winslow, Arizona]]", where he got stalled. Frey added the next line ("It\'s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford") and Browne carried on to finish the song. The song reached number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and propelled the Eagles to stardom. The single was followed by the bluesy "[[Witchy Woman]]" and the soft country rock ballad "[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]", charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively. Their second album, \'\'[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]\'\', took [[American frontier|Old West]] outlaws for its theme, drawing comparisons between their lifestyles and modern rock stars. This album was the first to showcase the group\'s penchant for conceptual songwriting. It was during these recording sessions Henley and Frey first began writing together. They co-wrote eight of the album\'s eleven songs, including "[[Tequila Sunrise (song)|Tequila Sunrise]]" and "[[Desperado (song)|Desperado]]", two of the group\'s most popular songs. The bluegrass songs "Twenty-One", "[[Doolin\xe2\x80\x93Dalton]]", and the ballad "Saturday Night" showcase guitarist Bernie Leadon\'s abilities on the banjo, guitar, and mandolin. The story of the notorious Wild West "[[Dalton Gang|Doolin\xe2\x80\x93Dalton]]" gang is the main thematic focus of the album, as seen in the songs "Doolin\xe2\x80\x93Dalton", "Desperado", "Certain Kind of Fool", [[Outlaw Man]]", and "Bitter Creek". The album was less successful than the group\'s first, reaching only number 41 on the US [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] and yielding two singles, "Tequila Sunrise", which reached number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and "Outlaw Man", which peaked at number 59. With Henley and Frey co-writing the bulk of the album\xe2\x80\x94a pattern that would continue for years to come\xe2\x80\x94the album marked a significant change for the band. The pair also began to dominate in terms of leadership; the early assumption had been that Leadon and Meisner as veteran musicians would have a greater influence on the band.<ref>Hilburn, Robert (May 23, 1982). {{Wayback|url= http://www.eaglesfans.com/info/articles/the_long_run_is_over.html |title= The Eagles \xe2\x80\x93 A Long Run Is Over |date= 20070329072446}}. \'\'[[Los Angeles Times]].\'\' Retrieved November 18, 2012.</ref>

===\'\'On the Border\'\' and \'\'One of These Nights\'\': 1974\xe2\x80\x9375===
For their next album, \'\'[[On the Border]]\'\', Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the [[country rock]] style and move more towards [[hard rock]]. The Eagles initially started with [[Glyn Johns]] as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two songs, the band turned to [[Bill Szymczyk]] to produce the rest of the album.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=106}} Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band remembered [[Bernie Leadon]]\'s childhood friend [[Don Felder]], a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for [[Yes (band)|Yes]] in Boston.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=83\xe2\x80\x9385}}{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=94\xe2\x80\x9396}} Felder had been nicknamed "Fingers" at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=83}} In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add [[slide guitar]] to the song "Good Day in Hell" and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=108}}{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=112\xe2\x80\x93113}} He appeared on one other song on the album, the uptempo breakup song "[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]", on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. \'\'On the Border\'\' yielded a number 1 \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' single ("[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]"), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles\' first of five chart toppers. Showcasing the harder edge of the band\'s new sound with the addition of Felder, "Already Gone" was also successful, reaching number 32 on the charts. The album included a cover version of the [[Tom Waits]] song "[[Ol\' \'55]]" and the single "[[James Dean (song)|James Dean]]", which reached number 77 on the charts.

The band played at the [[California Jam]] festival in [[Ontario, California]] on April 6, 1974. Attracting more than 300,000 fans and billed as "the Woodstock of the West Coast", the festival featured [[Black Sabbath]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Seals and Crofts|Seals & Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], and [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]].{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=125}} Portions of the show were telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television in the United States, exposing the Eagles to a wider audience. Felder missed the show when he was called away to attend the birth of his son; Jackson Browne filled in for him on piano and acoustic guitar.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|pp=126\xe2\x80\x93127}}

The Eagles released their fourth studio album, \'\'[[One of These Nights]]\'\', on June 10, 1975. A breakthrough album for the Eagles, making them international superstars, it was the first in a string of four consecutive number 1 albums. The dominant songwriting partnership of Henley and Frey continued on this album. The first single was the title track, which became their second consecutive chart topper. Frey has said it is his all-time favorite Eagles tune.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The second single was "[[Lyin\' Eyes]]", which reached number 2 on the charts and won the band their first Grammy for "Best Pop Performance by a duo or group with vocal". The final single was "[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]", written by Meisner, Henley, and Frey and featuring Meisner on lead vocals. The song reached number 4 on the charts and was the Eagles\' first single to be [[Music recording sales certification|certified gold]]. The band launched a huge worldwide tour in support of the album. "One of These Nights" was nominated for a Grammy award for Album of the Year. It was their last album to feature founding member Bernie Leadon, who left the group in December of that year.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} Leadon was disillusioned with the direction the band\'s music was taking, as their sound was moving from his preferred country to rock and roll.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=133}} Leadon penned two songs for the album, including "I Wish You Peace", written with girlfriend [[Patti Davis]] (daughter of [[Governor of California|California governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]). The instrumental "Journey of the Sorcerer" would later be used as the theme music for the [[BBC]]\'s radio and television versions of \'\'[[The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy]]\'\'.

Leadon\'s replacement, officially announced on December 20, 1975, was guitarist, singer, and keyboardist [[Joe Walsh]], who had been a friend of the band for years. He had previously performed with the [[James Gang]], [[Barnstorm (band)|Barnstorm]], and as a solo artist; he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} There was some initial concern as to Walsh\'s ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered too "wild" for the Eagles, especially by Henley.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=153}} After the departure of Leadon, the Eagles\' early country sound almost completely disappeared, with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh.

In early 1976, the band released their first compilation album, \'\'Their Greatest Hits 1971\xe2\x80\x931975\'\'. The album became the highest-selling album in U.S. history, with more than 29 million copies sold in the U.S. alone and more than 42 million copies worldwide.<!--This appears to be out of date, as \'\'Thriller\'\' has sold some 65-110 million copies. http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1616537/thriller-set-overtake-eagles-top-selling-lp.jhtml--> The album cemented the group\'s status as the most successful American band of the decade.

===Major success with \'\'Hotel California\'\': 1976\xe2\x80\x9378===
Released on December 8, 1976, \'\'[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]\'\' was the band\'s fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process which, along with touring, drained the band. The album\'s first single, "[[New Kid in Town]]", became the Eagles\' third number 1 single.

The second single was the [[Hotel California|title track]], which topped the charts in May 1977 and became the Eagles\' signature song. It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh. The song was written by Felder, Henley, and Frey, with Felder writing all the music. The mysterious lyrics have been interpreted in many ways, some of them controversial. Rumors even started in certain quarters that the song was about Satanism.  The rumor was dismissed by the band and later by Henley in the documentary film \'\'[[History of the Eagles]]\'\'. Henley told \'\'[[60 Minutes]]\'\' in 2007 that "it\'s basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American Dream and about excess in America, which was something we knew about."<ref>{{cite web|first= Steve |last= Kroft |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3538308n |title= Eagles: Dark Days |date= November 25, 2007 |work= [[60 Minutes]] |publisher= [[CBS News]] |accessdate= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

With its hard rock sound, "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]" was also a major success that established Walsh\'s position in the band. The third and final single from \'\'Hotel California\'\', it reached number 11 on the charts. The ballad "Wasted Time" closes the first side of the album, while an instrumental reprise of it opens the second side. The album concludes with \'"[[The Last Resort (Eagles song)|The Last Resort]]", a song that Frey once referred to as "Henley\'s opus", but which Henley described as "fairly pedestrian" and "never fully realized, musically speaking".<ref>{{cite web|first= Cameron |last= Crowe |url= http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/the-very-best-of-the-eagles/ |title= Eagles: Very Best Of |date= August 2003 |work= Conversations with Glenn Frey and Don Henley |publisher= The Uncool |accessdate= September 22, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Gramaphone record#Structure|run-out groove]] on side two has the words "V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live" etched into the vinyl, which means that the instrumental track for the song "Victim of Love" was recorded live in the studio, with no overdubs. Henley confirms this in the liner notes of \'\'[[The Very Best Of (Eagles album)|The Very Best Of]].\'\' However, the song was a point of contention between [[Don Felder]] and the rest of the band. In the 2013 documentary, Felder claimed that he had been promised the lead vocal on "Victim of Love," for which he had written most of the music. After many unproductive attempts to record Felder\'s vocal, band manager [[Irving Azoff]] was delegated to take Felder out for a meal, removing him from the mix while Don Henley overdubbed his lead vocal.  Joe Walsh said that Felder never forgave them for the snub.  \'\'Hotel California\'\' has appeared on several lists of the best albums of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-eagles-hotel-california-20120524 |title= Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time No. 37 \xe2\x80\x93 Hotel California |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= [[Jann Wenner]] |accessdate= August 14, 2014}}</ref> and is the band\'s best-selling studio album, with more than 16 million copies sold in the U.S. alone and more than 32 million copies worldwide.

The album won Grammys for "Record of the year" ("Hotel California") and "Best arrangement for voices" ("New Kid in Town"). \'\'Hotel California\'\' topped the charts and was nominated for Album of the Year at the [[20th Annual Grammy Awards|1978 Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Fleetwood Mac]]\'s \'\'[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]].\'\' The huge worldwide tour in support of the album further drained the band members and strained their personal and creative relationships.

\'\'Hotel California\'\' is the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. The Eagles had been touring continuously for eleven months and Meisner was suffering from [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]] and the [[Influenza|flu]] by the time they arrived in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] in July.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=185}} Frey and Meisner had been continually arguing about Meisner\'s unwillingness to perform his signature song, "Take It To the Limit," during the tour, as Meisner was struggling to hit the crucial high notes in the song due to his ailments.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=185-186}} During the following show, Meisner decided to skip the song due to his flu, but when Frey aggressively demanded that he sing it as an encore the two got into a physical confrontation backstage and Meisner left the venue.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=187}} Despite pleas from Felder and Walsh, Meisner decided to leave the group after the final date of the tour and returned to Nebraska to be with his family. His last performance was in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]] on September 3, 1977.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=188}} The band replaced Meisner with the same musician who had succeeded him in [[Poco]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]], after agreeing that Schmit was the only candidate.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=190}}

In 1977, the group, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for [[Randy Newman]]\'s album \'\'[[Little Criminals]]\'\', including "[[Short People]]", which has backup vocals by Frey and Schmit.

===\'\'The Long Run\'\' and breakup: 1979\xe2\x80\x9380===
The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1977 to begin work on their next album, \'\'[[The Long Run (Eagles album)|The Long Run]]\'\'. The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. \'\'The Long Run\'\' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to \'\'Hotel California\'\', it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. "[[Heartache Tonight]]" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and "[[I Can\'t Tell You Why]]" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for "Heartache Tonight". "[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In The City]]" by Walsh and "The Sad Cafe" became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, "Funky New Year" and "Please Come Home For Christmas", which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.

Frey, Henley and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of "[[Look What You\'ve Done to Me]]" by [[Boz Scaggs]]. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the \'\'[[Urban Cowboy]]\'\' soundtrack, along with the Eagles\' 1975 hit "Lyin\' Eyes".

On July 31, 1980, in [[Long Beach, California]], tempers boiled over into what has been described as the "Long Night at Wrong Beach".<ref name="Times">{{Wayback|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2638985.ece |title= How The Eagles took it to the limits |date= 20080718172259}}. \'\'[[The Times]]\'\' (London).

"Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal", Frey recalls Felder telling him near the end of the band\'s set.<ref>{{cite news|first= Andrew |last= Gumbel |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/eagles-reform-checking-back-into-the-hotel-california-434806.html |title= Eagles reform: checking back into the Hotel California |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= February 3, 2007 |accessdate= November 27, 2010}}</ref> Felder recalls Frey telling him during "Best of My Love", "I\'m gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage."<ref name="Times"/>{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=210}}

It appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with [[Elektra Records]] to make a live record from the tour. \'\'[[Eagles Live]]\'\' (released in November 1980) was mixed on opposite coasts. Frey had already quit the band and would remain in Los Angeles, while the other band members each worked on their parts in Miami.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} "We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express", said producer [[Bill Szymczyk]].{{sfn|Eliot|2004|p=39}} Frey refused to speak to the other Eagles, and he fired Irving Azoff as his manager.{{sfn|Felder|Holden|2008|p=214}} With credits that listed no fewer than five attorneys, the album\'s liner notes simply said, "Thank you and goodnight." A single released from the album \xe2\x80\x93 "[[Seven Bridges Road]]" \xe2\x80\x93 had been a live concert staple for the band. It was written by [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]] in an arrangement created by [[Iain Matthews]] for his \'\'[[Valley Hi (album)|Valley Hi]]\'\' album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles\' last Top 40 single until 1994.

==Post breakup==
After the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band\'s long-time record label, owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles (though several of them moved to different labels in ensuing years). Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, before and during his time with the Eagles, but it was uncharted waters for the others. Walsh released a successful album in 1981, \'\'[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]],\'\' but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s, such as \'\'[[Got Any Gum?]]\'\' were less well received. During this period Walsh performed as a session musician for [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[John Entwistle]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], among others, and produced and co-wrote [[Ringo Starr]]\'s \'\'[[Old Wave]]\'\' album.

Henley achieved arguably the greatest commercial solo success of any former Eagle. In 1981, he sang a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] fame, "[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]." In 1982, he released \'\'[[I Can\'t Stand Still]],\'\' featuring the hit "[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]." This album would pale in comparison to his next release, \'\'[[Building the Perfect Beast]]\'\' (1984), which features the classic rock radio staples "[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]" (a \'\'Billboard\'\' number 5 hit), "[[All She Wants to Do Is Dance]] (number 9)," "Not Enough Love in the World" (number 34) and "[[Sunset Grill (song)|Sunset Grill]]" (number 22). Henley\'s next album, \'\'[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]\'\' (1989), was also a major success. It includes "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]," "[[The Last Worthless Evening]]" and "[[The Heart of the Matter (song)|The Heart of the Matter]]." His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.

Frey also achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, \'\'[[No Fun Aloud]],\'\' which spawned the number 15 hit, "[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]." \'\'[[The Allnighter (album)|The Allnighter]]\'\' (1984) featured the number 20 hit "Sexy Girl." He reached number 2 on the charts with "[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]" from the \'\'[[Beverly Hills Cop]]\'\' soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with "[[You Belong to the City]]" from the \'\'[[Miami Vice]]\'\' soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, "[[Smuggler\'s Blues]]." He appeared as "Jimmy" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode\'s soundtrack. He also contributed the songs "Flip City" to the \'\'[[Ghostbusters II]]\'\' soundtrack and "Part of Me, Part of You" to the soundtrack for \'\'[[Thelma & Louise]].\'\'

Former music writer turned filmmaker [[Cameron Crowe]], an Eagles fan, had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982 his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie \'\'[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].\'\' The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film\'s soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song \'\'[[Life in the Fast Lane]].\'\'

Felder also released a solo album and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie \'\'[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]\'\': "Heavy Metal (Takin\' a Ride)" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and "All of You." He also had a minor hit called "Bad Girls" off his solo album \'\'[[Airborne (Don Felder album)|Airborne]].\'\'

Schmit had a prolific solo career after the band\'s initial breakup. He had a hit song on the \'\'Fast Times at Ridgemont High\'\' soundtrack with "[[So Much in Love]]." He contributed vocals to the [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] album \'\'[[Daylight Again]]\'\' on the songs "[[Crux|Southern Cross]]" and "[[Wasted on the Way]]" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to [[David Crosby]]\'s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on [[Toto (band)|Toto]]\'s \'\'[[Toto IV]]\'\' album, including the song "[[I Won\'t Hold You Back]]" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983\xe2\x80\x931985) as a member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]\'s Coral Reefer band and coined the term "Parrotheads" for Buffett\'s die-hard fans. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with "Boys\' Night Out" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with "Don\'t Give Up," both from his album \'\'Timothy B.\'\' Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on [[Richard Marx]]\'s debut single "[[Don\'t Mean Nothing]]." In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr\'s [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] and appeared on the live video from the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Schmit released two solo albums, \'\'Playin\' It Cool\'\' in 1984 and \'\'Tell Me the Truth\'\' in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album \'\'[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]],\'\' singing backing vocals on [[Vince Gill]]\'s cover of "I Can\'t Tell You Why."

Meisner had a number 19 hit with the song "Hearts on Fire" in 1981.

==Musical style==

==Reunion==
===\'\'Hell Freezes Over\'\': 1994\xe2\x80\x932000===
An Eagles country tribute album, titled \'\'[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]\'\', was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. [[Travis Tritt]] insisted on having the \'\'Long Run\'\'-era Eagles in his video for "Take It Easy" and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five \'\'Long Run\'\'-era members\xe2\x80\x94Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit\xe2\x80\x94supplemented by [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), [[Timothy Drury]] (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.

"For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation", announced Frey at their first live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled \'\'[[Hell Freezes Over]]\'\' (named for Henley\'s recurring statement that the group would get back together "when hell freezes over"), which debuted at number 1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' album chart. It included four new studio songs, with "[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]" and "[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey\'s serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{Wayback|url= http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm |title= The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994\xe2\x80\x9395) |date= 20071011185039}}. Retrieved October 27, 2007.</ref> In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, "Take It Easy" and "Hotel California". Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.<ref name="Fans">{{cite news|first= Lucy |last= Cockcroft |title= Eagles fans forced to pay \xc2\xa31,000 per ticket |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1565979/Eagles-fans-forced-to-pay-andpound1,000-per-ticket.html |date= October 12, 2007 |work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate= September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/Music/The-price-of-fame/2004/12/03/1101923322669.html |title= The price of fame |date= December 4, 2004 |work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate= September 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Eagles performed at the [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former band mates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc \'\'[[Selected Works: 1972\xe2\x80\x931999]]\'\' box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band\'s hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from \'\'The Long Run\'\' sessions. \'\'Selected Works\'\' sold 267,000 copies at about $60 a unit.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with [[Steuart Smith]] (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder\'s role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), [[Scott F. Crago|Scott Crago]] (drums, percussion), Bill Armstrong (Horns), Al Garth (sax, violin), Christian Mostert (sax), and Greg Smith (sax, percussion).

===Don Felder sues: 2001\xe2\x80\x9302===
On February 6, 2001, Don Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits against "Eagles, Ltd.", a California corporation; Don Henley, an individual; Glenn Frey, an individual; and "[[John Doe|Does]] 1\xe2\x80\x9350", alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, reportedly seeking $50 million in damages.<ref name="Latimes">{{cite news|first= Jeff |last= Leeds |title= Reborn Eagles Lose Peaceful, Easy Feeling |page= C\xe2\x80\x931 |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= December 8, 2002 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/08/business/fi-eagles-8 |accessdate= November 18, 2012}}</ref><ref>Attwood, Brett (February 12, 2001). {{Wayback|url= http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12033366 |title= Eagles Sued By Don Felder Over Dismissal |date= 20050620074152}}. [[Yahoo! Music]]. Retrieved November 18, 2014.</ref> Felder alleged that from the 1994 \'\'Hell Freezes Over\'\' tour onward, Henley and Frey had "... insisted that they each receive a higher percentage of the band\'s profits ...", whereas the money had previously been split in five equal portions. Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times as much of the \'\'Selected Works: 1972\xe2\x80\x931999\'\' proceeds.

On behalf of his clients, Henley and Frey, the attorney [[Daniel M. Petrocelli]] said:
<blockquote>[Henley and Frey] felt \xe2\x80\x94 creatively, chemistry-wise and performance-wise \xe2\x80\x94 that he should no longer be part of the band ... They removed him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening with rock \'n\' roll bands since day one.<ref name="Latimes"/></blockquote>

Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for [[breach of contract]], alleging that Felder had written a "tell-all" book, \'\'[[Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974\xe2\x80\x932001)]]\'\'. The initial U.S. release was canceled after publisher [[Hyperion Books]] backed out in September 2001, when an entire print run of the book had to be recalled for cuts and changes. The American edition was published by [[John Wiley & Sons]] on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a full publicity campaign surrounding its release. The book was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007.<ref>Sandall, Robert (October 28, 2007). {{Wayback|title= Hell may have frozen over, but the Eagles are still feuding |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2733019.ece |date= 20110517065227}}. \'\'[[The Sunday Times]]\'\' (London).

Also in 2003, [[Warren Zevon]], a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, \'\'[[The Wind (album)|The Wind]]\'\', with the assistance of Henley, Walsh, and Schmit.

On June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set, \'\'[[Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne]]\'\', featuring two new songs: Frey\'s "No More Cloudy Days" and Walsh\'s "One Day at a Time".

Souther]], was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at [[Yahoo! Music]]. It debuted on television on [[Country Music Television]] during the [[Top 20 Countdown]] on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including "Best of My Love," "Victim of Love," "Heartache Tonight" and "New Kid in Town."

On October 30, 2007, the Eagles released \'\'[[Long Road Out of Eden]],\'\' their first album of all-new material since 1979.

On March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of \'\'Long Road Out of Eden\'\' at [[The O2 Arena]] in London. The [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]] concluded the American portion of the tour at [[Rio Tinto Stadium]] in [[Sandy, Utah]] on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour travelled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in [[Lisbon]]. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the [[Dixie Chicks]] and [[Keith Urban]]. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the [[Hop Farm Festival]] on July 1, 2011.

Asked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to \'\'Long Road Out of Eden,\'\' Schmit replied, "My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what\'s going to happen.

\'\'\'Toby Keith Covel\'\'\' (born July 8, 1961), best known as \'\'\'Toby Keith\'\'\', is an American [[country music]] singer-songwriter, record producer, and actor. Keith released his first four studio albums\xe2\x80\x941993\'s \'\'[[Toby Keith (album)|Toby Keith]]\'\', 1994\'s \'\'[[Boomtown (Toby Keith album)|Boomtown]]\'\', 1996\'s \'\'[[Blue Moon (Toby Keith album)|Blue Moon]]\'\' and 1997\'s \'\'[[Dream Walkin\']]\'\', plus a Greatest Hits package for various divisions of [[Mercury Records]] before leaving Mercury in 1998. These albums all earned gold or higher certification, and produced several chart singles, including his debut "[[Should\'ve Been a Cowboy]]", which topped the country charts and was the most played country song of the 1990s. The song has received three million spins since its release, according to [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]].<ref>Shelburne, Craig (March 1, 2007), [http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1553672/toby-keith-jams-notches-50-million-airplays.jhtml Toby Keith Jams, Notches 50 Million Airplays], \'\'CMT.com\'\', retrieved April 9, 2010</ref>

Signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single "[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]" that year. This song, the title track to his 1999 [[How Do You Like Me Now?!|album of the same name]], was the Number One country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, \'\'[[Pull My Chain]]\'\', \'\'[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]\'\', and \'\'[[Shock\'n Y\'all]]\'\', produced three more Number Ones each, and all of the albums were certified multi-platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released \'\'[[Honkytonk University]]\'\'.

When DreamWorks closed in 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become [[Show Dog-Universal Music]] in December 2009. He has released seven studio albums through Show Dog/Show Dog-Universal: 2006\'s \'\'[[White Trash with Money]]\'\', 2007\'s \'\'[[Big Dog Daddy]]\'\', 2008\'s \'\'[[That Don\'t Make Me a Bad Guy]]\'\', 2009\'s \'\'[[American Ride (Toby Keith album)|American Ride]]\'\', 2010\'s \'\'[[Bullets in the Gun]]\'\', 2011\'s \'\'[[Clancy\'s Tavern]]\'\', 2012\'s \'\'[[Hope on the Rocks]]\'\', and 2013\'s \'\'[[Drinks After Work]]\'\', as well as the compilation \'\'[[35 Biggest Hits]]\'\' in 2008. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film \'\'[[Broken Bridges]]\'\' and co-starred with comedian [[Rodney Carrington]] in the 2008 film \'\'[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]\'\'.

In 2014, Keith released \xe2\x80\x9cDrunk Americans\xe2\x80\x9d, the first single of his upcoming album, expected to be released in early 2015.<ref>\xe2\x80\x9cBrandy Clark Opens Up About Writing Toby Keith\xe2\x80\x99s New Single\xe2\x80\x9d, Rolling Stone, retrieved on Jan. 7, 2015 from http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brandy-clark-talks-new-drunk-toby-keith-song-20141014</ref>

Overall, Keith has released seventeen studio albums, two Christmas albums, and four compilation albums. He has also charted sixty singles on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including twenty Number One hits and twenty-one additional Top Ten hits. His longest-lasting Number One hits are "[[Beer for My Horses]]" (a 2003 duet with [[Willie Nelson]]) and "[[As Good as I Once Was]]" (2005), at six weeks each. He has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide.

==Early life==
Keith was born in [[Clinton, Oklahoma]], the son of Carolyn Joan (\'\'n\xc3\xa9e\'\' Ross) and Hubert K. Covel, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/covel.html|title=Ancestry of Toby Keith|last=Reitwiesner|first=William Addams|publisher=wargs.com|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref><ref name="cmtbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/keith_toby/bio.jhtml|title=Toby Keith : Biography|work=Biography|publisher=cmt.com|accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> He has a sister and a brother. The family lived in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], for a few years when Keith was in grade school, but moved to [[Moore, Oklahoma]] (a suburb of [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]) when he was still young.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="cmtbio" /> Before the family moved to Moore, he visited his grandmother in Fort Smith during the summers. His grandmother owned Billie Garner\'s Supper Club in Fort Smith,<ref name="allmusic"/> where Keith became interested in the musicians who came there to play.<ref name="cmtbio" /> He did odd jobs around the supper club and started getting up on the bandstand to play with the band. He got his first guitar at the age of eight.<ref name="cmtbio" /> After the family moved to Moore, Keith attended Highland West Junior High and [[Moore High School (Oklahoma)|Moore High School]], where he played [[defensive end]] on the [[American football|football]] team.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Keith graduated from Moore High School and worked as a [[derrick]] hand in the oil fields. He worked his way up to become an operation manager. At the age of 20, he and his friends Scott Webb, Keith Cory, David "Yogi" Vowell and Danny Smith, with a few others, formed the Easy Money Band, which played at local bars as he continued to work in the oil industry. At times, he would have to leave in the middle of a concert if he was paged to work in the oil field.

Toby Keith played defensive end for the 1980 Oklahoma Sooners but never saw the field before dropping out to play semi-professional football in OKC.

In 1982, the oil industry in Oklahoma began a rapid decline and Keith soon found himself unemployed. He fell back on his football training and played defensive end with the semi-pro Oklahoma City Drillers while continuing to perform with his band. (The Drillers were an unofficial [[farm club]] of the [[United States Football League]]\'s [[Oklahoma Outlaws]]; Keith tried out for the Outlaws but did not make the team.) He then returned to focus once again on music. His family and friends were doubtful he would succeed, but, in 1984, Easy Money (various other band members included Mike Barnes, T.A. Brauer and David Saylors) began playing the [[honky tonk]] circuit in Oklahoma and [[Texas]].

==Musical career==
In the early 1990s, Keith went to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he hung out and [[Busking|busked]] on [[Music Row]] and at a place called Houndogs. He distributed copies of a [[demo (music)|demo]] tape the band had made to the many record companies in the city. There was no interest by any of the record labels, and Keith returned home feeling depressed. He had promised himself and God to have a recording contract by the time he was 30 years old or give up on music as a career. A flight attendant and fan of his gave a copy of Keith\'s demo tape to [[Harold Shedd]], a [[Mercury Records]] executive, while he was traveling on a flight she was working. Shedd enjoyed what he heard, went to see Keith perform live and then signed him to a recording contract with Mercury.

===1993-95: \'\'Toby Keith\'\' and \'\'Boomtown\'\'===
His debut single, "[[Should\'ve Been a Cowboy]]", went to number 1 <ref name="billboard.com">"Toby Keith Album & Song Chart History" Billboard Hot Country Songs for Toby Keith. Retrieved Jan 7, 2015 from http://www.billboard.com/artist/430048/Toby+Keith/chart?f=357</ref> on the [[Billboard (magazine)|\'\'Billboard\'\']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 1993, in addition to reaching number 93 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].<ref name="whitburn"/> This song led off his [[Toby Keith (album)|self-titled debut album]]. By the end of the decade, "Should\'ve Been a Cowboy" received more than three million [[spin (radio)|spins]] at radio, thus making it the most-played country song of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1553672/toby-keith-jams-notches-50-million-airplays.jhtml|title=Toby Keith Jams, Notches 50 Million Airplays|last=Shelburne|first=Craig|date=1 March 2007|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|accessdate=4 October 2010}}</ref> Certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, the album produced three more Top 5 hits on the country charts: "[[He Ain\'t Worth Missing]]" at number 5,<ref name="billboard.com"/> followed by "[[A Little Less Talk and a Lot More Action]]" (originally the [[B-side]] of "Should\'ve Been a Cowboy") and "[[Wish I Didn\'t Know Now]]" both at number 2.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|pages=219\xe2\x80\x93220|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote of the album, "It is given a production that\'s a bit too big, clean, glossy and cavernous for Keith\'s good \xe2\x80\x94 it fits the outsized sound of early-\'90s radio, but not his outsized talent \xe2\x80\x94 but beneath that sheen the songs are very strong." He also thought that it showed the signs of the style that Keith would develop on subsequent albums<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/toby-keith-mw0000095272|title=\'\'Toby Keith\'\' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> The album\'s success led to Keith touring with then-labelmates [[Shania Twain]] and [[John Brannen]].<ref name="waddell"/>

Keith was moved to [[Polydor Records]] Nashville and released his next album, \'\'[[Boomtown (Toby Keith album)|Boomtown]]\'\', in September 1994. Also certified platinum, this album was led off by the number 1 single "[[Who\'s That Man]]". After it, "[[Upstairs Downtown]]" and "[[You Ain\'t Much Fun]]" both made Top 10, while "[[Big Ol\' Truck]]" peaked at number 15. At the end of 1995, he released his first Christmas album, \'\'[[Christmas to Christmas]]\'\', via Mercury. The album, composed entirely of original songs, produced one chart entry in "Santa I\'m Right Here", which reached as high as number 50 based on Christmas airplay.<ref name="whitburn"/>

===1996-98: \'\'Blue Moon\'\', \'\'Dream Walkin{{\'}}\'\', and \'\'Greatest Hits Volume One\'\'===
Keith was moved to the short-lived Nashville division of [[A&M Records]] to release \'\'[[Blue Moon (Toby Keith album)|Blue Moon]]\'\' in April 1996. His third album to achieve a platinum certification, it also included three singles. The first was "[[Does That Blue Moon Ever Shine on You]]", written by Keith in 1987,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WB&s_site=timesleader&p_multi=WB&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB71C278953DD73&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Nothing shaky about Keith\'s music success|date=12 November 1996|work=The Times-Leader|pages=1C|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MT&s_site=macon&p_multi=MT&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB76D3553C1FB48&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Stages are set|date=29 March 1996|work=Macon Telegraph|pages=1D|accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> which reached number 2. Following it were "[[A Woman\'s Touch (song)|A Woman\'s Touch]]" at number 6, and his third number 1 hit, "[[Me Too (song)|Me Too]]", which peaked in March 1997.<ref name="whitburn"/> Keith also appeared on [[The Beach Boys]]\' now out-of-print 1996 album \'\'[[Stars and Stripes Vol. 1]]\'\' performing a cover of their 1963 hit "[[Be True to Your School]]" with the Beach Boys themselves providing the harmonies and backing vocals.

Following a corporate merger, Keith returned to Mercury in 1997. His fourth studio album, \'\'[[Dream Walkin\']]\'\', was also his first produced by [[James Stroud]], who would also serve as Keith\'s co-producer until 2005.<ref name="allmusic"/> It produced two consecutive number 2 hits in "[[We Were in Love]]" and a cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]\'s 1996 single "[[I\'m So Happy I Can\'t Stop Crying]]". Sting also sang duet vocals and played [[bass guitar]] on it,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA35EBA81992C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Keith, Sting duet gives tune second wind|date=1997-11-07|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|pages=P3|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> and the two also performed the song at the 1997 [[Country Music Association]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1473203/31st-annual-cma-awards-show.jhtml|title=31st Annual CMA Awards Show|last=Wix|first=Kimmy|date=1997-09-24|work=[[Country Music Television|CMT]]|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> After this song, the album\'s [[Dream Walkin\' (song)|title track]] made number 5, while "Double Wide Paradise" peaked at number 40.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Keith\'s last Mercury release was \'\'[[Greatest Hits Volume One (Toby Keith album)|Greatest Hits Volume One]]\'\' in October 1998.

In a January 2007 interview with \'\'[[Newsday]]\'\', Keith was asked whether he supported the [[Iraq War]]. He responded with "Never did," and said he favors setting a time limit on the campaign. He also said, "I don\'t apologize for being patriotic... If there is something socially incorrect about being patriotic and supporting your troops, then they can kiss my ass on that, because I\'m not going to budge on that at all. And that has nothing to do with politics. Politics is what\'s killing America."

In April 2008, Keith said that [[Barack Obama]] "looks like a great speaker and a great leader.

In October 2008, Keith told [[Country Music Television|CMT]] that he had left the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has re-registered as an independent. "My party that I\'ve been affiliated with all these years doesn\'t stand for anything that I stand for anymore," he says. "They\'ve lost any sensibility that they had, and they\'ve allowed all the kooks in. So I\'m going independent." He also told CMT that he would likely vote for the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] ticket, partially because of his admiration for [[Sarah Palin]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1596198/toby-keith-registering-as-independent-voter.jhtml |title=News : Toby Keith Registering as Independent Voter |publisher=CMT |date=2008-10-02 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref>

On March 24, 2001, Keith\xe2\x80\x99s father, H.K. Covel, was killed in a car accident. That event and the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 prompted Keith to write the song "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue", a song about his father\xe2\x80\x99s patriotism and faith in the United States. At first, Keith refused to record the song and sang it only live at his concerts for military personnel. The reaction to the song, the lyrics of which express clear [[nationalistic]] and [[militaristic]] sentiments, was strong in many quarters, even to the point that the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[James L. Jones]] told Keith it was his "duty as an American citizen" to record the song.<ref name=CBSnewsDec2003>{{cite news|accessdate=2007-06-05|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/28/60II/main580469.shtml|title=Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue: Singer Talks About His Defiantly Patriotic Songs|publisher=CBS News |date=2003-12-31}}</ref> As the lead single from the album \'\'Unleashed\'\' (2002), "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" peaked at number one over the [[Fourth of July]] weekend.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] invited Keith to sing "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue" on a 2002 Fourth of July concert it was producing, then rescinded the invitation after host [[Peter Jennings]] heard the song and vetoed it. Jennings said the song "probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t set the right tone". "I find it interesting that he\'s not from the U.S.," Keith said of Jennings, who was [[Canadian people|Canadian]]. "I bet [[Dan Rather]]\'d let me do it on his special."<ref>Mansfield, Brian (June 13, 2002), [http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2002/2002-06-13-toby-keith.htm Singer Toby Keith speaks out on ABC censorship], \'\'[[USA Today]]\'\', retrieved April 9, 2010</ref><ref>Leung, Rebecca (December 31, 2003), [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/28/60II/main580469.shtml "Courtesy Of The Red, White & Blue"], \'\'[[CBS News]]\'\', retrieved April 9, 2010</ref>

===Feud with the Dixie Chicks===
Keith had a public feud with the [[Dixie Chicks]] over the song "Courtesy of the Red, White, & Blue", in 2003 as well as over comments they made about President [[George W. Bush]] on stage during a concert in [[London]]. The lead singer of the Dixie Chicks, [[Natalie Maines]], publicly stated that Keith\'s song was "ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=3488 |title=Natalie Maines (Dixie Chick member) Bashes Toby Keith\'s Patriotic Anthem @ Top40-Charts.com - Songs & Videos from 49 Top 20 & Top 40 Music Charts from 30 Countries |publisher=Top40-charts.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref>  Keith responded by pointing out that Maines did not write her music and he does, and by displaying a backdrop at his concerts showing a doctored photo of Maines with [[Iraq]]i dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]. On May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters "FUTK" on the front at the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2958450.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Fresh Dixie Chicks row erupts | date=June 3, 2003 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> While a spokesperson for the Dixie Chicks said that the acronym stood for "\'\'\'F\'\'\'riends \'\'\'U\'\'\'nited in \'\'\'T\'\'\'ruth and \'\'\'K\'\'\'indness," many, including host [[Vince Gill]], took it to be a shot at Keith ("\'\'\'F\'\'\'uck Yo\'\'\'u\'\'\' \'\'\'T\'\'\'oby \'\'\'K\'\'\'eith").  In an October 2004 appearance on \'\'[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]\'\', Maines finally confessed that it was indeed a shot at Keith, and that she "thought that nobody would get it".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/216|title=video of Dixie Chicks appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher|publisher=Yoism.org|accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref>

In August 2003, Keith\'s representation publicly declared he was done feuding with Maines "because he\'s realized there are far more important things to concentrate on".  Keith was referring specifically to the terminal illness of a former bandmate\'s daughter, Allison Faith Webb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/tobey%20keith%20ends%20feud%20with%20natalie%20maines |title=Tobey Keith Ends Feud With Natalie Maines |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref> However, he continues to refuse to say Maines\' name, and claims that the doctored photo was intended to express his opinion that Maines\' criticism was an attempt to squelch Keith\'s [[free speech]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In April 2008, a commercial spot to promote [[Al Gore]]\'s "[[We Campaign]]", involving both Keith and the Dixie Chicks, was proposed. However, the idea was eventually abandoned due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/10/toby_keith_unplugged.html |title=Talk Talk: Toby Keith Unplugged - Post Rock |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref>

He is the father of three children\xe2\x80\x94two daughters, Shelley Covel Rowland<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/shelley.covelrowland?ref=ts ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> (born 1980, adopted by Keith in 1984) and Krystal "[[Krystal Keith]]" LaDawn Covel Sandubrae (born September 30, 1985; signed a contract with Show Dog-Universal in 2013.), and one son (Stelen Keith Covel, born 1997).

\'\'\'The Kentucky Headhunters\'\'\' is an American [[country rock]] and [[Southern rock]] band. They were founded in 1968 as \'\'\'Itchy Brother\'\'\', which consisted of brothers Richard Young ([[rhythm guitar]], vocals) and Fred Young ([[drums]]) along with Greg Martin ([[lead guitar]], vocals) and Anthony Kenney ([[bass guitar]], vocals). Itchy Brother performed together until 1982, with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976. The Young brothers and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986, adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps (lead vocals, [[harmonica]]) and Doug Phelps (bass guitar, backing vocals) to the membership.

With the release of their 1989 debut album \'\'[[Pickin\' on Nashville]]\'\' via [[Mercury Records]], the band charted four consecutive Top 40 country singles. A second album for Mercury, \'\'[[Electric Barnyard]]\'\', did not do as well commercially, and the Phelps brothers left after its release to form [[Brother Phelps]]. Kenney re-joined and Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals for 1993\'s \'\'[[Rave On!!]]\'\' and a [[compilation album]] entitled \'\'[[The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters: Still Pickin\']]\'\' before the band exited Mercury. Orr left and Doug Phelps rejoined in 1996 as lead vocalist for the album \'\'[[Stompin\' Grounds]]\'\'. He also led on the [[Audium Entertainment]] albums \'\'[[Songs from the Grass String Ranch]]\'\' and \'\'[[Soul (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Soul]]\'\', as well as \'\'[[Big Boss Man (album)|Big Boss Man]]\'\' and a second compilation, \'\'[[Flying Under the Radar]]\'\', on CBuJ Entertainment. After Kenney\'s departure, Doug once again became the band\'s bass guitarist by the release of its next album, \'\'[[Dixie Lullabies]]\'\', in 2011.

The Kentucky Headhunters have released seven studio albums, two compilations, and twenty singles, of which the highest-peaking is a cover of the [[Don Gibson]] song "[[Oh Lonesome Me]],"  which the band took to number 8 in 1990. In addition, the band has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards, an [[Academy of Country Music]] award and a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], won in 1990 for \'\'Pickin\' on Nashville\'\'.

==History==

===1968\xe2\x80\x931982: Early years as Itchy Brother===
Richard Young, his younger brother Fred, and their cousins Anthony Kenney and Greg Martin began performing music in the Youngs\' and Kenney\'s hometown of [[Glasgow, Kentucky]] in the 1960s. They founded a band called Itchy Brother,<ref name="violets">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/1258|title=Kentucky Headhunters no shrinking violets|last=Morrison|first=Tonya Parker|date=2005-07-19|work=American Chronicle|accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> named after Fred\'s favorite cartoon character,<ref name="indie"/> from \'\'[[King Leonardo and His Short Subjects]]\'\'. The band achieved regional success in Kentucky in the 1970s, including at least one single, "Shotgun Effie," which they wrote about the Youngs\' grandmother, Effie.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Mark|title=Dixie Lullaby|page=215|isbn=0-8203-2872-3|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JdMX9tbWdEMC&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=%22Shotgun+effie|date=September 2006}}</ref> It was released in 1973 on the King Fargo label. That same year, Greg Martin left the group to play in another band in his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In the meantime, guitarist James Harrison took his place. Martin returned to the group in 1976.<ref>[http://www.bgdailynews.com/amplifier/music/our-musical-memories-the-rocking-sound-of-itchy-brother-an/article_40892156-6893-5d0c-815d-c199d50301a7.html]</ref>

Itchy Brother was almost signed to [[Swan Song Records]], an independent label founded by the band [[Led Zeppelin]], in 1980. The label closed after Led Zeppelin drummer [[John Bonham]] died, and Itchy Brother never recorded a full album on Swan Song.<ref name="oldies">{{cite web | title=The Kentucky Headhunters biography | url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/The-Kentucky-Headhunters.html | work=Oldies.com | accessdate=2009-05-23 }}</ref> Itchy Brother broke up in 1982. After their disbanding, Richard started writing songs for [[Acuff-Rose Music]], and Fred became a backing musician for country singer [[Sylvia (singer)|Sylvia]], who at the time was recording on [[RCA Records]]. Martin played [[bass guitar]] and sang backing vocals for [[Ronnie McDowell]], then a recording artist for [[Curb Records]], and Kenney stopped performing, although he continued to write songs with the Young brothers.<ref name="violets"/>

===1986\xe2\x80\x931988: Reunion with new name===
When Martin attempted to reunite Itchy Brother in 1985, the Young brothers joined him, but Kenney declined. Martin invited [[Missouri Bootheel]] native Doug Phelps,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Steve|date=1991-06-17|title=Mixing Hard Rock with Country Music Puts Five Down-Home Boys on a Roll|volume=35|issue=23|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115340,00.html}}</ref> also a member of McDowell\'s band, to replace Kenney, and Doug brought his older brother Ricky Lee to sing [[lead vocals]] and play [[harmonica]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The band decided to name themselves The Headhunters, taking the name from the term "headchopper," which blues musician [[Muddy Waters]] used to indicate that he had supplanted another band in a [[gig (musical performance)|gig]].

===1989\xe2\x80\x931990: Debut album and early success===
The Kentucky Headhunters borrowed $4,500<ref name="kentucky">{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Charles|title=Kentucky Country|page=181|isbn=0-8131-0879-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3x4TUwtiCZgC&pg=RA1-PA180&dq=%22kentucky+headhunters%22#PRA1-PA181,M1|year=1996}}</ref> to record a [[demo (music)|demo]] album, which included seven original songs, plus covers of [[Bill Monroe]]\'s "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine," [[Henson Cargill]]\'s "[[Skip a Rope]]" and [[Don Gibson]]\'s "[[Oh Lonesome Me]]."<ref name="kentucky"/> Originally intended to be sold at the band\'s live shows, the demo tape came to the attention of the Nashville music community.<ref name="oldies"/> Although Martin said that the band had not seriously considered signing a record deal, the band pursued one through the suggestion of its manager, Mitchell Fox.<ref name="asker"/> [[Harold Shedd]], a record producer who was then the head of [[Mercury Records]], helped sign The Kentucky Headhunters to the label in 1989.

Mercury released the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters\' debut album, \'\'[[Pickin\' on Nashville]]\'\'. The album produced four singles, all of which reached top 40 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) chart. The first of these, the "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|page=223|isbn=0-89820-177-2|accessdate=2009-10-06}}</ref> After it came "[[Dumas Walker]]," about a then-74-year-old [[marble (toy)|marbles]] player who owned a [[liquor store]] that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: "[The label] thought it was too regional, and that no one outside the area would get it, but what they didn\'t see, was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn\'t matter where we were playing either."<ref name="doug">{{cite web|url=http://www.libertynjustice.net/gettoknow_doug.php|title=Get to know Doug Phelps|work=Liberty \'n Justice|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> The single peaked at number 15 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' chart.<ref name="whitburn"/>

Rock was a [[rapper]] and [[hip hop]] performer with five releases between 1990 and 1997, including a reissue and an [[Extended play|EP]]. After signing a [[recording contract]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1998, he gained commercial success in the [[rap-rock]] genre behind the singles "[[Bawitdaba]]", "[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]" and "[[Only God Knows Why]]" (the latter foreshadowing his move into country rock). After \'\'Devil Without a Cause\'\'{{\'}}s success in 2000, he released \'\'[[The History of Rock]],\'\' a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from previous albums as well as the hit rock single, "[[American Bad Ass]]".

The album featured the song "[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]", which charted at No. 1 in eight countries across Europe and Australia.<ref name="sales">{{cite web |title=Kid Rock Celebrates 2 Million Album Sold!|work=Vivid Seats |url=http://www.kidrock.com/news/2008/08/28/kid-rock-celebrates-2-million-album-sold/|accessdate=August 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Sales">{{cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |title=Kid Rock boycotts iTunes over pay |publisher=BBC News |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> In 2010, he released \'\'[[Born Free (Kid Rock album)|Born Free]]\'\', which featured an [[Born Free (Kid Rock song)|eponymous song]] that became the [[campaign song|political campaign theme]] of [[Mitt Romney]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]].

== Early life ==
Robert James "Bob" Ritchie was born on January 17, 1971 in [[Romeo, Michigan]] to William "Bill" Ritchie, a car dealer who owned several local dealerships, and Susan Ritchie. He attended [[Romeo High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/macomb-county/kid-rock-surprises-romeo-high-school-students-at-assembly|title=Kid Rock surprises Romeo High School students at assembly

In high school, Ritchie djayed at parties for beer. He eventually joined Bo Wisdom of Groove Time Productions in [[Mt. Clemens, Michigan]] to perform basement parties for $30 a night. He chose his stage name while performing at these venues; club goers dubbed him "Kid Rock" after they had enjoyed watching "that white kid rock."

Ritchie eventually ran away to Mt. Clemens at 15 and stayed with his friend Chris Pouncy. He was forced by a local drug gang known as the "Best Friends" to sell drugs out of a car wash at which he worked. In an attempt to keep the kids out of trouble, a man in the neighborhood organized a rap group, composed of its founder The Blackman, [[Champtown]], KDC, Chris "Doc Roun-Cee" Pouncy, and Bob. They were known as "The Beast Crew". While performing, Rock befriended producer [[D-Nice]] of the legendary hip-hop group [[Boogie Down Productions]]. When Rock opened for BDP one night, D-Nice invited an [[A&R]] representative from [[Jive Records]] to see him perform. This meeting led to a demo deal that developed into a full record contract.

Against his parents\' wishes, Rock signed the deal at age 17. Despite his record deal, he had a falling out with The Beast Crew when he signed over fellow member Champtown, though the two have since renewed their friendship.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} His vocals were left on the tracks of their debut underground album \'\'Chapter 1: He Don\'t Want Us No More\'\', against Rock\'s wishes. He later became part of the Straight From The Underground Tour alongside several major rap artists, including [[Ice Cube]], [[Too Short]], D-Nice, [[Mac Dre]], and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]].

=== 1990\xe2\x80\x931997: The hip-hop era ===
On December 30, 1990, Kid Rock released his debut album \'\'[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]\'\'. As noted by [[Insane Clown Posse]] member [[Violent J]], this album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local [[independent music|independent]] rapper [[Esham]].<ref name="BehindthePaint164">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=164\xe2\x80\x93167 |chapter=Paying Dues }}</ref><ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=174\xe2\x80\x93189 |chapter=The Dark Carnival|date=August 2003 }}</ref> Though Jive Records did not push the album, it gained infamy when radio station [[WSUC-FM]] (90.5) of [[Cortland, New York]] was fined $23,700 by the FCC \xe2\x80\x93 then the largest fine against a radio station \xe2\x80\x93 for playing the song "Yo Da-Lin In the Valley". The album sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Kid Rock\'s career had begun to decline towards the end of 1990<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> and Jive Records released Kid Rock from his contract in 1991. Once back in Detroit, he became friends with [[Uncle Kracker]] after battling his brother in a [[freestyle rapping]] competition. Afterward, Uncle Kracker became Kid Rock\'s DJ. At the time Uncle Kracker had no clue how to work the turntables.

In late 1991, Kid Rock was picked up by an independent record label called Continuum Records, which held Pink Floyd at one time. Though Insane Clown Posse\'s Violent J disliked Kid Rock\'s rapping style, he paid Kid Rock to appear on Insane Clown Posse\'s first album, \'\'[[Carnival of Carnage]]\'\' in 1992, in an attempt to get the album noticed.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> Kid Rock showed up to record the song "Is That You?" intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.<ref name="BehindthePaint174" /> In March 1993, Continuum released his second album \'\'[[The Polyfuze Method]]\'\'. Kid Rock had taught himself how to play several instruments including guitar, drums, keyboards, and organ.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As a result, the album, which sold approximately 15,000 copies, featured a more [[rap rock]]-oriented sound. The album heavily sampled psychedelic blues from Led Zeppelin (Prodigal Son, My Oedipus Complex), Pink Floyd (The Cramper) and The Doors (U Don\'t Know Me), Black Sabbath (Pancake Breakfast ) and The Smiths (Back From The Dead) amongst others.The album saw some local college radio success at [[Central Michigan University]] with the tracks "Back From The Dead" and "Balls In Your Mouth". He wanted "Prodigal Son" as the lead single, but Continuum refused and released "U Don\'t Know Me" as the first single. It failed to chart, and the music video received little airplay on major music video channels. Kid Rock re-released "Back From The Dead" as a single to mainstream radio and produced the music video himself, but it also failed as a single.

He released an [[Extended play|EP]] called \'\'[[Fire It Up (EP)|Fire It Up]]\'\' in December 1993 that featured the song "[[I Am the Bullgod]]", which would not be a hit until six years later. The vocals on this version were more raw.The singles "Prodigal Son " and " My Oedipus Complex were released, but failed to find a niche. Continuum did not see a future with Kid Rock after this, and released him from his contract in 1994. He began side work with a local Detroit rap metal group Harm\'s Way in 1994 producing, scratching and playing drums on two of their independent releases. He also produced Thornetta Davis\'s Sunday Morning Coming Down a gospel album at the same time.

His on-again-off-again relationship with Kelly South resulted in a son, Robert James Ritchie Jr. Hard-pressed for cash and with a kid on the way, Kid Rock released monthly demo tapes dubbed "The Bootleg Series" which featured demos of him and other up-and-coming rappers and garage rock bands in the Detroit area. Around the same time, Kid Rock formed his back up band, Twisted Brown Trucker. He later recruited [[Joe C.|Joseph "Joe C." Calleja]], whom he met at a 1994 concert in [[Roseville, Michigan]], as part of the group. In 1995, Rock took a job as a janitor at Whiterooms Studios to pay studio fees. When he wasn\'t working, Kid Rock recorded the material that eventually made up his fourth album, \'\'[[Early Mornin\' Stoned Pimp]]\'\', which he released on his own label, Top Dog Records. The album was released on February 12, 1996. During the recording process, he met piano player Jimmie Bones, who soon joined the band. A loan from his father aided the release and Kid Rock sold 6,000 copies from the trunk of his car, sometimes after his concerts. This led to him re-releasing \'\'The Polyfuze Method\'\' as the \'\'Polyfuze Method Revisted\'\' in 1997, adding "I Am The Bullgod" and "Rollin On The Island" from \'\'Fire It Up\'\' and a demo called "Rain Check".

Lava/Atlantic Records A&R man Andy Karp starting following Kid Rock\'s career after seeing him in [[Cleveland]] in December 1996 and again in March 1997. Following a two song demo tape containing "Somebody\'s Gotta Feel This" and "I Got One For Ya", [[Jason Flom]] supported Karp in signing Kid Rock for $100,000.<ref name="Lava Record Deal">{{cite web| title=Interview Andy Karp Vice President of A&R at Lava/Atlantic in New York |publisher=AtlanticRecordsContact.com |url=http://www.atlanticrecordscontact.com/ |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> After being signed, Kid Rock would be arrested in a bar fight celebrating his signing.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It was there he wrote "Only God Knows Why". When recording sessions began, Atlantic wanted more of a rock sound and did not initially like "Cowboy", "Devil Without A Cause" and "Only God Knows Why." They asked Rock to take out the "I\'m going platinum" line on the title track\'s chorus, but he refused. With "Only God Knows Why" they didn\'t want a slow ballad at all, Kid Rock fought to have the song on the album. While the conflict slowed down production, \'\'[[Devil Without a Cause]]\'\' was completed on schedule with Rock mostly playing all the instruments himself. He was mainly aided by local musicians Kenny Tudrick and Bobby East.

On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released \'\'[[Devil Without a Cause]]\'\' behind the single "Welcome 2 The Party" and Kid Rock went on the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] to support the album. Kid Rock released a low budget music video of of the song.Sales of "Welcome 2 The Party" and \'\'Devil\'\' were slow, though the 1998 Warped Tour in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] stimulated regional interest in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New England]]. This led to substantial airplay of the single "I Am The Bullgod" during the summer and fall of 1998 on Massachusetts rock staples [[WZLX]] and [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]].

\'\'\'Aaron Lewis\'\'\' (born April 13, 1972) is an American musician, who is the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and founding member of the [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Staind]], with whom he has released seven studio albums. He has since ventured into [[country music]] with his debut solo album \'\'[[Town Line]]\'\', an [[extended play|EP]] that was released on March 1, 2011 on [[Stroudavarious Records]].  Lewis\' first full-length solo release \'\'[[The Road (Aaron Lewis album)|The Road]]\'\' was released by Blaster Records on November 13, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wyland|first=Sarah|title=Aaron Lewis Plans an \xe2\x80\x98Endless Summer\xe2\x80\x99|url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2012/08/29/aaron-lewis-plans-an-endless-summer/|accessdate=August 30, 2012|newspaper=[[Great American Country]]|date=August 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Lewis was ranked #49 in the \'\'Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists\'\' by \'\'[[Hit Parader]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=63106 |title=Blabbermouth.net Heavy Metal\'s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists \xe2\x80\x93 Dec. 1, 2006 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref>

==Early life==
Lewis grew up, largely, in [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]], then moved to the Forest Park section of nearby [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] from 8th grade through high school. His mother is Jewish with origins in Russia, Poland and Germany and his father is Catholic of Italian, Welsh and English origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staind.com/forum/topics/faith-1?commentId=2223627%3AComment%3A172361 |title=Faith |publisher=STAIND |date=November 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref> Lewis attended [[Hebrew school]] in his youth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staind.com/forum/topics/faith-1?commentId=2223627%3AComment%3A172822 |title=Faith |publisher=STAIND |date=November 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref> His hobbies include [[Recreational fishery|fishing]], playing [[golf]], riding his [[motorcycle]] and [[dirt bike]], and hunting. He has worked in [[landscaping]], cleaned hotel rooms, and played solo acoustic sets in bars, pool halls, restaurants and coffeehouses.

==Career==
Lewis was, before Staind, in a band known as  J-CAT<ref>{{cite web|title=J.C.A.T Biography <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE -->|url=http://www.geocities.com/btcstaind/jcat.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5klW9JcME|archivedate=October 24, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> with Tori Sands, Chris Ballini, and former [[Staind]] bandmate [[Jon Wysocki]]. An album surfaced on the [[internet]] with nine of J-CAT\'s performances at Club Infinity in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The performances were recorded while \'\'[[Dysfunction (album)|Dysfunction]]\'\' was being recorded. Two of Staind\'s popular singles\xe2\x80\x94[[Outside (Staind song)|"Outside"]] and "[[It\'s Been Awhile]]"\xe2\x80\x94were both originally performed by J-CAT with somewhat different lyrics. Lewis has stated in multiple interviews that music has always been his outlet for getting the feeling off his chest. He\'s often called one of the most versatile artists of modern times{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, since he\'s played such a big variety of song types, from metal to traditional country. He met Staind lead guitarist Mike Mushok at a Christmas party in 1993, where they became acquainted. Mike told him about plans on starting a band; however, around that time, Lewis was actually homeless in the New England area. They were going to name the band Staind with the correct dictionary spelling of \'stained\', but a punk rock group called [[Lit (band)|Lit]] had previously used that band name with the same spelling. Lewis says out of respect for the band, they dropped the \'e\' in the word \'stained\' for their own signature band name. Lewis\' music has often focused on his family\'s issues (until his Country music surfaced, now that he and his parents are closer) and his struggles of growing up. He won\'t comment much on his childhood, but says he had low self-esteem back then (not necessarily now) and that he was often depressed and often "felt very alone". His songs have become much more positive over the years than in the beginning, but he\'s stated that his lyrics are always reality-based, and he believes it\'s why so many have had a strong personal connection to his music over the years. Most fans who\'ve met Lewis say he can be shy when he\'s not on-stage but friendly, down-to-earth, and one who possesses an upbeat attitude about life. He\'s said in interviews that he\'s never desired to wear much of a celebrity image; that though he\'s pleased with the success he\'s had in music, he also enjoys the fact that he can go places with his daughters and people still won\'t recognize him as Aaron Lewis or come up to him. He\'s an outdoor kind of person (growing up in the Massachusetts countryside) and is very family-oriented. His feelings on raising a child of his own were expressed in the Staind song he wrote about his daughter, "Zoe Jane". He calls it the song he\'s most proud of writing (AskMen.com interview). On August 1, 2014, Lewis was on hand to roll the first dice and perform at the opening of The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Sioux City, Iowa.

===Solo career===
Lewis has been performing solo acoustic shows since he was 17 and still does today. He has written and performed many songs that have never been officially released such as "Angel", "Something Like Me", "Bonghits for Breakfast" (originally performed with J-CAT), and "Sleeping at the Wheel".

In July 2010, Lewis finished recording a [[country music]] EP entitled \'\'[[Town Line]]\'\' that was released March 1, 2011 on [[Stroudavarious Records]]. It features seven tracks including three versions of the first single "[[Country Boy (Aaron Lewis song)|Country Boy]]" featuring [[George Jones]], [[Charlie Daniels]], and [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]], as well as the songs "Massachusetts", "Vicious Circles", "The Story Never Ends", and a re-recording of "Tangled Up in You" originally from \'\'[[The Illusion of Progress]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/aaron-lewis-talks-town-line-alice-in-chains-christmas-and-george-jones/8195933 |title=Aaron Lewis Talks "Town Line," Alice In Chains, Christmas and George Jones - ARTISTdirect News |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date=|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> Lewis said in a July 2011 interview that he was introduced to country music as a child by his grandfather, but his interest was recently rekindled when he toured with [[Kid Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revuewm.com/sounds/on-tour/item/1163-aaron-lewis-drastic-genre-crossover |title=Aaron Lewis: Drastic Genre Crossover |publisher=Revuewm.com |date=|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

Lewis released his first full solo album, \'\'[[The Road (Aaron Lewis album)|The Road]]\'\', in November 2012. Its debut single, "Endless Summer", has also made the country charts.  Lewis wrote every song on the 10 track collection, except for "Grandaddy\'s Gun" which was penned by Dallas Davidson, Rhett Akins, and Bobby Pinson, which marks the first time Lewis has recorded outside material for an album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aaron Lewis Reveals Album Details|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2012/03/aaron-lewis-reveals-album-details/}}</ref>  In an interview with Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard, Lewis said he recorded "Grandaddy\'s Gun" as both a compliment to a friend, and because he was pressed for time.<ref name="Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard">{{cite web|title=Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard|url=http://broadwayselectricbarnyard.com/2012/11/17/aaron-lewis-smoked-with-cheech/}}</ref> 

Lewis is currently working on material for his second full-length solo album, which he hopes to have released in early 2016.  <ref>{{cite web|title=Aaron Lewis stays true to traditional country roots|url=http://www.kansas.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article12868616.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Staind singer\'s shift to country is all about outlook|url=http://www.mrt.com/entertainment/article_49ba236a-cdbf-11e4-ac3e-3b188ad95d7b.html}}</ref>
[[File:Aaron Lewis 2013.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Cleveland]] in 2013]]
Lewis has been performing some of this new material live.  Song titles include: "That Ain\'t Country", "Northern Redneck", "Mama", "Lost and Lonely", "Sinner", and "Stuck in These Shoes".

===Collaborations===
Lewis was featured on the song "No Sex" by [[Limp Bizkit]] on their album \'\'[[Significant Other]]\'\'. He was also featured on a remix of the song "[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]" on [[Linkin Park]]\'s album \'\'[[Reanimation (album)|Reanimation]]\'\' (the remix is titled "Krwlng" on the album), as well as [[Cold]]\'s album \'\'[[13 Ways to Bleed on Stage]]\'\'. He contributed vocals to the song "Follow" on [[Sevendust]]\'s third album, \'\'[[Animosity (Sevendust album)|Animosity]]\'\', and to the songs "Bleed" and "Send in the Clowns" by the band [[Cold (band)|Cold]]. He\'s also featured on [[Jimmie\'s Chicken Shack]]\'s song "Falling Out", the only single off their 2004 album \'\'[[re.present]]\'\'. In December 2010 while promoting his \'\'[[Town Line]]\'\' album Lewis collaborated with [[Corey Taylor]] for a one night only [[acoustic music|acoustic]] duet show covering songs such as [[Pearl Jam]]\'s "Black", [[Pink Floyd]]\'s "[[Comfortably Numb]]", and [[Alice In Chains]]\' "[[Down In A Hole]]." Lewis told Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard that he\'s open to collaborating with anyone.  When asked specifically about [[Jason Aldean]], whom he shouts out in "Endless Summer," Lewis said, "Yeah."<ref name="Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard"/>

===Carrie Underwood controversy===
In July 2012, Lewis criticized [[Carrie Underwood]] for recording "Last Name."<ref>{{cite web|title=Aaron Lewis is critical of Carrie Underwood|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bACztcg77NE}}</ref>  Lewis said he did not mean the things he said specifically about her, but added that he would not record songs that aren\'t a direct representation of himself, and that he thought the song was a misrepresentation of herself. In the song she talked about hooking up with a guy in a club, knowing little about him (not even his last name), and waking up in Las Vegas, hung over, forgetting her own last name. She asks herself what she\'d done and talks about getting married to him. The song won a Grammy but Lewis was surprised by the lyrics and potential bad message to her young fans, originally thinking the lyrics "made her sound like a complete whore." Though she had partial writing credits on the song, Lewis disagreed that she even wrote much or came up with the lyrics and meaning herself, believing she just picked it from her songwriters, whom he believed must have actually written the song for her.<ref name="Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard"/>

===2014 Rockfest===

At the 2014 Rockfest, Aaron Lewis scolded some men for groping a teenage female fan while she was crowd surfing. He said this, giving a strong warning at the end:

"All right, listen up you fucking assholes. That fucking girl right there is like 15 fucking years old, and you fucking pieces of shit are molesting her while she\'s on the fucking crowd." \xe2\x80\x9cYour fucking mothers should be ashamed of themselves, you pieces of shit. You should all be fucking beaten down by everyone around you for being fucking pieces of shit. If I fucking see that shit again, I swear to God, I will point you out in the crowd and have everyone around you beat your fucking ass.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6106414/aaron-lewis-rant-crowd-surf-kansas-city-staind | title = Aaron Lewis Scolds Grabby Audience in Onstage Rant: \'Your Mothers Should Be Ashamed\' (Video) | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = June 2, 2014 |accessdate= June 10, 2014}}</ref>

===2014 World Series Performance===

At the 2014 World Series Game 5, Aaron Lewis flubbed the National Anthem. Instead of singing "at the twilight\'s last gleaming," Lewis sang, "were so gallantly streaming," words that come later on. Lewis released a statement of apology, stating, ""All I can say is I\'m sorry and ask for the Nation\'s forgiveness. My nerves got the best of me and I am completely torn up about what happened. America is the greatest country in the world. The Star-Spangled Banner means so much to so many, including myself. I hope everyone can understand the intensity of the situation and my true intent of this performance. I hope that the Nation, Major League Baseball and the many fans of our national pastime can forgive me." <ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mercurynews.com/giants/ci_26807258/watch-singer-flub-national-anthem-before-game-5 | title = Watch singer flub National Anthem before Game 5 of World Series at AT&T Park, players react, singer apologizes | publisher = [[San Jose Mercury News]] | date = October 27, 2014 |accessdate= October 27, 2014}}</ref>

\'\'\'Ingram Cecil Connor III\'\'\' (November 5, 1946 \xe2\x80\x93 September 19, 1973), known professionally as \'\'\'Gram Parsons\'\'\', was an American singer, songwriter, [[guitarist]], and [[pianist]]. Parsons is best known for his work within the [[country music]] genre; he also popularized what he called "Cosmic American Music", a hybrid of country, [[rhythm and blues]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Rock music|rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1217687|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Archive, Vol. 1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969 review|last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=Allmusic |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8|page=274}}</ref> Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the [[International Submarine Band]], [[The Byrds]], and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]. His relatively short career is described by [[AllMusic]] as "enormously influential" for country and rock, "blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other."<ref name="Allmusic Parsons">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5109|pure_url=yes}}|title=Gram Parsons Biography|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|work=Allmusic|accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref>

Parsons was born in [[Winter Haven, Florida]] and developed an interest in country music while attending [[Harvard University]]. He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966, and after several months of delay their debut, \'\'[[Safe at Home]]\'\', was released in 1968, by which time the group had disbanded. Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968, and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\' album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd [[Chris Hillman]] formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969, releasing their debut, \'\'[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]\'\', the same year. The album was well received but failed commercially; after a sloppy cross-country tour, they hastily recorded \'\'[[Burrito Deluxe]]\'\'. Parsons was fired from the band before its release in early 1970. He soon signed with [[A&M Records]], but after several unproductive sessions he canceled his intended solo debut in early 1971. Parsons moved to France, where he lived for a short period at [[Villa Nellc\xc3\xb4te]] with friend [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]]. Returning to America, Parsons befriended [[Emmylou Harris]], who assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, \'\'[[GP (album)|GP]]\'\', released in 1973. Although it received enthusiastic reviews, the release failed to chart; his next album, \'\'[[Grievous Angel]]\'\' met with a similar reception, and peaked at number 195 on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'. Several years of alcoholism and drug abuse severely deteriorated his health, and he died in 1973 at the age of 26.

Since his death, Parsons has been recognized as an extremely influential artist, credited with helping to found both [[country rock]] and [[alt-country]].<ref name="Allmusic Parsons"/> His posthumous honors include the [[Americana Music Association]] "President\'s Award" for 2003, and a ranking at No.&nbsp;87 on \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\'\'s list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time."{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2005}}

==Life and career==

===Early years (1946\xe2\x80\x9367)===
Ingram Cecil Connor III was born on November 5, 1946, in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], to Ingram Cecil ("Coon Dog") and Avis (n\xc3\xa9e Snively) Connor.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} The Connors normally resided at their main residence in [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but Avis traveled to her hometown in Florida to give birth.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} She was the daughter of [[citrus]] fruit magnate [[John A. Snively]], who held extensive properties in [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] and in Waycross. Parsons\' father was a famous [[World War II]] [[flying ace]], decorated with the [[Air Medal]], who was present at the 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=7}} Biographer David Meyer characterized Parson\'s parents as loving, writing in \'\'Twenty Thousand Roads\'\' that they are "remembered as affectionate parents and a loving couple".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} However, he also notes that "unhappiness was eating away at the Connor family": Avis suffered from depression, and both parents were [[alcoholic]]s.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37}} Parsons\' father committed [[suicide]] two days before [[Christmas]] in 1958, devastating the young Gram and the rest of the Connor family.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=37-49}} Avis subsequently married Robert Parsons, whose [[surname]] was adopted by Gram. Gram attended the prestigious [[Bolles School]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. For a time, the family found a stability of sorts. They were torn apart in early 1965, when Robert became embroiled in an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] and Avis\' heavy drinking led to her death from [[cirrhosis]] on July 5, 1965, the day of Gram\'s graduation from Bolles.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=139-143}}

As his family disintegrated around him, Parsons developed strong musical interests, particularly after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] perform in concert on February 22, 1956, in Waycross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1956.html |title=Elvis Presley 1956 : The King of Rock \'n\' Roll |publisher=Elvispresleymusic.com.au |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref> Five years later, while barely in his teens, he played in [[rock and roll]] cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the Winter Haven/Polk County area. By the age of 16 he graduated to [[folk music]], and in 1963 he teamed with his first professional outfit, the Shilos, in Greenville, South Carolina. Heavily influenced by [[The Kingston Trio]] and the Journeymen,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gram Parsons - The Early Years: 1960-1965|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp1.html|accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref> the band played [[Hootenanny|hootenannies]], [[coffee house]]s and [[high school]] auditoriums. Forays into New York City\'s [[Greenwich Village]] included appearances at [[The Bitter End]].

After The Shilos broke up, Parsons attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied [[theology]] but departed after one semester. Despite being from the [[U.S. Southern States|South]], he did not become seriously interested in [[country music]] until his time at Harvard, where he heard [[Merle Haggard]] for the first time. In 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the [[International Submarine Band]]. They relocated to [[Los Angeles]] the following year, and after several lineup changes signed to [[Lee Hazlewood]]\'s [[LHI Records]], where they spent late 1967 recording \'\'[[Safe at Home]]\'\'. The album contains one of Parsons\' best-known songs, "Luxury Liner", and an early version of "Do You Know How It Feels", which he revisited later on in his career. \'\'Safe at Home\'\' would remain unreleased until mid-1968, by which time the International Submarine Band had broken up.

===The Byrds (1968)===
By 1968 Parsons had come to the attention of [[The Byrds]]\' [[bassist]], [[Chris Hillman]], via Larry Spector (The Byrds\' business manager), as a possible replacement band member following the departures of [[David Crosby]] and [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] from the group in late 1967.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=250\xe2\x80\x93253|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3810|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> Parsons had been acquainted with Hillman since the pair had met in a bank during 1967 and in February 1968 he passed an audition for the band, being initially recruited as a [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] but soon switching to [[rhythm guitar]] and vocals.<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="legacy">{{cite book|author=Fricke, David.|year=2003|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo: Legacy Edition (2003 CD liner notes)}}</ref>

===The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969\xe2\x80\x9370)===
[[File:Country Music Hall of Fame (5981921715).jpg|thumb|The \'\'Nudie suit\'\' of Parsons in the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in Nashville]]
Returning to Los Angeles, Parsons sought out Hillman, and the two formed [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] with bassist [[Chris Ethridge]] and [[pedal steel]] player [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]]. Their 1969 album \'\'[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]\'\' was a modernized version of the [[Bakersfield sound|Bakersfield]] style of country music made popular by [[Buck Owens]], and the band appeared on the album cover wearing [[Nudie Cohn|Nudie]] suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements. Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals "Christine\'s Tune" and "Sin City" were versions of the [[soul music]] classics "[[The Dark End of the Street]]" and "Do Right Woman", the latter featuring David Crosby on high harmony. The album\'s original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in LA during this period. The atypically pronounced (for Parsons) gospel soul influence on this album likely comes from his frequent jamming with [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Richards.

Though not a commercial success, the album was measured by [[rock critic]] [[Robert Christgau]] as "an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact." The album was recorded without a permanent drummer, but the group soon added original Byrd [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] on drums. Embarking on a cross-country tour via train, as Parsons suffered from periodic bouts of [[fear of flying]], the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities. Parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of [[psilocybin]] and [[cocaine]], so his performances were erratic at best, while much of the band\'s repertoire consisted of vintage [[honky-tonk]] and soul standards with few originals. Perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of "Hickory Wind" and "You Don\'t Miss Your Water". The other Burritos surfaced with the exception of Clarke, and the joint aggregation played several songs, including "[[Long Black Veil]]" and "Goin\' Back".

After returning to Los Angeles the group recorded "The Train Song", written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R&B legends [[Larry Williams]] and [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]]. Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single, it also flopped. Ethridge departed shortly thereafter. He was replaced by lead guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]], while Hillman reverted to bass.

By this time, Parsons\'s own [[recreational drug use|use of drugs]] had increased to the extent that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the Stones, who briefly relocated to America in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming \'\'[[Let It Bleed]]\'\' album and prepare for an autumn cross-country tour, their first series of regular live engagements since 1967. As they prepared to play the nation\'s largest sports arenas, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences; one night Jagger had to literally order Parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group.

The singer\'s dedication to the Rolling Stones was rewarded when the Burrito Brothers were booked as the opening act of the infamous [[Altamont Music Festival]]. Playing a short set including "Six Days on the Road" and "Bony Moronie", Parsons left on one of the final helicopters and attempted to pick up [[Michelle Phillips]]. "Six Days..." was included in \'\'[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]\'\', a documentary of the event.

With mounting debt incurred, A&M hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act, contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein ("To Love Somebody", "Lodi", "I Shall Be Released", "Honky Tonk Women"), and Larry Williams\' "Bony Moronie". This was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget. Faced with a dearth of new material, most of the material was hastily written in the studio by Leadon, Hillman, and Parsons, with two \'\'Gilded Palace of Sin\'\' outtakes thrown into the mix. The resulting album, entitled \'\'[[Burrito Deluxe]]\'\', was released in April 1970.

The album is considered less inspired than its predecessor, but it is notable for the Parsons-Hillman-Leadon song "Older Guys" and for its take on Jagger and Richards\' "Wild Horses"\xe2\x80\x94the first recording released of this famous song. Parsons was inspired to cover the song after hearing an advance tape of the \'\'[[Sticky Fingers]]\'\' album sent to Kleinow, who was scheduled to overdub a part on the song (Kleinow\'s part was not included on the released Rolling Stones version, though it is available on bootlegs). Jagger consented to the [[cover version]], so long as the Flying Burrito Brothers did not issue it as a single.

\'\'Burrito Deluxe\'\', like its predecessor, underperformed commercially but faced the double whammy of being lambasted by critics. Disenchanted with the band, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman, who was at his wits end after two years of babysitting Parsons. Under Hillman\'s direction, the group recorded two further LPs.

In a recent interview with [[American Songwriter]] Chris Hillman explained that, "The greatest legacy of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram is we were the alternative country band. We couldn\'t get on country radio and we couldn\'t get on rock radio! We were the outlaw country band for a brief period," says Hillman."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/|title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref>

===Solo career and touring with Emmylou Harris (1970\xe2\x80\x9373)===
Parsons signed a solo deal with A&M Records and moved in with producer [[Terry Melcher]] in early 1970.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=337-342}} Melcher, who had worked with The Byrds and [[The Beach Boys]] and had rejected producing unknown singer/songwriter [[Charles Manson]], was a member of the successful duo [[Bruce & Terry]], also known as The Rip Chords. The two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin, and as a result, the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. "Terry loved Gram and wanted to produce him ... But neither of them could get anything done," recalled [[Eve Babitz]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340}} "Long lost, the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina," writes David Meyer.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=341}} The recording stalled, and the master tapes were checked out, but there is conflict as to whether "Gram ... or Melcher took them".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340-341}} He accompanied the Rolling Stones on their 1971 U.K. tour in the hope of being signed to the newly formed [[Rolling Stones Records]], intending to record a duo album with Richards. Moving into [[Villa Nellc\xc3\xb4te]] with the guitarist during the sessions for \'\'[[Exile on Main St.|Exile on Main Street]]\'\', Parsons remained in a consistently incapacitated state and frequently quarreled with his much younger girlfriend, aspiring actress [[Gretchen Burrell]]. Eventually, Parsons was asked to leave by [[Anita Pallenberg]], Richards\' longtime domestic partner. Richards suggests in his autobiography "Life" that Mick Jagger may have been the real driver for Parsons\' departure given that Richards was spending so much time playing music with Parsons. Rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album, and while Richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on "Sweet Virginia", to this day nothing has been substantiated. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their 1972 tour to no avail.

After leaving the Stones\' camp, Parsons married Burrell in 1971 at his stepfather\'s New Orleans estate. Allegedly, the relationship was far from stable, with Burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while Parsons quashed her burgeoning film career. Many of the singer\'s closest associates and friends claim that Parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death; the couple had already separated by this point.

[[File:Gram Parsons.jpg|Parsons in 1972|thumb]]
Parsons and Burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship, visiting old cohorts like Ian Dunlop and [[Family (band)|Family]]/[[Blind Faith]]/[[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Ric Grech]] in England. With the assistance of Grech and one of the bassist\'s friends, a doctor who also dabbled in country music and is now known as [[Hank Wangford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Hank Wangford|publisher=The Gram Parsons Project|url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm|accessdate=2011-11-06}}</ref> Parsons eventually stopped taking heroin (a treatment suggested by [[William Burroughs]] proved unsuccessful).

He returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos, and at Hillman\'s request went to hear [[Emmylou Harris]] sing in a small club in [[Washington, D.C.]] They befriended each other and, within a year, he asked her to join him in Los Angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was enthusiastically signed to [[Reprise Records]] by [[Mo Ostin]] in mid-1972. \'\'[[GP (album)|GP]]\'\', released in 1973, featured [[Elvis Presley]]\'s lead guitarist [[James Burton]], and featured new songs from a creatively revitalized Parsons such as "Big Mouth Blues" and "Kiss the Children," as well as a cover of [[Tompall Glaser]]\'s "[[Streets of Baltimore]]".

Parsons, by now featuring Harris as his duet partner, played dates across the United States as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels. Unable to afford the services of Presley\'s band for a month, the band featured the talents of Colorado-based rock guitarist [[Jock Bartley]] (soon to skyrocket to fame with [[Firefall]]), veteran Nashville session musician [[Neil Flanz]] on pedal steel, [[Kyle Tullis]] on bass and former [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] drummer [[N.D. Smart]] (once described by Canadian folksinger [[Ian Tyson]] as "a psychotic [[redneck]]"). The touring party also included Gretchen Parsons\xe2\x80\x94by this point extremely envious of Harris\xe2\x80\x94and Harris\' young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]], who had served time with [[Charles Manson]] on [[Terminal Island]] in the mid-sixties and first met Parsons while working for the Stones in 1968. Kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse, limiting his [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly, but improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in [[Austin, Texas]] and at a filmed concert at Liberty Hall in Houston (with [[Neil Young]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] sitting in) and [[Max\'s Kansas City]] in New York City. According to a number of sources, it was Harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list. Nevertheless, the tour did absolutely nothing for record sales. While he had been in the vanguard with The Byrds and the Burrito Brothers, Parsons was now perceived as being too authentic and traditional in an era dominated by the stylings of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} whose sound Parsons disliked (although he did maintain cordial relations with [[Bernie Leadon]], a former member of the Eagles who left the group in 1975).

For his next and final album, 1974\'s posthumously released \'\'[[Grievous Angel]]\'\', he again used Harris and Burton for the sessions. The record received even more enthusiastic reviews than had \'\'GP\'\', and has since attained classic status. Its most celebrated song is a Parsons-Harris duet cover of "[[Love Hurts]]," a song that remains in Harris\' solo repertoire. Notable Parsons-penned songs included "$1000 Wedding," a holdover from the Burrito Brothers era, and "Brass Buttons," a 1965 opus which addresses his mother\'s alcoholism. Also included was a new version of "Hickory Wind" and "Ooh Las Vegas," co-written with Grech and dating from the \'\'GP\'\' sessions. Despite the fact that Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album ("In My Hour of Darkness", "Return of the Grievous Angel"), Parsons was highly enthused with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a serious, diligent mindset to his musical career, eschewing most drugs including alcohol during the sessions.

Before recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary three show mini-tour as the headline act in a Warner Brothers country-rock package. The backing band included [[Clarence White]], Pete Kleinow, and Chris Etheridge. On July 14, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in Palmdale, California while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the [[New Kentucky Colonels]]. At White\'s funeral, Parsons and Bernie Leadon launched into an impromptu touching rendition of "Farther Along"; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be [[cremated]] in Joshua Tree. Despite the almost insurmountable setback, Parsons, Harris, and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tour.

In the summer of 1973, Parsons\' [[Topanga Canyon]] home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] automobile. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufman\'s house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with members of New Jersey\xe2\x80\x93based country rockers [[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]] (whose members included [[Tony Bennett]]\'s sons, Danny and Dae Bennett as well as future [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] sideman and member of [[the Alpha Band]], multi-instrumentalist [[David Mansfield]]) and the [[proto-punk]] [[Jonathan Richman]] & the Modern Lovers, who were being managed by Kaufman. Richman credits Parsons with introducing him to acoustic-based music{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. Parsons is credited as producer on Quacky Duck\'s only album, \'\'Media Push\'\', released by Warner Bros. in 1974. According to the road manager of Quacky Duck, Parsons was, despite being frequently drunk, a kind soul who provided business and musical guidance to the younger band.

Before formally breaking up with Burrell, Parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings. While recording, he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friend\'s home and was instantly smitten. The woman turned out to be Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart of the singer from his Waycross, Georgia days. Like Parsons, Fisher had drifted west and became established in the Bay Area rock scene. A meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship, with Fisher dividing her weeks between Los Angeles and San Francisco at Parsons\' expense.

===Death===
In the late 1960s, Parsons became enamored with Joshua Tree National Monument (now [[Joshua Tree National Park]]) in southeastern [[California]]. After splitting from Burrell, Parsons would frequently spend his weekends in the area with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman. Parsons was scheduled to begin another tour in October 1973. Parsons decided to go on one more excursion before this tour. Accompanying him were Fisher, personal assistant Michael Martin, and Dale McElroy, Martin\'s girlfriend.

Less than two days after arriving, Parsons was discovered unresponsive in his bedroom. Attempts to revive him failed and death was officially pronounced at 12:15 am on September 19, 1973 at Hi-Desert Memorial Hospital.{{sfn|Fong-Torres|1991|p=3-4}} Parsons was 26 years old at the time of his death and the official cause of death was an overdose of [[morphine]] and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PT83&dq=%22Gram+Parsons%22+death+OR+dead+OR+died&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Gram%20Parsons%22%20death%20OR%20dead%20OR%20died&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches] By Jeremy Simmonds p. 66</ref><ref name="dope">[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html "What\'s up with the strange end of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons?"] from \'\'[[The Straight Dope]]\'\'</ref> According to Fisher in the 2005 biography \'\'Grievous Angel: An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons\'\', the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three regular users and thus he had likely overestimated his tolerance considering his experience with opiates. Fisher and McElroy were returned to Los Angeles by Kaufman, who dispersed the remnants of Parsons\' stash in the desert.

Parsons\' body disappeared from the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] where it was being readied to be shipped to [[Louisiana]] for burial. Before his death, Parsons stated that he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over Cap Rock, a prominent natural feature there; however, Parsons\' stepfather organized a private ceremony back in New Orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry.<ref name="dope" /> Two accounts state that Bob Parsons stood to inherit Gram\'s share of his grandfather\'s estate if he could prove that Gram was a resident of Louisiana, explaining his eagerness to have him buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strange Death of Gram Parsons: 1973|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |title=Gram Parsons Project, interview with Phil Kaufman |publisher=Gramparsonsproject.com |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>

[[File:Gram Parsons Memorial.jpg|thumb|Parsons\' makeshift memorial in [[Joshua Tree, California]]]]
To fulfill Parsons\' funeral wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole his body from the airport and in a borrowed hearse drove it to Joshua Tree. Upon reaching the Cap Rock section of the park, they attempted to [[cremation|cremate]] Parsons\' corpse by pouring five gallons of gasoline into the open coffin and throwing a lit match inside. What resulted was an enormous fireball. The police gave chase but, as one account puts it, "were encumbered by sobriety," and the men escaped.<ref name="dope" /> The two were arrested several days later. Since there was no law against stealing a dead body, they were only fined $750{{sfn|Fong-Torres|1998|p=4}} for stealing the coffin and were not prosecuted for leaving {{convert|35|lb}} of his charred remains in the desert. Parsons\'s body was eventually buried in Garden of Memories Cemetery in Metairie, Louisiana.

The site of Parsons\' cremation was marked by a small concrete slab and was presided over by a large rock flake known to [[rock climbing|rock climbers]] as \'\'The Gram Parsons Memorial Hand Traverse\'\'.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pif&GRid=3110&PIgrid=3110&PIcrid=182669&ShowCemPhotos=Y& Gram Parsons] from [[Find A Grave]]</ref> The slab has since been removed by the U.S. National Park Service, and relocated to the Joshua Tree Inn.

==Legacy==
[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] describes Parsons as "enormously influential" for both country and rock, "blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other. ... His influence could still be heard well into the next millennium."<ref name="Allmusic Parsons"/> In his essay on Parsons for \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine\'s "100 Greatest Artist" list, [[Keith Richards]] notes that Parsons\' recorded music output was "pretty minimal." But nevertheless, Richards claims that Parsons "effect on country music is enormous[, t]his is why we\'re talking about him now."{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2005|}}

The 2003 film \'\'[[Grand Theft Parsons]]\'\' stars [[Johnny Knoxville]] as [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]] and chronicles a farcical version of the theft of Parsons\' corpse. In 2006, Gandulf Hennig directed documentary film titled \'\'Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel\'\' was released.

[[Emmylou Harris]] has continued to champion Parsons\' work throughout her career, covering a number of his songs over the years, including "Hickory Wind", "Wheels", "Sin City", "Luxury Liner", and "Hot Burrito No.&nbsp;2".  Harris\' songs "[[Boulder to Birmingham]]", from her 1975 album \'\'[[Pieces of the Sky]]\'\', and "The Road", from her 2011 album \'\'[[Hard Bargain (Emmylou Harris album)|Hard Bargain]]\'\', are tributes to Parsons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  In addition, her 1985 album \'\'[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]\'\' is an original concept album that includes many allusions to Parsons in its narrative.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  The song "My Man", written by [[Bernie Leadon]] and performed by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] on their album \'\'[[On the Border]]\'\', is a tribute to Gram Parsons.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Eagles - On the Border review|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6475|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> Both Leadon and Parsons were members of the Flying Burrito Brothers during the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Flying Burrito Brothers Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4284|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref>

The 1973 album "[[Crazy Eyes]]" by [[Poco]] pays homage to Parsons, as Richie Furay composed the title track in honor of him, and sings one of Parsons\' own compositions, "Brass Buttons."  The album was released four days before Parsons died.

In its 1995 album \'\'Stone\'\', the Canadian band [[Crash Vegas]] included a tribute song to Parsons titled \'\'September Morning\'\'.<ref>{{cite news|title=CD Reviews|last1=Brooks|last2=Wilson|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|date=27 April 1993|page=5}}</ref>

A music festival called Gram Fest or the Cosmic American Music Festival was held annually in honor of Parsons in Joshua Tree, California, between 1996 and 2006. The show featured tunes written by Gram Parsons and Gene Clark as well as influential songs and musical styles from other artists that were part of that era. Performers were also encouraged to showcase their own material. The underlying theme of the event is to inspire the performers to take these musical styles to the next level of the creative process. Past concerts have featured such notable artists as Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Chris Ethridge, Spooner Oldham, John Molo, Jack Royerton, Gib Guilbeau, [[Counting Crows]], Bob Warford, Rosie Flores, David Lowery, Barry & Holly Tashian, George Tomsco, Jann Browne, [[Lucinda Williams]], Polly Parsons, The "Road Mangler"- Phil Kaufman, Ben Fong-Torres, Victoria Williams & Mark Olson, Sid Griffin, as well as a variety of many other bands that had played over the 2 or 3 day event. In addition, the Gram Parsons Tribute, in Waycross, Georgia, is a music festival remembering Parsons in the town in which he grew up. Additional tributes spring up every year, the latest being the  Southern California "Gram On!" celebration by The Rickenbastards in July, 2013, celebrating the life and legacy of a simple country boy with a dream, Gram Parsons.

In 2007, [[La Maison Tellier (group)|La Maison Tellier]] released their album \'\'Second souffle\'\' which contained a song entitled "The Last Days of Gram Parson".

In February 2008, Gram\'s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, [[Emmylou Harris]], was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Despite his influence, however, Parsons has yet to be inducted. [[Radley Balko]] has written that "Parsons may be the most influential artist yet to be inducted to either the Rock and Roll or Country Music Hall(s) of Fame. And it\'s a damned shame."<ref>{{cite web|last=Balko|first=Radley|authorlink=Radley Balko|title=Gram Parsons Night at The Basement. Plus: Put Gram in the Hall.

On September 19, 2008, the 35th anniversary of Parsons\' death, it was first presented to the [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) and Hall as a "List of Supporters" together with the official Nomination Proposal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://graminternational.wordpress.com/2011/11/29/is-gram-parsons-eligible-for-induction-based-on-cma-criteria/ |title=Nomination Proposal to Induct Gram Parsons Into the Country Music Hall of Fame  |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref> The online List of Supporters reached 10,000 on the 40th anniversary of his death, with more than 12,000 currently listed. Annual Gram InterNational concerts in Nashville and various other cities support the petition cause as do other such tribute events.

In November 2009, the [[musical theatre]] production \'\'Grievous Angel: The Legend of Gram Parsons\'\' premiered, starring Anders Drerup as Gram Parsons and Kelly Prescott as Emmylou Harris.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gram Parsons project; Ottawa play raises iconic musician back to life|publisher=Legendofgramparsons.com|url=http://www.legendofgramparsons.com/docs/CitizenSunGrievous.pdf|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> Directed by Micheal Bate and co-written by Bate and David McDonald, the production was inspired by a March 1973 interview that Bate conducted with Parsons, which became Parsons\' last recorded conversation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grievous Angel: The Legend of Gram Parsons synopsis|publisher=Legendofgramparsons.com|url=http://www.legendofgramparsons.com/|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Sweden|Swedish]] folk duo [[First Aid Kit (band)|First Aid Kit]] released the single "Emmylou" from the album [[The Lion\'s Roar (album)|The Lion\'s Roar]].

\'\'\'Pirates of the Mississippi\'\'\' was an American [[country music]] group. It was founded in 1987 by Rich Alves ([[guitar]], [[Hammond organ]], [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]]), Bill McCorvey (guitar, [[lead vocals]]), Jimmy Lowe ([[Drum kit|drums]]), Pat Severs ([[steel guitar]], [[Dobro]]), and Dean Townson ([[bass guitar]]). Under this lineup, Pirates of the Mississippi made its debut in 1990 with a cover of [[Hank Williams]]\' "[[Honky Tonk Blues]]". This cover was the first single from their self-titled debut album. "Honky Tonk Blues" was followed by ten more singles, all of which charted between 1990 and 1995. in that same time span, the band would release four more studio albums and a compilation album. Severs was replaced by Greg Trostle in 1994, two years before the band was disestablished. In 2000, Alves and McCorvey reunited and began recording again as a duo, once again using the name Pirates of the Mississippi. The re-established lineup recorded another album, entitled \'\'Heaven and a Dixie Night\'\', in 2006 on CBuJ Entertainment.

==History==
Pirates of the Mississippi was formed in 1987, when [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] session musicians Bill McCorvey (lead vocals), Rich Alves (guitar), Dean Townson (bass guitar), Jimmy Lowe (drums), and Pat Severs (steel guitar) started performing together. Originally, they identified themselves as the We Don\'t Want a Freaking Record Deal Band,<ref name="pirates1">{{cite web |url=http://www.thepiratesofthemississippi.com/about.php?p=home |title=What\'s in a Name? |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090521131547/http://www.thepiratesofthemississippi.com/about.php?p=home |archivedate=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |work=Pirates of the Mississippi homepage}}</ref> but upon witnessing a group of fans wearing [[clog (shoe)|clogs]], the group changed its name to The Cloggers.

The Cloggers began playing various clubs around Nashville. Eventually, they attracted the attention of an [[artists and repertoire]] at Universal Records, a label owned by [[Jimmy Bowen]].<ref name="star">{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Asker |title=Pirate Power: After a rough start, it\'s smooth sailing for band |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3wsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WosDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4971,1081267&dq=feed-jake |work=[[The Free-Lance Star]] |date=6 April 1991 |accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> Executives at the label disliked the band\'s name, and suggested that they change it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pmtIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RFYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3709,6245288&dq=rich-alves&hl=en|title=Pirates of the Mississippi like their music loud|date=December 29, 1991|work=The Victoria Advocate|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The band then chose the name Pirates of the Mississippi because they thought that Lowe resembled a pirate.<ref name="pirates1"/> The band\'s debut album was finished by 1988, but its release was delayed until 1990 due to Universal being bought out by [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="star"/>

===Major-label albums===
In 1990, the band released its [[Pirates of the Mississippi (album)|self-titled debut album]] via Capitol. This album produced four chart singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. First was a cover of [[Hank Williams]]\'s "[[Honky Tonk Blues]]", which the band took to number 26 on the country charts.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=327|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Although "Rollin\' Home" peaked outside the top 40, the album\'s third single, "[[Feed Jake]]", became the band\'s biggest hit at number 15. The song, about a man who reminisces about a childhood friend while discussing societal stereotypes towards homeless people and homosexuals, was interpreted by some fans as having a pro-gay theme.<ref name="morning">{{cite news |first=Russell |last=Smith |title="Feed Jake" video clip gives rise to questions |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ACQSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w_ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5255,1477195&dq=feed-jake |work=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=4 July 1991 |accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> "Speak of the Devil", the last single from \'\'Pirates of the Mississippi\'\', also made the country top 40.

1991\'s \'\'[[Walk the Plank (Pirates of the Mississippi album)|Walk the Plank]]\'\', their second album for Capitol, was co-produced by Alves and [[Jimmy Bowen]].<ref name="plank"/> It included three singles: "Fighting for You", "\'Til I\'m Holding You Again", and "Too Much", written by [[Guy Clark]] and [[Lee Roy Parnell]]. Respectively, these peaked at 41, 22, and 36 on the country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Between the band\'s first two albums, the members performed all instruments themselves, except for the strings on "Feed Jake" and "Fighting for You", which were performed by John Kelton.<ref name="pirates liner"/><ref name="plank">{{cite AV media notes |title=Walk the Plank |others=Pirates of the Mississippi |year=1991 |publisher=Capitol Records Nashville |id=CDP 7 95798 2}}</ref>

After a restructuring of Capitol Nashville, the band was transferred to [[Liberty Records]], where they would release their third and fourth albums: \'\'[[A Street Man Named Desire]]\'\' (1992) and \'\'[[Dream You]]\'\' (1993). Each album\'s title track was the only charting single from it: "A Street Man Named Desire" peaked at number 56 and "Dream You" at number 63, their last single to make the charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> By 1994, a compilation album entitled \'\'[[The Best of Pirates of the Mississippi]]\'\' was issued. This compilation included several tracks from their first four albums, and newly recorded remixes. In 1995, the band signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] subsidiary [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]], releasing the non-charting singles "You Could Do Better" and "Sure Sign" for an album which would also have been titled \'\'Sure Sign\'\'. Also at this point, Greg Trostle replaced Pat Severs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/pirates-of-the-mississippi/article_17d1d7ae-ff22-5d9f-b05f-d3a9bd4e3eda.html|title=Pirates of the Mississippi|last=Wooley|first=John|date=21 January 1995|work=Tulsa World|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

Later in 1995, the band released \'\'[[Paradise (Pirates of the Mississippi album)|Paradise]]\'\', its only physical album for Giant. By this point, Trostle had left the band as well, and several [[session musician]]s performed on the album, including guitarist [[Dann Huff]], pianist [[Johnny Neel]], and backing vocalists [[John Wesley Ryles]] and [[Curtis Wright]]. [[David Malloy]] served as producer, with co-production from Stroud on three tracks.

===Reunion and statuses of former members===
In 2000, Rich Alves and Bill McCorvey decided to reunite as a duo, again assuming the name Pirates of the Mississippi. Three years later, original steel guitarist Pat Severs joined the house band on \'\'[[Nashville Star]]\'\', a [[talent show]] which originally aired on the [[USA Networks]] before transferring to [[NBC]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Paxman | first=Bob | title=Setting Sail Again: The Pirates of the Mississippi return to test the musical waters - this time as a duo | journal=[[Country Weekly]] | volume =13 | issue=20 | pages =58 | date =2006-09-25}}</ref> Alves and McCorvey were signed to CBuJ Entertainment/Evergreen Records in 2006, releasing the album \'\'[[Heaven and a Dixie Night]]\'\' that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=169&t=pirates_of_the_mississippi_back_together |title=Pirates of the Mississippi back together |work=[[Country Standard Time]]}}</ref> McCorvey founded an acoustic trio called Buffalo Rome, with which he performed from 2005 to 2010 before retiring to open a liquor store in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdh.columbiadailyherald.com/articles/2012/05/30/affiliate/brentwoodlife/news/02pirates.txt|title=A Pirate in Business|last=Linville|first=Jan|date=30 May 2012|work=Brentwood Life|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Original bass guitarist Dean Townson died of unknown causes on March 25, 2010, at the age of 50.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2010/04/01/pirates-of-the-mississippi-bassist-dean-townson-dies-at-50/ |title=Pirates of the Mississippi bassist Dean Townson dies at 50 |author=Peter Cooper |work=[[The Tennessean]] |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> Original drummer Jimmy Lowe returned to civilian life as a software engineer in 1996.

\'\'\'Pure Prairie League\'\'\', sometimes abbreviated \'\'\'PPL\'\'\', is an [[United states|American]] [[country-rock]] [[band (music)|band]] whose roots began between 1965 and 1969 in [[Waverly, Ohio|Waverly]], [[Ohio]], with [[Craig Fuller]], Tommy McGrail, Jim Caughlan, and John Call.  In 1970 McGrail named the band after a fictional 19th century [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] featured in the 1939 Errol Flynn cowboy movie \'\'[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]\'\'. The band has had a long run, active from the 1970s through the late 1980s and was revived in the late 1990s for a time, then again in 2004. As of 2014, they are still doing at least 100 shows a year.

==History==
Although the band has its roots in Waverly, Ohio, it was actually formed in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and had its first success in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. Fuller, McGrail, Caughlan and Call had played together in various bands since high school, notably the Omars and the Swiss Navy. 

The first Pure Prairie League recording was a George Ed Powell-[[songwriter|penned]] [[song|composition]], "(Break Me) Down to Pieces" with Powell ([[acoustic guitar]] and [[singer|vocals]]), Fuller ([[lead guitar]] and vocals), McGrail ([[drums]]), Kenny May ([[Bass guitar|bass]]) and David Workman (pedal [[steel guitar]]).

In 1970 the first solid PPL lineup was Fuller, McGrail, Powell, Phil Stokes on bass and Robin Suskind on guitar and [[mandola]], with steel guitar player John Call joining the band later that year. Call\'s steel guitar improved the country songs and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that contributed to the country-rock signature sound of the band.

In 1971 McGrail and Stokes set out to start a band with Bill Bartlett (of Beechwood Farm, [[Ram Jam]] and [[The Lemon Pipers]] fame). Jim Caughlan, who\'d played guitar and drums with Fuller, Call and McGrail in earlier bands, took over on drums and Jim Lanham from California replaced Stokes.

Early on, the PPL was looking for national artist representation and they made contact with a well-known Cleveland based rock and roll promoter, Roger Abramson. At the behest of Jim Westermeyer, PPL\'s roadie, Abramson saw the band at New Dilly\'s, a nightclub in the Mt. Adams area in Cincinnati and later signed them to a management contract. Abramson was able to obtain a recording deal with [[RCA]]. He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he was producing. Their eponymous first album used a [[Norman Rockwell]] [[Saturday Evening Post]] cover featuring a trail-worn cowboy, named Luke, who would appear on the cover of every PPL recording thereafter. After releasing their debut album in March 1972 (recorded in New York City) and embarking on a nationwide tour, Call, Caughlan and Lanham left the band. 

At that point the band owed RCA another album. Fuller, Powell, and producer Bob Ringe album decided to record the album RCA\'s [[Toronto]] (Canada) studio. In the summer of 1972 to begin work on album number two. The second album, \'\'Bustin\' Out,\'\' was produced, as was their debut, by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powell. Billy Hinds from Cincinnati (drums, percussion) and Hinds\' friend, Michael Connor, contributed [[piano]] to the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come. [[Mick Ronson]], of [[David Bowie]] and [[Mott the Hoople]] fame, contributed string arrangements on several tracks, most notably "Boulder Skies" and "Call Me Tell Me". Michael Reilly, who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band, joined them in early September 1972, after the record\'s completion. \'\'Bustin\' Out\'\' was released in October 1972.

Shortly afterward, the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in [[Kentucky]]. Before [[conscientious objector]] (C.O.) status could be arranged, he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave PPL in February 1973. At this point, RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak. 

By August 1973, the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that juncture. He was eventually given a full pardon by President [[Gerald Ford]]. 
Reilly took over as the band\'s leader and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn played in a popular Ohio band called Sacred Mushroom.

PPL hit the road and began playing gigs constantly, mostly in the Northeast, Midwest and Southeast. As a result of their heavy schedule, particularly at colleges, their songs became well known; "[[Amie (song)|Amie]]" (Craig Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s ode to an on-again/off-again relationship),  from the second album, became a particular favorite.

==A hit at last==
As "[[Amie (song)|Amie]]" grew in popularity, radio stations began receiving requests for it. As a result, RCA re-released \'\'Bustin\' Out\'\' and issued "Amie" as a single in late 1974. It peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on April 26, 1975, just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on midwestern college campuses.

RCA re-signed PPL and their third album, \'\'Two Lane Highway\'\', was released in April 1975. It featured guest appearances by [[Chet Atkins]], fiddler [[Johnny Gimble]], [[Don Felder]] from [[The Eagles]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], who dueted with the band on the song "Just Can\'t Believe It", which received much airplay on country stations. \'\'Highway\'\' was the band\'s highest \'charter\' at No.&nbsp;24 and \'\'Bustin\' Out\'\' reached Gold status. Their subsequent records \'\'If the Shoe Fits\'\' (January 1976), \'\'Dance\'\' (July 1976), \'\'Live, Takin\' the Stage\'\' (September 1977) and \'\'Just Fly\'\' (March 1978) sold in lesser quantities.

In 1977 Call left because of increasing back troubles. Larry Goshorn\'s brother, Tim, joined in time to record \'\'Just Fly\'\'. In 1978, there was a mass exodus as the Goshorns left to form their own group, The Goshorn Brothers, and Powell, the last remaining original member, retired from the road to run his pig farm in Ohio.

The group soldiered on as Reilly quickly brought in temporary members, California country rocker Chris Peterson (vocals, guitar) and the group\'s soundman, Jeff Redefer (guitar), to play a few shows until new, permanent players could be located.

In September 1978 auditions found [[Vince Gill]] (vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, fiddle), who had played with the [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] outfit Mountain Smoke, as well as Boone Creek (with [[Ricky Skaggs]]) and [[Byron Berline]] and his band Sundance. Further auditions brought in L.A. musician Steve Patrick Bolin (vocals, guitars, flute, saxophone) in January 1979. This revamped lineup recorded \'\'[[Can\'t Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can\'t Hold Back]]\'\' (June 1979), which turned out to be their last for RCA. Sax player Jeff Kirk accompanied the band on some of their dates during the 1979 tour.

[[Casablanca Records]], who at this time was trying to play down its reputation as a primarily [[disco]] label, signed PPL and other non-dance acts to its roster in 1980. In January, guitarist Jeff Wilson came in to replace Bolin and the band\'s 1980 release, \'\'[[Firin\' Up]]\'\' (February 1980) spawned the hits "[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]" and "I\'m Almost Ready" both sung by Gill, with [[saxophone]] accompaniment by [[David Sanborn]]. A second Casablanca release, \'\'[[Something in the Night]]\'\' (February 1981), kept PPL in the charts with "Still Right Here in My Heart". However, as fate would have it, Casablanca went bankrupt and was completely sold to [[Polygram Records]]. Polygram dropped most of Casablanca\'s roster, including PPL. Gill left in early 1982 and pursued a hugely successful solo career.

==The later years==
Despite the lack of a recording contract, the group still found itself in demand as a live act and played in clubs and at outdoor festivals.

Tim Goshorn returned in 1982 and Mike Hamilton (vocals, guitars, from [[Kenny Loggins]]\' band) also joined the same year and was there for 6 months. Al Garth (vocals, woodwinds, fiddle, keyboards), another Loggins alumnus ([[Loggins & Messina]], also [[Poco]] and [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]), joined from 1982-1985.

Longtime drummer Billy Hinds retired from the road in 1984. He was first succeeded by Merle Bregante (also ex-Loggins & Messina and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and then by Joel Rosenblatt (1985-1986) and Steve Speelman (ex-Steele) (1987-1988). Sax player Dan Clawson took over for Garth in 1985 and [[Gary Burr]] (vocals, guitars) was there from 1984 to 1985.

1985 also saw the return of PPL co-founder Craig Fuller (who had fronted the groups American Flyer and Fuller/Kaz in the mid-to-late 70s after he\'d returned to music).

\'\'Mementos 1971-1987\'\', which contained re-recordings of their best known material plus four new songs, was released on the small Rushmore label in late 1987 and had been recorded back in Ohio, where the band had returned their base. It featured guest appearances from many of the band\'s alumni, including Gill, Powell, the Goshorns, Call, Burr and Mike Hamilton.

In 1988 the band decided to call it a day. Fuller, who had already joined a reformed [[Little Feat]] in 1987, played with PPL for their final shows in the spring of 1988.

==Rebirth==
A decade later, PPL was back with a lineup of Fuller, Connor, Reilly, Burr, [[Fats Kaplin]] (pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, accordion, washboard) and Rick Schell (vocals, drums, percussion). After two years, Burr was succeeded by [[Curtis Wright]] (vocals, guitars) in June 2000. The group began work on a new album in 2002, yet abandoned the sessions and separated again after Schell became busy with other projects. After a long battle with cancer, Connor died on September 9, 2004.

Following Connor\'s death, the group resumed touring once again with Fuller, Reilly, Schell, Wright and Kaplin (when available) and released \'\'All in Good Time\'\' in November  2005. Their first album in 18 years, this release appeared on the small Drifter\'s Church label.

Since this time, PPL has continued to tour, playing a handful of shows every year. Donnie Lee Clark replaced Curtis Wright in 2006 after Wright joined [[Reba McEntire]]\'s band.  Mike Reilly was sidelined in 2006 after he was forced to undergo a liver transplant. Jack Sundrud (from [[Poco]]) came in to sub for Reilly. Rick Plant also did a brief stint with them on bass before relocating to Australia in late 2006. Jeff "Stick" Davis (from [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]) sat in on bass for Mike in 2007. In May 2007, Reilly appeared at a few shows and played guitar yet was unable to come back full-time until 2008. John David Call played some concerts in 2006 & 2007, standing in for Kaplin, and returned to the band full-time in June 2010.

As of May 2011, it was announced, via the PPL website, that Fuller would not be appearing at all of the band\'s shows that year since he decided to take a break from touring. 

On February 10, 2012, at The Syndicate in [[Newport, Kentucky]], Fuller, his son Patrick, Tommy McGrail, and George Ed Powell (a frequent guest at their Ohio shows in recent years) took to the stage to join the current PPL lineup of John David Call, Mike Reilly, Rick Schell and Donnie Lee Clark.

In May 2012 Scott Thompson (vocals, drums, percussion) replaced Rick Schell, who departed to pursue a career in real estate.    
 
The band endorses a number of charitable efforts, Pittsburgh\'s ongoing BurghSTOCK Concert Series among them.

\'\'\'Rascal Flatts\'\'\' is an American [[country pop]] music group formed in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1999. The band is composed of [[Gary LeVox]] ([[lead vocals]]) and second cousins [[Jay DeMarcus]] ([[bass guitar]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[background vocals]]) and [[Joe Don Rooney]] ([[electric guitar]], background vocals). DeMarcus is a brother-in-law of country singer [[James Otto]], and formerly one-half of the Christian music duo [[East to West]].

From 2000 to 2010, they recorded for [[Disney Music Group]]\'s [[Lyric Street Records]]. While on that label, they released seven albums, all of which have been [[music recording sales certification|certified]] platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In order of release, these albums are \'\'[[Rascal Flatts (album)|Rascal Flatts]]\'\' (2000), \'\'[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]\'\' (2002), \'\'[[Feels Like Today]]\'\' (2004), \'\'[[Me and My Gang]]\'\' (2006), \'\'[[Still Feels Good]]\'\' (2007), \'\'[[Greatest Hits Volume 1 (Rascal Flatts album)|Greatest Hits Volume 1]]\'\' (2008) and \'\'[[Unstoppable (Rascal Flatts album)|Unstoppable]]\'\' (2009). After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to the independent [[Big Machine Records]], for which they have released three more albums: \'\'[[Nothing Like This]]\'\' (2010), \'\'[[Changed (album)|Changed]]\'\' (2012), and \'\'[[Rewind (Rascal Flatts album)|Rewind]]\'\' (2014).

Their studio albums have accounted for more than 25 singles, of which 12 have reached No. 1 on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Country Songs]] and/or [[Country Airplay]]. Their longest-lasting No. 1 single, a cover of [[Marcus Hummon]]\'s "[[Bless the Broken Road#Rascal Flatts version|Bless the Broken Road]]", spent five weeks in that position in 2005. In 2005\xe2\x80\x9306, "[[What Hurts the Most#Rascal Flatts version|What Hurts the Most]]" was No. 1 on both the country and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and peaked at No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].

==History==
{{quote box|quote=We\'re not just business partners, we are good friends. That\'s why we have had the longevity we have.|source=Joe Don Rooney, 2006, \'\'People\'\' magazine<ref name=longevity>11/8/2006 "RASCAL FLATTS". \'\'People\'\'. \'\'\'66\'\'\':60</ref>|width=310px}}

Rascal Flatts\'s founding was at Fiddle and Steel Guitar Bar in Nashville, Tennessee. [[Gary LeVox]] and [[Jay DeMarcus]] are second cousins from a musical family.<ref name="allmusic"/> DeMarcus moved to Nashville in 1992, earning his first record deal as part of a Christian group called [[East to West]]; his brother-in-law, [[James Otto]], is also a country music singer. In 1997, DeMarcus called LeVox, and convinced him to come to Nashville and provide some harmonies on [[Michael English (singer)|Michael English]]\'s album \'\'Gospel\'\', which he was producing. They engineered the album together, and became English\'s back-up band.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Walt|title=Rascal Flatts: Taking kids to the country|url=http://www.cpyu.org/Page.aspx?id=149895|publisher=Center for Parent/Youth Understanding|accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref>

At the same time, DeMarcus had become the bandleader of [[Chely Wright]]\'s band, where he met [[Joe Don Rooney]], the guitarist in that band. DeMarcus and LeVox were working in a [[Printer\'s Alley]] nightclub<ref name="allmusic"/> and when their part-time guitarist could not make it one night, DeMarcus invited Rooney join them.

Singer [[Mila Mason]] recommended the group to record producers [[Mark Bright (record producer)|Mark Bright]] and Marty Williams,<ref>[http://www.voxmagazine.com/stories/2004/02/05/ruckus-raising-rascals-sorry-spanky-not-so-little-/ Vox Magazine - Ruckus-raising rascals: Sorry, Spanky!

After he\'d heard the demos, the band went into the Lyric Street offices the next day, sat down with acoustic guitars, and played a couple of songs. According to Howard in an interview with [[HitQuarters]]: "The vocals and harmonies, it was all there\xe2\x80\x94I was just blown away. The lead singer has such a unique and compelling voice."<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Doug_Howard_Interview.html |title=Interview with Doug Howard |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=10 Jul 2006 |accessdate=23 Nov 2010}}</ref> The band was signed to Lyric Street in late 1999.

==Musical career==

===2000\xe2\x80\x932005: \'\'Rascal Flatts\'\', \'\'Melt\'\', and \'\'Feels Like Today\'\'===
In early 2000, the group made its debut with the single "[[Prayin\' for Daylight]]", a song that had been on the three-song demo that had gotten the band signed.<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> The song, which reached #3 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' country charts, was the first single from their [[Rascal Flatts (album)|self-titled debut]], which was issued in early 2000 on Lyric Street.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p429157|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rascal Flatts biography |accessdate=2007-10-04 |last=Cohoon |first=Rick |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Following "Prayin\' for Daylight", the album\'s other three singles all made top ten on that chart: "[[This Everyday Love]]", "[[While You Loved Me]]", and "[[I\'m Movin\' On (Rascal Flatts song)|I\'m Movin\' On]]", which respectively peaked at #9, 7, and 4. "I\'m Movin\' On" was awarded Song of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in 2002.

The album was met with positive reviews. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called it "a sunny, pleasing modern country-pop album".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/rascal-flatts-r484829/review|title=\'\'Rascal Flatts\'\' review|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|work=Allmusic|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

\'\'[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]\'\' was the title of their second album, released in 2002. Unlike their previous album, Rascal Flatts co-produced \'\'Melt\'\'.<ref name="allmusic"/> Its first single, "[[These Days (Rascal Flatts song)|These Days]]", also became their first #1 single on the country chart.<ref name="allmusic"/> The album included two more top ten hits, "[[Love You Out Loud]]" and "[[I Melt]]", and the band\'s second #1 single, "[[Mayberry (Rascal Flatts song)|Mayberry]]". The [[music video]] for "I Melt" featured partial nudity<ref name="cmt">[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473779/20030714/rascal_flatts.jhtml Rascal Flatts Discuss Their Racy Video]</ref> and was banned from the [[Great American Country]] network.

Rascal Flatts\'s third album was entitled \'\'[[Feels Like Today]]\'\', released in late 2004. The album\'s [[Feels Like Today (song)|title track]] was its first single, followed by "[[Bless the Broken Road]]". The latter song was originally recorded by its co-writer, [[Marcus Hummon]], and had also been recorded by [[Melodie Crittenden]] (whose version made the country chart in 1998), [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], and [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]]. In early 2005, Rascal Flatts\'s version of the song spent five weeks at #1, followed by "[[Fast Cars and Freedom]]", which also hit #1. While the latter was climbing the charts, some radio stations began playing a [[hidden track]] on the album, titled "Skin". This airplay caused "Skin" to enter the top 40, and after "Fast Cars and Freedom", it was released as a single under the title "[[Skin (Sarabeth)]]" and officially added to the album\'s track list.

===2005\xe2\x80\x932007: \'\'Me and My Gang\'\' and \'\'Still Feels Good\'\'===
Rascal Flatts\'s thirteenth chart entry, "[[What Hurts the Most]]", was released in December 2005. This song, which had previously been recorded by [[Mark Wills]] in 2003, was the first single from their fourth album, 2006\'s \'\'[[Me and My Gang]]\'\'. For this album, the band worked with producer [[Dann Huff]]. "What Hurts the Most" was a crossover hit, reaching #1 at both country and adult contemporary, as well as top 10 on the Hot 100 chart. After it, the album\'s [[Me and My Gang (song)|title track]] charted in the top ten, and both "[[My Wish]]" and "[[Stand (Rascal Flatts song)|Stand]]" hit #1.

Also in 2006, the group charted in the top 10 of the Hot 100 with a cover of [[Tom Cochrane]]\'s "[[Life Is a Highway]]", which they recorded for the [[Pixar]] film \'\'[[Cars (film)|Cars]]\'\'. Although "Life Is a Highway" was not released to country radio, several country stations began playing the song, causing it to chart within the top 20 of Hot Country Songs.

\'\'Me and My Gang\'\' had the highest US debut of 2006, with 722,000 units in April.<ref>Christman, Ed (2006-10-07), "Million-Unit Question". \'\'Billboard\'\'. \'\'\'118\'\'\' (40):7</ref> The album spent 15 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was the second-best selling album of 2006 (behind \'\'[[High School Musical]]\'\') with sales totaling 3.5 million by year\'s end.<ref name=tucker>Tucker, Ken (2007-08-25), "CAN RASCAL REPEAT?" \'\'Billboard\'\'. \'\'\'119\'\'\' (34):20&ndash;22</ref> The album\'s success led the band to take the spot of top-selling artist for all genres of music, which hadn\'t been accomplished in 15 years by a country group.<ref>Rascal Flatts. 2008.

[[Carrie Underwood]] and Rascal Flatts performed together at the 2007 Grammy Awards ceremony.<ref>No byline (2007-02-09), "Performances dwarf the awards". \'\'USA Today\'\'</ref> Later the same year, the group released the single "[[Take Me There (Rascal Flatts song)|Take Me There]]", a song which [[Kenny Chesney]] co-wrote and had initially planned to record himself. It became a #1 country hit in September and was the first single from their album \'\'[[Still Feels Good]]\'\'. It was followed by "[[Winner at a Losing Game]]", the first single which the band wrote itself.<ref name="country">{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=Marianne |date=24 March 2008 |title=Story Behind the Song: "Winner at a Losing Game" |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |page=64 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> Both it and its followup "[[Every Day (Rascal Flatts song)|Every Day]]" peaked at #2 on the country chart. The fourth single from \'\'Still Feels Good\'\', "[[Bob That Head]]", became the band\'s first single to miss the top ten at country radio. The album\'s fifth and final single, "[[Here (Rascal Flatts song)|Here]]", was released in August 2008 and became their ninth Number One hit on the chart week of January 3, 2009.

The group performed "Summer Nights" at the \'\'[[CMT Music Awards]]\'\', \'\'[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]\'\'\'s Kickoff Party, and the finale of \'\'[[America\'s Got Talent]]\'\'. The third single off the album, "[[Why (Rascal Flatts song)|Why]]", peaked at No. 18 on the country charts. Rascal Flatts performed "Why" on \'\'[[The Tonight Show with Conan O\'Brien]]\'\'.

Ronstadt\'s early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.<ref name=AARP-07>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt : The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online |first=Anita Mabante |last=Leach |date= August 2007 |url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081222084100/http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html |archivedate= December 22, 2008 | accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref>

Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records{{spaced ndash}} rock \'n\' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi{{spaced ndash}} is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and her father for introducing her to the [[traditional pop]] and [[Great American Songbook]] repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.<ref name="Asheralbumsales">{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Interview 17 June 1998 at Linda\'s home in Tucson, Arizona | first=Debbie |last=Kruger | publisher=debbiekruger.com | date=June 17, 1998 | url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html | accessdate = July 6, 2007}}</ref><ref name=starbulletin/>

Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as [[Lola Beltr\xc3\xa1n]] and [[\xc3\x89dith Piaf]]; she has called their singing and rhythms "more like Greek music ... It\'s sort of like 6/8 [[time signature]] ... very hard driving and very intense."<ref name=influences>{{cite web | work=Hit Parader | title= Sanity on the Line Every Show | date=February 1971 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthitp1.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> She also drew influence from country singer [[Hank Williams]].

===Beginning of professional career===
At age 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Suzy. The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as "the Union City Ramblers" and "the Three Ronstadts", and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name "the New Union Ramblers".<ref name=MIXMag2000/> Their repertoire included the music they grew up on{{spaced ndash}} folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican.<ref name=ramblers>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt: The Queen of Rock & Roll is also a Queen of Country Music | work=Country Music Magazine | date=October 1978 | first=Russ |last=Barnard | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artcm78.htm | accessdate = May 11, 2007}}</ref> But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock \'n\' roll,<ref name=hamill /> and in 1964, after a semester at Arizona State University<ref name=ramblers />), the 18-year old decided to move to Los Angeles.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite journal |first=Randy |last=Lewis |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Linda Ronstadt remembers Kenny Edwards: \'A beacon to me\' |journal=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/linda-ronstadt-kenny-edwards.html}}</ref><ref name="Soulful"/><ref name="Claire">{{cite book |title=Linda Ronstadt |last=Claire |first=Vivian |year=1978 |publisher=Flash Books |location=New York  |isbn=0-8256-3918-2 |page=10 }}</ref>

===The Stone Poneys===
{{Main|Stone Poneys}}
Ronstadt visited a friend from Tucson, [[Bobby Kimmel]], in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday,<ref name=LATimes/> decided to move there permanently to form a band with him.<ref name="Soulful"/> Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter [[Kenny Edwards]], and eventually the three of them were signed by [[Nik Venet]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in the summer of 1966 as "[[the Stone Poneys]]". The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967\xe2\x80\x9368: \'\'[[The Stone Poneys (album)|The Stone Poneys]]\'\'; \'\'[[Evergreen, Volume 2]]\'\'; and \'\'[[Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III]]\'\'. The band is best known for their hit single "[[Different Drum]]" (written by [[Michael Nesmith]] prior to his joining [[the Monkees]]), which reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart as well as number 12 in \'\'[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]\'\' magazine. More than 45 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt\'s most popular recordings.<ref>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | publisher=Rhapsody | url=http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/linda-ronstadt | accessdate = April 1, 2009}}</ref>

Besides recording one of her most enduring songs, Ronstadt was already showcasing her highly expressive performance of an eclectic mix of songs, often from under-appreciated songwriters, utilizing a wide array of backing musicians. Additionally, many of her songs, including "Different Drum", were written by male songwriters and had minimal lyric changes, allowing Ronstadt to toy with [[gender roles]] that were in ferment in the 1960s and 1970s. While the Stone Poneys broke up before the release of their third album, Kenny Edwards recorded and toured with Ronstadt from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

In 2008 Australia\'s [[Raven Records]] released a compilation CD titled \'\'The Stone Poneys\'\'. The disc features all tracks from the first two Stone Poneys albums and four tracks from the third album.

===Solo career===
Still contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, \'\'[[Hand Sown ... Home Grown]]\'\', in 1969. It has been called the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.<ref name="Linen106"/> During this same period, she contributed to the \'\'[[Music From Free Creek]]\'\' "super session" project.

Ronstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for [[Remington Products|Remington]] electric razors, in which a multitracked Ronstadt and [[Frank Zappa]] claimed that the electric razor "cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted".<ref name=Remington>{{cite web | work= The Linda Ronstadt Download Center | title= Remington Electric Razor | url=http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html | publisher=westhamptonpg personal webpage|accessdate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>

Ronstadt\'s second solo album, \'\'[[Silk Purse (Linda Ronstadt album)|Silk Purse]]\'\', was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by [[Elliot Mazer]], whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of [[Janis Joplin]], who had worked with him on her \'\'Cheap Thrills\'\' album.<ref name=Capitol>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt\'s 1969\xe2\x80\x931974 Capitol Records Solo Output Presented in New 2-CD Collection, \'The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capitol Years\' | publisher=PR Newswire | date=November 8, 2005 | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-08-2005/0004211041&EDATE= | accessdate = September 30, 2007}}</ref> The \'\'Silk Purse\'\' album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single "Long Long Time", and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).

Several years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first "arena-class rock diva", with "hugely anticipated tours",<ref name="doubleplatinum"/> she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally. There were few "girl singers" on the rock circuit at the time, and they were relegated to "groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys", a status Ronstadt avoided.<ref name=groupie>{{cite web | work=Fusion Magazine | title= Female Rocker Roundup: Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Carey, Lydia Pense, Nansi Nevins - Part 1 |date=December 26, 1969 | first=Pete |last=Senoff | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intfus1.htm  | accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref> Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, and a series of boyfriend-managers.

Soon after she went solo in the late 1960s, one of her first backing bands was the pioneering country-rock band [[Swampwater]], famous for synthesizing [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and swamp-rock elements into their music. Its members included Cajun fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]] and John Beland, who later joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]],<ref name=swamprock>{{cite web | work=The Rising Storm | title= Swampwater "Swampwater" | author=jason | date=May 20, 2007 | url=http://therisingstorm.net/swampwater-swampwater/ | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> as well as Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell, and Eric White, brother of [[Clarence White]] of [[the Byrds]].

Another backing band featured players [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Bernie Leadon]], and [[Randy Meisner]], who went on to form the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on \'\'[[Linda Ronstadt (album)|Linda Ronstadt]]\'\', her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt\'s version of Browne\'s "[[Rock Me On the Water]]", was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]. She said, "As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims."<ref name=MIXMag2000/> Also in 1971, Ronstadt began talking with [[David Geffen]] about moving from Capitol Records to Geffen\'s [[Asylum Records]] label.<ref>See generally Tom King, \'\'The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood\'\', p. 159, 173, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref>

Ronstadt began her fourth solo album, \'\'[[Don\'t Cry Now]]\'\', in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with [[Asylum Records]]) and [[J. D. Souther|John David "J.D." Souther]] producing most of the album\'s tracks. But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked [[Peter Asher]], who came highly recommended to her by [[James Taylor]]\'s sister [[Kate Taylor]], to help produce two of them: "Sail Away" and "I Believe in You".<ref name="producer3"/>

The album featured Ronstadt\'s first country hit, "[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]", which she had first recorded on \'\'Hand Sown ... Home Grown\'\'{{spaced ndash}} this time hitting the Country Top 20.

With the release of \'\'Don\'t Cry Now\'\', Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on [[Neil Young]]\'s \'\'Time Fades Away\'\' tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before. Backstage at a concert in Texas, [[Chris Hillman]] introduced her to [[Emmylou Harris]], telling them, "You two could be good friends",<ref name=goldmine>{{cite web | title=And then there were two...

Asher turned out to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any producer she had worked with previously.<ref name=MIXMag2000>{{cite web | work=Mix Magazine| title=Linda Ronstadt |date=December 1, 2000 |first=Dan |last=Daley| url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt\'s professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio.<ref name="producer3"/> Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a "woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer,<ref name="negativequalities">{{cite web | title=Peter Asher Interview |first= Caroline |last=Ryder | work=[[Swindle (magazine)|Swindle]] |date= October 2007 |url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025181433/http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ |archivedate= October 25, 2007 |accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref> and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. "It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone\'s career when it\'s someone you sleep with", he said.<ref name="producer3"/>

Asher executive produced a tribute CD called \'\'[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]\'\', released September 6, 2011, on which Ronstadt\'s 1976 version of [[Buddy Holly]]\'s "[[That\'ll Be The Day]]" appears among newly recorded versions of Holly\'s songs by various artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/132169-listen-buddy-holly-tribute-cd-sept-6th.html |title=Listen To Me: Buddy Holly Tribute CD Out Sept. 6th |date=July 26, 2011 |publisher=AltSounds.com |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}

Ronstadt captured the sounds of [[country music]] and the rhythms of [[ranchera]] music{{spaced ndash}} which she likened in 1968 to \'\'"Mexican bluegrass"\'\'{{spaced ndash}} and redirected them into her rock \'n\' roll and some of her pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] roots.<ref name=Soulful>{{cite web | work=Cleveland Scene | title=Gypsy Eyes, Interview 1968| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdis.htm | accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref> Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusion of country music and rock \'n\' roll called [[Country rock]], started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music "purists" for her "brand of music" which crossed many genres. \'\'Country Western Stars\'\' magazine wrote in 1970 that "Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn\'t quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda."

More importantly, Ronstadt became a highly successful "album artist", with much material she had written.<ref name=MIXMag2000/>

Ronstadt\'s natural vocal range spans several octaves from [[contralto]] to [[soprano]], and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive platinum albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine pointed out that a whole generation, "but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Chuck Berry]]."<ref name="interpreter6">{{cite web |work=Rolling Stone | title=Artists: Linda Ronstadt Bio, Pictures, Video| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/linda-ronstadt/biography | accessdate = November 24, 2012}}</ref>

In the 1974 book \'\'Rock \'N\' Roll Woman\'\', author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt\'s "own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union."<ref name="Soulful"/>

By this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Swampwater]], [[Neil Young]], and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was okay. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more rock and roll.<ref name=goldmine/>

With the release of \'\'Heart Like a Wheel\'\', Ronstadt reached number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] chart;<ref name=BillboardWheelno1on200>{{cite web|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|title=Linda Ronstadt Rocks Highest-Charting Album In 24 Years|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6062513/linda-ronstadt-rocks-highest-charting-album-in-24-years|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> it was also the first of four number 1 Country Albums, and the disc was certified double-platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS RIAA Certifications]</ref> (over two million copies sold in the U.S.). In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings, and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of her interpretation and recording. Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists.

\'\'Heart Like a Wheel\'\'{{\'}}s first single release, "[[You\'re No Good]]"{{spaced ndash}} a rockified version of an R&B song written by [[Clint Ballard, Jr.]] that Ronstadt had initially resisted because [[Andrew Gold]]\'s guitar tracks sounded too much like a "Beatles song" to her<ref name="producer3"/>{{spaced ndash}} climbed to number 1 on both the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' and [[Cash Box]] Pop singles charts.<ref name=bronson>Bronson, Fred.  \'\'The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits\'\'.

The album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock, with \'\'Heart Like a Wheel\'\' her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first Grammy Award<ref name = 1stgrammy>{{cite web | title=\'Grammy.com: Grammy Award Winners\'| work=1975\xe2\x80\x9318th Annual Grammy Awards| url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx | accessdate = February 23, 2008}}</ref> for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance/Female]] for "I Can\'t Help It (If I\'m Still In Love With You)" which was originally a 1940s hit by [[Hank Williams]]. Ronstadt\'s interpretation peaked at number 2 on the country chart. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy.

\'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine put Ronstadt on its cover in March 1975. It was the first of six \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine covers shot by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by [[Ben Fong-Torres]], discussing Ronstadt\'s many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.

In September 1975, Ronstadt\'s album \'\'[[Prisoner In Disguise]]\'\' was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Album Chart and sold over a million copies.<ref name = RIAAsearch/> It became her second in a row to go platinum, "a grand slam" in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually become the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990).<ref name=people75/> The disc\'s first single release was "[[Love Is A Rose]]". It was climbing the pop and country charts but [[Heat Wave (Martha and the Vandellas song)|Heat Wave]], a rockified version of the 1963 hit by [[Martha and the Vandellas]], was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the "Love Is a Rose" single and issued "Heat Wave" with "Love Is a Rose" on the B-side. "Heat Wave" hit the Top Five on \'\'Billboard\'\'\'s Hot 100 while "Love Is A Rose" hit the Top Five on Billboard\'s country chart.

In 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of \'\'Billboard\'\'\'s Album Chart and won her second career [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her third consecutive platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch/> album \'\'[[Hasten Down the Wind]]\'\'. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, "Try Me Again" (co-authored with Andrew Gold) and "Lo Siento Mi Vida". It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson\'s classic "Crazy", which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.

At the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of \'\'Heart Like a Wheel\'\' with her album \'\'[[Simple Dreams]]\'\', which held the number 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 chart.<ref name=Billboardsimpledreams5weeks>{{cite journal|title=Billboard Jan 17, 2009|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=January 17, 2009|volume=121|issue=2|page=37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aKAOa7WLRrYC&pg=PT36&lpg=PT36&dq=%22simple+dreams%22+Ronstadt+billboard+five+weeks&source=bl&ots=mIyqI89esS&sig=3rXnDWhqySpI0Hf5D5WFwd7s538&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oTqGVITPDoKqogST7IGABA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22simple%20dreams%22%20Ronstadt%20billboard%20five%20weeks&f=false|publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> It sold over 3\xc2\xbd million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone - a record for a female artist. \'\'Simple Dreams\'\' spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts.

The album garnered several Grammy Award nominations{{spaced ndash}} including Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for "Blue Bayou"{{spaced ndash}} and won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.

\'\'Simple Dreams\'\' became one of the singer\'s best-selling international-selling albums as well, reaching number 1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts.<ref name="international">{{cite web | title=Ronstadt Facts, Investigative International Sales | work=Linda Ronstadt Record Sales Information Page (German Site) | url=http://lindaronstadt.de/facts.htm | accessdate = April 17, 2007}}</ref> \'\'Simple Dreams\'\' also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist as well. The same year, she completed a concert tour around Europe. As \'\'Country Music Magazine\'\' wrote in October 1978, \'\'Simple Dreams\'\' solidified Ronstadt\'s role as "easily the most successful female rock and roll \'\'and\'\' country star at this time."<ref name=ramblers />

Also in 1977, she was asked by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to sing the [[U.S. National Anthem]] at game three of the [[World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]].<ref name=nationalanthem>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Singing the National Anthem at Game three of World Series | publisher= [[YouTube]] | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxYYwE_ezE | accessdate = August 11, 2007}}</ref>

====\'\'Time\'\' magazine and Ronstadt\'s "rock chick" image====
Ronstadt has remarked that she felt as though she was "artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," which she felt wasn\'t worn quite [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]].<ref name=identitycrisis>{{cite web | title=Not My Job: Linda Ronstadt | publisher=NPR | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9888452 | accessdate = May 10, 2007 | date=April 28, 2007}}</ref> Female rock artists like her and [[Janis Joplin]], whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and the [[antithesis]] of the "red hot mamma" she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]].<ref name=identitycrisis />

[[File:RonstadtTime.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Ronstadt, on the cover of the February 28, 1977, issue of \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\'.]]
By the mid-1970s, Ronstadt\'s image became just as famous as her music.<ref name="Goldmine589"/> In 1976 and 1977, she appeared on the covers of \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' and \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\', respectively. The \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' cover story was accompanied by a series of photographs of Ronstadt in a skimpy red slip, taken by [[Annie Leibovitz]]. Ronstadt felt deceived by the photographer, not realizing that the photos would be so revealing. She says her manager Peter Asher kicked Leibovitz out of the house when she visited to show them the photographs prior to publication. Leibovitz had refused to let them veto any of the photos, which included one of Ronstadt sprawled across a bed in her underpants.<ref name="Goldmine589"/> In a 1977 interview, Ronstadt explained, "Annie [Leibovitz] saw that picture as an expose of my personality. She was right. But I wouldn\'t choose to show a picture like that to anybody who didn\'t know me personally, because only friends could get the other sides of me in balance."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rockwell|first=John|title=Linda Ronstadt: Her Soft-Core Charms|journal=New Times|date=14 October 1977|url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artnt77.htm|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

Her 1977 appearance on the cover of \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\' magazine under the banner "[[torch song|Torchy]] Rock" was also upsetting to Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock.<ref name=identitycrisis /><ref name=rockwell>{{cite book | title= Stranded{{spaced ndash}} Rock and Roll for a Desert Island | editor=Greil Marcus | contribution=Living in the USA | last=Rockwell | first=John | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/desertisle.htm | accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear,<ref name=Asherscomment>{{cite web | work=Mojo | title= Homecoming Queen, April 1995| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artmojo.htm | accessdate = May 11, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover,<ref name=identitycrisis /> and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project.<ref name=identitycrisis /> In 2004, she was interviewed for \'\'[[CBS This Morning]]\'\'<ref name=cbs>{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | publisher= [[CBS News]] |date=December 5, 2004 | url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/CBSNSM/CBS_SundayAM.html | accessdate = July 12, 2007}}</ref> and stated that this image was not her because she did not sit like that. Asher noted, "Anyone who\'s met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn\'t possibly have been her [[Svengali]]. She\'s an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism\'s about."<ref name=Asherscomment/> Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a "negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold".<ref name="negativequalities"/> Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the \'\'Time\'\' cover did not appear to help the situation.<ref name=backupband2/>

In 1978, \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine declared Ronstadt, "by far America\'s best-known female rock singer."<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/> She scored a third number 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart \xe2\x80\x93 at this point equaling the record set by Carole King in 1974 \xe2\x80\x93 with \'\'[[Living in the USA]]\'\'. She achieved a major hit single with "[[Ooh Baby Baby]]", with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country, R&B). \'\'Living in the USA\'\' was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advance copies).<ref name="doubleplatinum"/> The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.

At the end of that year, \'\'Billboard\'\' magazine crowned Ronstadt with three number 1 Awards for the Year: Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and Female Artist of the Year (overall).<ref name=TopFemale>{{cite web | work=Billboard | title=Congratulations | date=December 23, 1978 | url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html | accessdate = June 24, 2007}}</ref>

\'\'Living in the USA\'\' showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large American flag in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album<ref name="Goldmine589"/> and concert \xe2\x80\x93 which at the time were recorded live on radio or television.

Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film \'\'[[FM (film)|FM]]\'\', where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station\'s knowledge. The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me", "Love Me Tender", and "[[Tumbling Dice]]". Ronstadt was persuaded to record "Tumbling Dice" after [[Mick Jagger]] came backstage when she was at a concert and said, "You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs."<ref name=MickJagger>{{cite web | work=The Hit Parader Interview | title=Tour Reflections and Simple Dreams | date=March 1978 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm | accessdate = December 29, 2010}}</ref>

Following the success of \'\'Living in the USA\'\', Ronstadt conducted album promotional tours and concerts. She made a guest appearance onstage with [[the Rolling Stones]] at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where she and Jagger sang "Tumbling Dice".<ref>{{cite web | title= Ronstadt and Rolling Stones, July 21, 1978| work=Photos| url=http://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1,1222215,1222980|publisher=iorr.org forum | accessdate = December 9, 2010}}{{dubious|date=November 2012|reason=NON-RS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Rolling Stones U.S. Tour 1978 |date=July 21, 1978 | url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Rolling_Stones_U.S._Tour_1978.html0 |publisher=MyEtyomology.com/SpeedyLook| accessdate = December 9, 2010}}{{dubious|date=November 2012|reason=NON-RS}}</ref> On singing with Jagger, Ronstadt later said, "I loved it.

As \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine dubbed her "Rock\'s Venus",<ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/> her record sales continued to multiply and set records themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight gold, six platinum, and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the [[RIAA]] for seven-times platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over seven million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, \'\'[[Greatest Hits, Volume 2 (Linda Ronstadt album)|Greatest Hits, Volume 2]]\'\' was released and certified platinum.<ref name=RIAAsearch/>

In 1979, Ronstadt went on an international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]], and the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in Tokyo. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend [[Lowell George]], held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], in Los Angeles.

In 1980, Ronstadt released \'\'[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]\'\', her seventh consecutive platinum-selling album. It was a straightforward rock and roll album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, [[the Cretones]], and musician Mark Goldenberg who played on the record himself.

She also made the cover of \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine for a record-setting sixth time. \'\'Mad Love\'\' entered the \'\'Billboard\'\' Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the number 3 position.

The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to [[Pat Benatar]]\'s \'\'[[Crimes of Passion]]\'\' album).

In the summer of 1980, Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals.

\'\'The Pirates of Penzance\'\' opened for a limited engagement in New York City\'s [[Central Park]], eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.<ref name=imbd>{{cite web | publisher = [[Internet Broadway Database]] | title=Linda Ronstadt|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=58306| accessdate = May 8, 2007}}</ref> \'\'[[Newsweek]]\'\' was effusive in its praise: "... she has not dodged the [[coloratura]] demands of her role (and Mabel is one of the most demanding parts in the G&S canon): from her entrance trilling \'Poor Wand\'ring One,\' it is clear that she is prepared to scale whatever soprano peaks stand in her way."<ref name=bronson/> Ronstadt co-starred with Kline and [[Angela Lansbury]] in the 1983 operetta\'s film version.

As a child, Ronstadt had discovered the opera \'\'[[La boh\xc3\xa8me]]\'\' through the silent film with [[Lillian Gish]] and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the opera superstar [[Beverly Sills]], she was told, \'\'"My dear, \'\'every\'\' soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!"\'\' In 1984, Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp\'s [[Public Theater]].

In 1982, Ronstadt released the album \'\'[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]\'\', a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified platinum. It peaked at number 31 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with "Get Closer" and "[[I Knew You When]]"{{spaced ndash}} a 1965 hit by [[Billy Joe Royal]]{{spaced ndash}} while the Jimmy Webb song "Easy For You To Say" was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. "Sometimes You Just Can\'t Win" was picked up by country radio, and made it to number 27 on that listing. Rondstadt also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two Grammy Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], his second Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Package]].

Along with the release of her \'\'Get Closer\'\' album, Ronstadt embarked on a North American tour, remaining one of the top rock-concert draws that summer and fall.

Ronstadt\'s recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two are triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.<ref name="certifications"/>

By recording [[traditional pop]], [[Old-time music|traditional country]], [[Latin American music|traditional Latin roots]], and [[adult contemporary]], Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.

===Jazz/pop trilogy===
In 1981, Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of jazz and pop standards (later marketed in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] form) titled \'\'Keeping Out of Mischief\'\' with the assistance of producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. However, Ronstadt\'s displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. "Doing that killed me," she said in a \'\'Time\'\' magazine interview.<ref name="Time interview">{{cite news | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title=Linda Leads the Band | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833-2,00.html| accessdate = June 6, 2009 | date=September 26, 1983 | first1=Jay | last1=Cocks | first2=Denise | last2=Worrell}}</ref> But the appeal of the album\'s music had seduced Ronstadt, as she told \'\'[[Down Beat]]\'\' magazine in April 1985, crediting Wexler for encouraging her.<ref name="Jerry Wexler">{{cite web | work= [[Down Beat]] | title=An Intimate Conversation with Linda Ronstadt |first=Steve |last=Bloom | date=July 1985 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm| accessdate = August 18, 2008}}</ref> Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to somehow convince her reluctant record company, [[Elektra Records]], to [[greenlight]] this type of album under her contract.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle" />

By 1983, Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor and master of jazz/traditional pop orchestration [[Nelson Riddle]]. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]], recording a trilogy of [[jazz]]/ [[traditional pop]] albums: \'\'[[What\'s New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What\'s New]]\'\' (1983\xe2\x80\x94U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); \'\'[[Lush Life (Linda Ronstadt album)|Lush Life]]\'\' (1984\xe2\x80\x94U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and \'\'[[For Sentimental Reasons (Linda Ronstadt album)|For Sentimental Reasons]]\'\' (1986\xe2\x80\x94U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have had a combined sales total of nearly seven million copies in the U.S. alone.

The album design for \'\'What\'s New\'\' by designer [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]] was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a [[Walkman]] headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered "elevator music" by cynics, but remained determined to record with Riddle, and \'\'What\'s New\'\' became a hit. The album was released in September 1983 and spent 81 weeks on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Album Chart and held the number 3 position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot by [[Michael Jackson]]\'s \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\' and Lionel Richie\'s \'\'Can\'t Slow Down\'\') and the [[RIAA]] [[certified]] it triple platinum<ref name = RIAAsearch/> (over three million copies sold in the U.S. alone). The album earned Ronstadt another [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\' magazine calling it "one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year."<ref name="TimeWhatsNewReview">{{cite news |title=Music: Linda Leads the Band |date=September 26, 1983 |publisher = \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\' {{subscription required}}|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949833,00.html |archiveurl=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arttm83.htm |archivedate= August 8, 2008| deadurl=no |accessdate= September 29, 2007}}</ref>

Ronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record \'\'What\'s New\'\' or record with Riddle. According to [[jazz]] historian [[Peter Levinson]], author of the book \'\'September in the Rain{{spaced ndash}} a Biography on Nelson Riddle\'\', Joe Smith, president of [[Elektra Records]], was terrified that the Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt\'s rock audience.<ref name="lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle">{{cite web | work=Jerry Jazz Musician | title=The Peter Levinson Interview | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> Ronstadt did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured [[Danny Kortchmar]] as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.

\'\'What\'s New\'\' brought Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, "the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with [[Frank Sinatra]],<ref name=nelsonriddle>{{cite web | title=Peter Levinson (Interview) | publisher=jerryjazzmusician.com | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = June 14, 2007}}</ref> which in 1983 was considered \'Vintage Pop\'". Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life.<ref name=nelsonriddle/> [[Stephen Holden]] of \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\' wrote, \'\'What\'s New\'\' "isn\'t the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.&nbsp;... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print."<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | newspaper= [[The New York Times]] | title=Linda Ronstadt Celebrate the Golden Age of Pop | author = [[Stephen Holden|Holden, Stephen]] | date=September 4, 1983 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html | accessdate = May 10, 2007| date=February 7, 2005}}</ref> \'\'What\'s New\'\' is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]].<ref name=nytimes/>

In 1984, Ronstadt and Riddle performed these songs live, in [[concert halls]] throughout Australia, Japan, and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Radio City Music Hall]], and [[Pine Knob]].

In 2004, Ronstadt released \'\'[[Hummin\' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin\' to Myself]]\'\', her album for [[Verve Records]]. It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard\'s Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music]] gave her, \'\'Hummin\' To Myself\'\' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.<ref name="JazzTimes2"/>

===="Trio" recordings====
{{Quote box

|quote="When (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I\'ve never heard before. We (recorded the vocals) as individual parts, because we didn\'t have the luxury of spending a lot of time together on a tour bus ... and knowing each other\'s (vocal) moves ... takes years."|source=\xe2\x80\x94Linda Ronstadt<ref name=MIXMag2000/>}}
In 1978, Ronstadt, [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Emmylou Harris]], friends and admirers of one another\'s work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton\'s "[[I Will Always Love You]]" on \'\'Prisoner in Disguise\'\') attempted to collaborate on a \'\'Trio\'\' album. Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers\' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.

In January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, \'\'[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]\'\', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard\'s Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, it produced four Top Ten Country singles including "To Know Him Is To Love Him" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, U2, Prince, and Whitney Houston.

In 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to \'\'Trio\'\'. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album\'s release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{spaced ndash}} and owed her record company a finished album{{spaced ndash}} removed Parton\'s individual tracks at Parton\'s request, kept Harris\'s vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album \'\'Feels Like Home\'\'.

However, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the \'\'[[Trio II]]\'\' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of [[Neil Young]]\'s "After The Gold Rush" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three ladies also received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Album.

====\'\'Canciones\'\'{{spaced ndash}} songs of the Ronstadt family====
At the end of 1987, Ronstadt released \'\'[[Canciones de Mi Padre]]\'\', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as "world class songs".  Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rub\xc3\xa9n Fuentes]].

These \'\'canciones\'\' were a big part of Ronstadt\'s family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled \'\'Canciones de mi Padre\'\'.<ref name=MyFathersSongs>{{cite web | work=Tucson\'sRonstadtFamily | title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre - A Musical Family |first=James S. |last=Griffith | url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html | accessdate = May 30, 2007}}</ref> Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt\'s aunt, was herself an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel\'s father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda\'s grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt\'s booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible Anglo accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.<ref name=MexAm>{{cite web | title=American Way | work=Linda Ronstadt\'s New Old Flame- Mexican Music| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm| accessdate = May 7, 2007}}</ref> Her formative years were spent with her father\'s side of the family.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Herbst |work= [[Rolling Stone]] |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |accessdate = October 19, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archivedate = October 22, 2006}}</ref> In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, \'\'"Lo siento mi vida"\'\'{{spaced ndash}} a song that she included in her Grammy Award-winning album \'\'[[Hasten Down the Wind]]\'\'. Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltr\xc3\xa1n]] as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo "Lalo" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.<ref name="AARP-07"/>

This album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc\'s [[RIAA]] double-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over two million copies sold in the U.S.) certification, making it the biggest-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show, served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.

Ronstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on Broadway. She called the stage show by the same name \'\'Canciones de mi Padre\'\'. These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in \'\'La boh\xc3\xa8me\'\', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]\'s \'\'Great Performances\'\' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].

Ronstadt later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s; their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, where she appeared to do the "bare minimum" to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as \'\'Canciones De Mi Padre\'\', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released \'\'[[Mas Canciones]]\'\', a follow-up to the first \'\'Canciones\'\'. For this effort she won a [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well known "afro-Cuban" songs. This disc was titled \'\'[[Frenes\xc3\xad (album)|Frenes\xc3\xad]]\'\'. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy Award, this time the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].

In 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in \'\'La Pastorela\'\', or \'\'A Shephard\'s Tale\'\', a musical filmed at \'\'San Juan Bautista\'\'. It was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The production was part of the PBS \'\'Great Performances\'\' series.

====Returning to the contemporary music scene====
By the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 singles chart with "[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]", which peaked at number 2 in March.<ref name=bronson/> Featured in the animated film \'\'[[An American Tail]]\'\', the sentimental duet with [[James Ingram]] was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.{{spaced ndash}} one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled \'\'[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]\'\', which was titled "Dreams To Dream". Although "Dreams To Dream" failed to achieve the success of "Somewhere Out There", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.

In 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. This effort, titled \'\'[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]\'\', became one of the singer\'s most successful albums{{spaced ndash}} in terms of production, arrangements, chart sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt\'s tenth Top 10 album on the \'\'Billboard\'\' chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch/> (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also garnered critical acclaim, receiving numerous Grammy Award nominations and being praised by [[Amazon.com]] as "an album that defines virtually everything that is right about adult contemporary pop."<ref name=CryReview>{{cite web |title=\'\'Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind\'\' Editorial Review | publisher= [[Amazon.com]] |first=Daniel |last=Durchholz |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002H7E | accessdate = July 10, 2008}}</ref> Ronstadt featured New Orleans soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the album\'s songs.

Ronstadt incorporated the sounds of the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]], [[Tower of Power]] horns, the [[Skywalker Symphony]], and numerous musicians. It had the duets with Aaron Neville, "[[Don\'t Know Much]]" (\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989<ref name=bronson/>) and "[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]" (\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt\'s last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed "Don\'t Know Much" together on the telecast.<ref name=kqed/> ("Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can\'t do by myself", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. "I can do things with Aaron that I can\'t do alone.")<ref>Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). "Home Grown". \'\'[[The Times-Picayune]]\'\'.</ref>

In December 1990, she participated in a concert held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] to commemorate [[John Lennon]]\'s 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included [[Miles Davis]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Sean Lennon]]. An album resulted, titled \'\'Happy Birthday, John\'\'.<ref name=Lennon>{{cite web | title=John Lennon Super Live -- Japan | work=Dream Power |first=Hisataka |last=Suzuki |first2=Shiona |last2=MacKenzie |date=November 9, 2001 | url=http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/dreampower2001.html | accessdate = May 12, 2007}}</ref>

===A return to roots music===
Continuing with her crafted approach to more mainstream-oriented material, Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed \'\'[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]\'\' album at the end of 1993. It includes New Age arrangements such as the lead single "Heartbeats Accelerating" as well as the self-penned title track and features the unique glass harmonica instrument. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995\'s \'\'[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]\'\' was Ronstadt\'s much heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]\'s classic hit "[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]". The single\'s rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, "Walk On", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled "The Blue Train" charted 10 weeks in \'\'Billboard\'\'\'s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song "Perfidia" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.<ref name="billboardmag">

In 1996, Ronstadt produced \'\'[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]\'\', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in \'\'Billboard\'\' and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].

In 1998, Ronstadt released \'\'[[We Ran]]\'\', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt\'s country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock \'n\' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stands{{spaced ndash}} at 60,000 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008{{spaced ndash}} as the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt\'s Elektra/Asylum catalog. \'\'We Ran\'\' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.

Despite the lack of success of \'\'We Ran\'\', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album \'\'[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]\'\', a folk-rock-oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of \'\'Billboard\'\'\'s Country Albums chart (number 73 on the main \'\'Billboard\'\' album chart). However, it would sell roughly half the number of copies that \'\'[[Trio II]]\'\' sold and had gone out of print as of December 2010.

Also in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Jackson Browne]] at [[Staples Center]]\'s 1999 New Year\'s Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, "It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century", and "Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year\'s Eve in Los Angeles."<ref name=NewYearsEve>{{cite web |title=The Eagles to Perform at Staples Center |date=May 6, 1999 |publisher=Staples Center |url=http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928135754/http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&itype=&iCategoryID=0  |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |accessdate = November 25, 2012}}</ref>

In 2000, Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the [[Elektra Records|Elektra/Asylum label]]. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of \'\'[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]\'\', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song "River", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney\'s signature song, "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]".

Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]].

In 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her new friend, musician and musical scholar [[Ann Savoy]], to record \'\'[[Adieu False Heart]]\'\'. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But \'\'[[Adieu False Heart]]\'\' was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as the result of Parkinson\'s disease, diagnosed in December 2012. \'\'Adieu False Heart\'\', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of the Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell, and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush, and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

In 2007, Ronstadt could be heard on the compilation album \'\'[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]\'\'{{spaced ndash}} a tribute album to jazz music\'s all-time most heralded artist{{spaced ndash}} on the track "Miss Otis Regrets".<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Linda Ronstadt] Rock on the Net.</ref>

In the summer of 2007, Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this event, where she incorporated jazz, rock, and folk music into her repertoire. It was one of her final concerts.

After living in Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco because she said she never felt at home in Southern California.<ref name=SFGateSale/> "Los Angeles became too enclosing an environment," she says. "I couldn\'t breathe the air, and I didn\'t want to drive on the freeways to get to the studio. I also didn\'t want to embrace the values that have been so completely embraced by that city.

The incident prompted international headlines and debate on an entertainer\'s right to express a political opinion from the stage, and made the editorial section of \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\'.<ref name=Desperadoes>{{cite news |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]| title=Desperadoes | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/opinion/21wed4.html | date=July 21, 2004 | accessdate = May 12, 2007}}</ref> Following the incident, many friends of Ronstadt\'s, including the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], immediately cancelled their engagements at the Aladdin.<ref name=kqed/> Ronstadt also received telegrams of support from her rock \'n\' roll friends around the world, such as [[the Rolling Stones]], the Eagles, and [[Elton John]]. Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued in her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America.

At a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the \'\'[[Calgary Sun]]\'\' that she was "embarrassed [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] (was) from the United States.&nbsp;... He\'s an idiot.... He\'s enormously incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes.&nbsp;... Now the fact that we were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have died \xe2\x80\x93 it\'s just as immoral as racism." Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident by noting, "If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone ... you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful.

In August 2009, Ronstadt, in a well-publicized interview to [[Planet Out|PlanetOut Inc.]] titled "Linda Ronstadt\'s Gay Mission", championed gay rights and same-sex marriage and stated that "homophobia is anti-family values.

\'\'\'Darius Carlos Rucker\'\'\' (born May 13, 1966) is an American musician. He first gained fame as the [[lead singer]] and [[rhythm guitar]]ist of the [[Grammy Award]]-winning [[rock music|rock]] band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], which he founded in 1986 at the [[University of South Carolina]] along with [[Mark Bryan]], [[Jim Sonefeld|Jim "Soni" Sonefeld]] and Dean Felber. The band has released five studio albums with him as a member, and charted six top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. Rucker co-wrote the majority of the band\'s songs with the other three members.

He released a solo [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] album, \'\'[[Back to Then]]\'\', in 2002 on [[Hidden Beach Recordings]] but did not chart any singles from it. Six years later, Rucker signed to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville as a [[country music]] artist, releasing the album \'\'[[Learn to Live]]\'\' that year.

Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name=Kennedy/> With Rucker\'s recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities.

\'\'\'Sugarland\'\'\', an [[United States of America|American]] [[country music]] duo, is composed of singer, songwriters and actors [[Jennifer Nettles]] (lead vocals) and [[Kristian Bush]] (background vocals, lead vocals,  [[mandolin]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], and [[harmonica]]). Sugarland was founded in 2002 by [[Kristen Hall]] with Bush and became a trio after hiring Jennifer Nettles as [[lead singer]].<ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/sugarland/bio.jhtml |title=Artist biography: Sugarland |publisher=[[Country Music Television|CMT]] |accessdate=2008-09-03 }}</ref> After three years, Hall left the group.

Signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2004, Sugarland broke through that year with the release of their debut single "[[Baby Girl (Sugarland song)|Baby Girl]]", the first single from their multi-platinum debut album \'\'[[Twice the Speed of Life]]\'\'. The trio became a duo in 2006, when they also released their second album, \'\'[[Enjoy the Ride (Sugarland album)|Enjoy the Ride]]\'\'. This album produced their first two No.&nbsp;1 singles (in the U.S.), "[[Want To]]" and "[[Settlin\']]", and won the duo a Grammy for "[[Stay (Sugarland song)|Stay]]". In 2008 they released their third album, titled \'\'[[Love on the Inside]]\'\'. This album produced three more No.&nbsp;1 singles with "[[All I Want to Do]]", "[[Already Gone (Sugarland song)|Already Gone]]", and "[[It Happens]]". Their fourth album, \'\'[[The Incredible Machine (album)|The Incredible Machine]]\'\' was released on October 19, 2010 in both a standard and deluxe edition. Upon \'\'The Incredible Machine\'\' being certified platinum, Sugarland has sold in excess of 14 million records.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.theboot.com/2011/01/31/sugarland-incredible-machine-platinum-sales/ | title =Sugarland Strikes Platinum With Their "Incredible Machine" | author =Cory Stromblad | date =31 January 2011 | publisher =The Boot | accessdate = 31 January 2011}}</ref> Besides songs written with Kevin Griffin, Nettles and Bush write all of the band\'s songs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sugarland Red Dirt Road|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96pDt53eAk4|work=Youtube|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> In 2012, after recording a series of tours, the duo went on hiatus due in part to Nettles taking a maternity leave; during the hiatus, both she and Bush recorded solo projects.

===2004\xe2\x80\x932005, \'\'Twice the Speed of Life\'\'===
{{Expand section|More biographical info, critical reception, musical stylings|date=December 2008}}
Jennifer Nettles grew up in the small town of [[Douglas, Georgia]]. Nettles, Bush, and Hall were regulars in Atlanta\'s [[folk-rock]] scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at [[Eddie\'s Attic]] in [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia, which Nettles\' ex-husband owned for a time.

Sugarland\'s debut album, \'\'[[Twice the Speed of Life]]\'\', was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song "[[Baby Girl (Sugarland song)|Baby Girl]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles "Something More", "Just Might (Make Me Believe)", and "Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good)", which peaked on the country charts at No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;7, and No.&nbsp;17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with [[Bon Jovi]] on [[Country Music Television]]\'s musical fusion show, \'\'[[Crossroads (CMT TV series)|Crossroads]]\'\'. Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single "[[Who Says You Can\'t Go Home]]". The song later went on to become a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the country charts.

==Biography==
Michael and Bill grew up in [[Newberry, South Carolina]], where they began writing songs at the age of 15. Every summer, Bill\'s cousin, Graham, joined the duo and they would perform together. A friend eventually introduced Zach, and A Thousand Horses was formed. The name "A Thousand Horses" came from a song off of their debut album.<ref name="10questions">10 Questions With A Thousand Horses http://focusonthe615.com/2012/02/09/10-questions-with-a-thousand-horses/.. Retrieved January 22,2015.</ref> All of the band members enjoy writing their original new songs, but they occasionally collaborate with other writers around Nashville. The band has toured nationwide and has plans to continue with their new album, "Southernality."

Certified platinum in the US, it produced his first Number One on [[Hot Country Songs]] with "[[But for the Grace of God]]". "[[Somebody Like You]]", the first single from his second Capitol album, \'\'[[Golden Road (album)|Golden Road]]\'\' (2002), was named by \'\'Billboard\'\' as the biggest country hit of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]].

In September 2013, he released a brand new album titled \'\'[[Fuse (Keith Urban album)|Fuse]]\'\', which produced three more number ones on the newly introduced [[Country Airplay]] chart.

Urban has released a total of nine studio albums (one of which was released only in the United Kingdom), as well as one album with The Ranch. He has charted 31 singles on the US country charts, of which 17 have reached Number One (counting a [[Start a Band|duet with]] [[Brad Paisley]] and the 2008 single "[[You Look Good in My Shirt]]", which Keith Urban himself previously recorded on \'\'Golden Road\'\').

He won Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards and the 2001 [[Country Music Association]]\'s Horizon Award. [[Allmusic]]\'s Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track "Rollercoaster" by saying that Urban was "flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with." He thought that those songs "balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/keith-urban-mw0000252646|title=\'\'Keith Urban\'\' review|last=Jurek|first=Thom|work=Allmusic|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

The song was released on the radio at the end of May. "Over the years it ("You Look Good In My Shirt") has always played like a hit song," said Keith. "That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song." The single was a precursor to the "Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour" concert DVD release in the Fall of \'08. In late 2008, Urban was featured on [[Brad Paisley]]\'s single "[[Start a Band]]", on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar.

Urban\'s 2009 Escape Together tour, supporting the album, \'\'[[Defying Gravity (Keith Urban album)|Defying Gravity]]\'\', featured many big name opening acts, including [[Taylor Swift]], [[Sugarland]], and [[Jason Aldean]]. On 27 June 2009 Keith filmed a video for the song, "Only You Can Love Me This Way", at the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.

[[File:2013 Golden Globe Awards (8378775681).jpg|thumb|left|Urban with wife Nicole Kidman at the [[2013 Golden Globes|70th Golden Globe Awards]]]]
Urban met American-born Australian actress [[Nicole Kidman]] at \'\'G\'Day LA\'\', a Hollywood event honoring Australians, in January 2005, but they reportedly did not begin dating until six months later. Kidman and Urban were married on Sunday, 25 June 2006, at the Cardinal Cerretti Memorial Chapel in the grounds of St Patrick\'s Estate, [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in Sydney.

In Nashville, Urban had become a frequent user of [[cocaine]].<ref>[http://www.usaweekend.com/01_issues/011104/011104urban.html "Up from Down Under"] by Stephanie Mansfield, \'\'[[USA WEEKEND]]\'\', 8 November 2001</ref> After reaching a personal nadir in 1998, he became determined to give up the habit and checked into Cumberland Heights, a treatment center in Nashville.

On 19 October 2006, Urban checked himself into the [[Betty Ford Center]] in California. On 20 October, Urban issued a statement saying: "I deeply regret the hurt this has caused Nicole and the ones who love and support me. One can never let one\'s guard down on recovery, and I\'m afraid that I have." On 18 January 2007, Urban announced his completion of rehab and his plans to go on tour to promote his new album, \'\'[[Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6270247.stm |work=BBC News  |title=Singer Urban ends rehab treatment | date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

On 2 February 2007, Urban filed a lawsuit against a New Jersey painter by the same name, who has a web site called KeithUrban.com. The singer wanted to acquire the rights to the URL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3if477e99d5c9afc6cb34884b6b1867e96 |title=Keith Urban sues Keith Urban over web site |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=7 February 2007 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> Keith Urban the singer\'s URL is keithurban.net.

On 1 October 2007, while riding, Urban skidded off his [[motorbike]] when a [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] followed him near his home in Sydney; Urban was not hurt. In a statement released by his publicists, Urban said that the incident was "the result of one person\'s desire to do his job and my desire to maintain my privacy". Urban said that he tried to avoid an oncoming car and dropped his bike. He said the photographer came to his assistance without taking photos.

On 7 January 2008, Nicole Kidman confirmed she and Urban were expecting their first child together. Kidman\'s publicist said "the couple are thrilled and cannot wait". Kidman gave birth to daughter Sunday Rose Kidman Urban in 2008 in Nashville, Tennessee. On his website, Urban stated:

<blockquote>
"Earlier this morning Nic gave birth to our beautiful baby girl, Sunday Rose Kidman Urban. We want to thank everybody that has kept us in their thoughts and prayers. We feel very, very blessed and grateful that we can share this joy with all of my loving fans today."<ref>[http://www.keithurban.net/content/news_article.php?em1934=191697_-1__0_~0_-1_7_2008_0_0&content=news&em1975= Keith Urban.net | Keith Welcomes Sunday Rose Kidman Urban!]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7497137.stm |work=BBC News  |title=Kidman\'s baby name mystery solved |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2010, Urban and Kidman had a second daughter, Faith Margaret Kidman Urban, via surrogate at Nashville\'s Centennial Women\'s Hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20458381,00.html|title=Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Welcome a Daughter!|work=People |date=17 January 2011}}</ref> On 17 January 2011, Urban posted this statement on his website:

No words can adequately convey the incredible gratitude that we feel for everyone who was so supportive throughout this process, in particular our gestational carrier."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keithurban.net/news.html?n_id=46181|date=17 January 2011|publisher=Keith Urban|title= New News Today!}}</ref> Faith\'s middle name is after Kidman\'s late grandmother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20458718,00.html|title=Nicole Kidman & Keith Urban: \'Blessed\' by Faith|work=People |date=19 January 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early years ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Brown was born Zachry Alexander Brown<ref name=BMIDATA>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?page=1&blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&fromrow=1&torow=25&affiliation=SESAC&cae=480875717&keyID=984990&keyname=BROWN%20ZACHRY%20ALEXANDER&querytype=WriterID|title=Songwriter/Composer: BROWN ZACHRY ALEXANDER|last=Brown|first=Zachry Alexander|publisher=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] (BMI)|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> on August 1, 1978, in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. He was raised on Lake Lanier by his mother and stepfather, a  dentist in [[Cumming, Georgia]]. The 11th of 12 children, Brown attended Mashburn Elementary School in Cumming; Lakeview Academy in [[Gainesville, Georgia]]; and [[South Forsyth High School]] in Cumming. He later moved to Dahlonega, Georgia, at age 17, where he graduated from [[Lumpkin County High School]].

Brown was given his mother\'s guitar at age 8, and one of his stepfather\'s patients was enlisted to teach him classical guitar. He completed two years of lessons, but soon after developed a love for [[bluegrass music]] while playing with his father and brother on weekend visits. In his mid-teens, Brown spent almost a year being tutored by a vocal coach from his church in Cumming.

While still in high school, with [[James Taylor]] as his inspiration, Brown began playing solo gigs in local venues, performing country and pop [[cover version|cover]] songs. Brown attended the [[University of West Georgia]], where he became a member of the Zeta Kappa chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Order]] fraternity. He was also a camp counselor at [[Camp Mikell]] in Toccoa, Georgia, and Camp Glisson, a United Methodist summer camp and retreat center located in Dahlonega, Georgia.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Alumni News| publisher = The Kappa Alpha Order Journal| date = Summer 2007 }}</ref> By the age of 19, he began touring the Southeast of the U.S. with a drummer and his dog, Pete, laying the foundation of what would become the Zac Brown Band nine years later.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ben-Yehuda|first=Ayala|title=Music: Happening Now - Zac Attack|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=Oct 25, 2008|volume=120|issue=43|page=36|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1020474?accountid=8360|accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Formation ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
In 2002, Brown was traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year. The initial Zac Brown lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by a drummer and a bass guitarist. In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown\xe2\x80\x94it was later renamed "Southern Ground" for legal reasons.

In 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia, called "Zac\'s Place" where the fare was southern-style cooking. A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs, as well as folk and jam band festivals. The release of the Zac Brown Band\'s first independent album, \'\'Home Grown\'\', occurred during the same year.

Also in 2004, Brown added violinist/fiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the lineup. According to an interview with De Martini, he explained that [[John Driskell Hopkins]], Brown\'s frequent songwriting collaborator, was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]], at the time, where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed. Durette suggested De Martini to Brown, who was wanting a "lead instrument" in his band, as well as a harmony singer. After doing several performances with the band at the club, Brown asked De Martini to become a permanent member, to which De Martini gladly obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenville.metromix.com/music/article/q-and-a-jimmy/1470971/content|title=Q&A: Jimmy DeMartini of Zac Brown Band|author=Matt Wake|publisher=Metromix Greenville|date=2009-09-17|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>

Brown met Hopkins in 1998 when Hopkins was hosting an open mic night at CJ\'s Landing in Buckhead, Georgia. Hopkins later recorded \'\'Home Grown\'\' in his music studio, Brighter Shade Studios. The two remained friends, and in 2005, Hopkins stepped in as bass guitarist while helping the group finish what would become their number-one single "Toes." "Toes" was the second single from the band\'s major-label debut, \'\'[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]\'\', which was partially recorded in Hopkins\' studio. \'\'[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]\'\' was also partially recorded in Brighter Shade Studios.

Bowles transferred to Atlanta\'s [[Georgia State University]] to study music. He subsequently became involved in Atlanta\'s various music scenes, and eventually formed Coy Bowles and the Fellowship in 2004. Two years later, Bowles decided to reconnect with Brown. Through mutual friends, he learned that the Zac Brown Band was scheduled to perform in Atlanta one evening. Bowles and Brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other, which ended with Brown inviting Bowles to sit in with his band at that night\'s performance. To return the favor, Bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the Fellowship a couple of months later, which in turn resulted in Brown and his band sitting in at that gig.

This turn of events continued for eight months until Bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with Brown\'s band and his own band, in addition to other activities; he therefore made a decision to put the Fellowship on an indefinite hiatus, and became a permanent member of the Zac Brown Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/music/about-zbb/|title=About ZBB \xe2\x80\x93 Coy Bowles|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/coy/about/|title=About << Coy Bowles|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>

In 2008, the Zac Brown Band signed to Live Nation Artists Records, in association with Brown\'s own Home Grown label, after Chris Fryar became an addition to the band. An [[Alabama]] native, Fryar attended the [[University of North Texas]] and the [[Mississippi University for Women]], and made a name for himself in the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2011/05/and_the_beat_goes_on_gardendal.html|title=The beat goes on: Gardendale drummer Chris Fryar earns fame, stays humble in Zac Brown Band (video)|author=Mary Colurso|publisher=The Birmingham News|date=2011-05-27|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref> According to Fryar, a mutual friend recommended him to Brown, who was in need of a new drummer for the band. Fryar, who in turn had just finished a stint with a previous band, subsequently auditioned and shortly afterward became the Zac Brown Band\'s newest member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/static/ads/landing_pages/4343_zacbrownband/4343_landing_page.html|title=Landshark Lager - Proud Sponsor of Zac Brown Band|accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref>

In 2014, with the addition of bassist Matt Mangano to the line-up, Hopkins traded in his bass to take on the role of multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, ukulele, stand-up bass, and banjo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zacbrownband.com/john-driskell-hopkins.html |title=John Driskell Hopkins |publisher=Zac Brown Band |date= |accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref>

===Commercial success===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
The Zac Brown Band\'s debut single, "[[Chicken Fried]]", was originally recorded in 2003 and included on the \'\'Home Grown\'\' album, but later re-recorded and released to country radio in 2008. This song was also recorded by [[The Lost Trailers]], whose 2006 recording was released as a single but withdrawn after Brown decided that he wanted to release it himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4477828-1.html |title= BNA Forced To Swap Trailers\' Single |accessdate=2008-06-19 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2006-03-15 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref> Brown also co-wrote "Simple Life", a song recorded by The Lost Trailers on their 2006 [[The Lost Trailers (album)|self-titled album]].

In the third episode of HBO\'s music documentary series [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|Sonic Highways]], Brown was a featured interviewee and explained why Lost Trailer\'s version of "Chicken Fried" was pulled from the radio. Brown stated that after 6 years of touring that he was broke and sleeping in his tour van. In 2005 the Lost Trailers contacted Brown and expressed interest in recording "Chicken Fried". Brown stated he agreed under the condition that the song would only be an album cut and not a single as he still had hopes of releasing the song as a radio single himself.

Both parties agreed and the Lost Trailers recorded the song. Some months later the Lost Trailers landed a deal with Sony Nashville, and when they submitted the tracks for their album, they included "Chicken Fried". Joe Galante, then the Chairman of Sony Music Nashville, heard the tracks and chose "Chicken Fried" as the single that the label wanted to promote.

Brown described hearing his song on the radio: "The first time I hear \'Chicken Fried\' on the radio and it wasn\'t us singing it. It was a nightmare." Brown then called his lawyer to have the song pulled from the radio immediately. Brown\'s lawyer warned him that because of Galante\'s power in the Nashville music scene that pulling the song could essentially have him blackballed in Nashville. Brown was insistent that his agreement with the Lost Trailers was violated, so his lawyer issued a [[cease and desist]] letter and the single was pulled from the radio.

A few months later The Zac Brown Band was booked to perform at 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville and producer [[Keith Stegall]] came to watch their performance. Stegall and Brown had drinks later that night and Brown recalled Stegall stating, "I just had to meet the kid that told Joe Galante to fuck off!" Brown credits this incident and his meeting and collaboration with Stegall as the beginning of his success in the music business.

In October 2008, [[Atlantic Records]] acquired distribution of "Chicken Fried" after Live Nation Artists closed.

On January 7, 2013, Zac Brown Band performed the National Anthem at the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]] between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Just two weeks later on January 20, 2013, the band performed the National Anthem during the NFC Championship Game between the Atlanta Falcons and the San Francisco 49ers at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.

On January 1, 2014, Zac Brown Band performed the National Anthem during the NHL\'s Winter Classic between the [[Detroit Red Wings]] & [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] at [[Michigan Stadium]] in Ann Arbor, Michigan, home of the [[Michigan Wolverines]] football team.

The Zac Brown Band announced on January 12, 2015, that it had finalized a four-way strategic partnership involving the Southern Ground Artists record label, Big Machine Label Group, Republic Records, and John Varvatos Records for the release of its fourth studio album. The terms of the deal state that the Zac Brown Band will work with Big Machine Label Group for marketing and distribution, while Southern Ground Artists will work on radio promotion, Republic will provide support in the area of non-country radio formats and international promotion, and Varvatos will oversee branding and styling.<ref name="Zac">{{cite web|author1=Nate Rau|title=Zac Brown Band aligns with Big Machine|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2015/01/12/zac-brown-band-aligns-big-machine/21649505/|website=The Tennessean|publisher=The Tennessean|accessdate=17 January 2015|date=12 January 2015}}</ref> Brown stated in a press release:

=== Inclusion of Clay Cook ===
In January 2009, two months after "Chicken Fried" went to No.&nbsp;1, Atlanta native Clay Cook joined the Zac Brown Band as its multi-instrumentalist and high tenor vocalist. Cook had previously collaborated with [[John Mayer]] and [[Shawn Mullins]], and was also a member of the [[The Marshall Tucker Band|Marshall Tucker Band]] for two years prior to joining the Zac Brown Band. According to Cook, he and Brown actually both attended and graduated from high school together, but were never acquainted with each other during that period.
He explains how he first met Brown:
{{quote|We ran into each other (in) 2003 in a club scene in Atlanta, where I think my band opened up for his band...ever since then, we\'ve been friendly...and I think he just thought I was a singer-songwriter for a long time; and then we were on a (music) cruise ship together...and I was playing with the Marshall Tucker Band at the time, and (Brown)\'s band (also participated in the cruise)...and he actually got to see me play the guitar...and then he realized, \'I need this guy in my band,\' I guess.<ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj69DZ-FHTE|title=ExploreMusic chats with Clay Cook|publisher=YouTube|date=2010-12-10|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>}}

Brown himself admitted his strong desire to add Cook to the lineup, for he believed Cook\'s musicianship would enhance the Zac Brown Band\'s overall musical style:

{{quote|I\xe2\x80\x99d been tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to get him in the band for three years, and you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a journey, but I always knew [he could make us better]. I\xe2\x80\x99m a harmony fanatic. I love big harmonies and things, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a high tenor, and Jimmy [De Martini], my fiddle player, sings a lot of the high stuff now, but havin\xe2\x80\x99 somebody that can actually sing on top of that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve added a four-part harmony now that\xe2\x80\x99s searing, and the guy\xe2\x80\x99s a monster player, too."<ref name=gactv.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5942665,00.html|title=Zac Brown Band Expands On \'\'The Foundation\'\'|publisher=GAC News|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2011-11-23}}</ref>}}

With the new Zac Brown Band lineup completed, the band released its second single, "[[Whatever It Is]]," which went to No.&nbsp;2. In October 2009, a third single, "[[Toes (Zac Brown Band song)|Toes]]," became the band\'s second Number One. The album\'s fourth single, and third No.&nbsp;1, was "[[Highway 20 Ride]]".

De los Reyes had previously performed with the band as a touring musician and participated in the recording of their album \'\'[[Uncaged]]\'\'. De los Reyes has also performed with artists and groups such as [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/zac-brown-talks-new-album-uncaged-out-july-10-new-band-member-and-search-for-that-pulse/2012/04/25/gIQA0wYKgT_story.html|title=Zac Brown talks new album \xe2\x80\x98Uncaged,\xe2\x80\x99 out July 10, new band member and search for \xe2\x80\x98that pulse\xe2\x80\x99|publisher=Washington Post|date=2012-04-25|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> "[[Goodbye in Her Eyes]]" reached Number One on the [[Country Airplay]] chart in 2013.

\'\'\'Buffalo Springfield\'\'\' was an American-Canadian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1966 whose members included [[Richie Furay]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Neil Young]], [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], [[Bruce Palmer]], [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], [[Ken Koblun]], and [[Jim Fielder]] which combined [[Rock music|rock]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[country music|country]] music. The band released the classic 1960s protest song "[[For What It\'s Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It\'s Worth]]."

The band was plagued by infighting, drug-related arrests, and line-up changes that led to its disbanding after two years. Three albums were released under its name, but many [[demo (music)|demos]], studio [[outtake]]s, and live recordings remained and were issued in the decades that followed.<ref name="Einarson Furay 2004" />

They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Neil Young and Stephen Stills first crossed paths in 1965 at the Fourth Dimension in [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]]. Young was there with [[The Squires (Canadian band)|The Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|The Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. Although the two did not see each other again for almost a year, the encounter left both with a strong desire to work together.

When The Company broke up at the end of that tour, Stills moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[studio musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other things, [[The Monkees]].<ref name="Prown Newquist 1997" /> He had been in a band called Buffalo Fish with fellow Greenwich Village transplant [[Peter Tork]], who encouraged him to audition.

Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] that there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3\'s a Crowd (band)|3\'s a Crowd]].

In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the [[Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews (later known as [[Rick James]]) was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL. With their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer decided to head for Los Angeles where they hoped to encounter Stills.

Roughly a week later, discouraged at having been unable to locate Stills and ready to depart for [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], they were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Los Angeles when Stills, Furay and Friedman, sitting in their white van, recognized Young\'s black 1953 Pontiac hearse, which happened to be passing by in the opposite direction. After an illegal u-turn by Furay, some shouting, hand-waving, and much excitement, the four musicians realized that they were united in their determination to put together a band. Drummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group the [[Standells]] and [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[The Dillards]], was added to the roster less than a week later after contacting the group at the suggestion of the [[Byrds]]\' manager, Jim Dickson.

The group\'s name was taken from the side of a [[steamroller]], made by the Springfield, Ohio-based Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company (now part of [[BOMAG]]<ref>{{cite web|title=A brief history of BOMAG Americas, Inc.|url=http://www.bomag.com/us/en/company.htm|website=Bomag Fayat Group}}</ref>), that had been parked on the street outside Friedman\'s house where Stills and Furay were staying at the time. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act on a bill featuring [[The Dillards]] and [[The Byrds]].

=== Management and first recordings ===
No sooner had The Byrds\' tour ended than [[Chris Hillman]] persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give the band an audition. Buffalo Springfield essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band\'s reputation for exhilarating live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis, who had been lighting manager for The Byrds, to become involved in the group\'s management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]\'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers.  Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group\'s tour manager. Greene and Stone eventually struck a deal with [[Ahmet Erteg\xc3\xbcn]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.

Young, Stills and Furay all recorded demos for the album, but Greene and Stone, who had installed themselves as the album\'s [[record producers|producers]], deemed Young\'s voice "too weird" and assigned lead vocals on the majority of Young\'s songs to Furay.  However, none of Furay\'s own original compositions were deemed strong enough for the album, although several were worked on during the sessions.

The first Buffalo Springfield single, \xe2\x80\x9cNowadays Clancy Can\xe2\x80\x99t Even Sing\xe2\x80\x9d, was released in August but made little impact outside of Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. The group was dissatisfied with and reworked some of their early recording efforts for the rest of the album. In fact, Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[stereophonic|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The album, eponymously titled \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield (album)|Buffalo Springfield]],\'\' was originally released by Atlantic\'s subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version (see below) issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order, came in March 1967.

In November 1966 Stills composed his landmark song, [[For What It\'s Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|"For What It\'s Worth"]], after police actions against the crowds of young people who had gathered on the [[Sunset Strip]] to protest the closing of a nightclub called [[Pandora\'s Box (nightclub)|Pandora\'s Box]] (contrary to later retellings by Stills, he was not present for the riot; rather, Buffalo Springfield was playing an engagement in San Francisco at the time). The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterward. By March 1967 it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song "Baby Don\'t Scold Me" with "For What It\'s Worth" and re-releasing the album. "For What It\'s Worth" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="Murrells 1978" />

=== Lineup changes ===
In January 1967 the group took an advance from the record company and flew to New York to perform at Ondine\'s, a club where [[The Doors]] would also play. It was at this time that Palmer was first arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and summarily deported back to Canada.

The band moved back and forth between recording sessions and live appearances on both coasts. A number of different bassists were used, such as Mike Barnes and [[Jim Fielder]] of [[The Mothers of Invention]]. In one instance \xe2\x80\x93 a live performance on the television show \'\'[[Hollywood Palace]]\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 Springfield\'s road manager, who couldn\'t play bass, held a bass with his back to the camera while the band mimed to a prerecorded track. An appearance on the [[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]] was taped on February 17, 1967, airing on February 26.<ref name="Smothers Brothers" />

Under these conditions work on the new album, tentatively titled \'\'Stampede\'\', was markedly tense. Ever distrustful of Greene and Stone, Young and Stills also bickered between themselves, and each insisted on producing the recording sessions for his own compositions. Furay, who had sung and played guitar on the first album but had not contributed any songs, also stepped forward and equaled Young\'s number for the group\'s second album.

Although Palmer returned to the group at the beginning of June, Young had already left and as a result missed the celebrated [[Monterey Pop Festival]], at which the band performed with former [[Daily Flash]] and future [[Rhinoceros (band)|Rhinoceros]] member [[Doug Hastings]] on guitar and guest [[David Crosby]]. Young eventually returned on October 7 or 8th at the Third Eye in Redondo Beach, California, and after bidding adieu to Greene and Stone (Erteg\xc3\xbcn convinced the duo to release the band from production and management agreements), the band divided its time between playing concert gigs and putting the finishing touches on its second album, ultimately titled \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]\'\', produced by Erteg\xc3\xbcn himself.

Although more of an amalgam of individual work than an integrated group effort, \'\'Buffalo Springfield Again\'\' is considered by many critics and fans to be the group\'s finest record. Released in November 1967, it includes "Mr. Soul" (the version of which appears as the B side of the edited "Bluebird" has a completely different guitar lead than the stereo LP version and has yet to be issued on CD), "Rock & Roll Woman", "Bluebird", "Sad Memory", and "Broken Arrow." The group was featured playing "Bluebird" in an episode of the television series [[Mannix]] called "Warning: Live Blueberries", which aired on October 28, 1967.

For many Buffalo Springfield fans it is "Bluebird", a Stephen Stills composition, that was then and remains the band\'s peak. Unlike the studio version \xe2\x80\x93 which winds down after the instrumental break with a plaintive rendition of the third verse, accompanied by a banjo \xe2\x80\x93 in live performances the opening verses of "Bluebird" served as a springboard for an extended [[jam session]], during which Stills, Young and Furay intertwined guitars for minutes on end. One such "live jam" version which was officially released on the 1973 compilation \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield (compilation album)|Buffalo Springfield]]\'\' had become a staple of FM radio in the late \'60s and early \'70s.

=== \'\'Last Time Around\'\' ===

With strong reviews appearing all over the country, not only of \'\'[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]\'\' but of the band\'s performance as part of [[The Beach Boys]] Fifth Annual Thanksgiving Tour, things were looking up.

However, in January 1968 Palmer\'s second deportation for drug possession once again threw a wrench into the works. This time, guitarist and studio engineer [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] was hired as a permanent replacement on [[bass guitar|bass]]. With Palmer gone for good, Young also began to appear less and less frequently, often leaving Stills to handle all the lead guitar parts at concerts. Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on their final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing, but the group was clearly on the verge of disbanding. In April 1968, after yet another [[recreational drugs|drug]] bust involving Young, Furay, Messina and [[Eric Clapton]], the group decided to break up.

The final 20th century concert appearance was at the [[Long Beach Arena]] on May 5, 1968. After the band played many of its best-known tunes, an extended 20 plus-minute version of \xe2\x80\x9cBluebird\xe2\x80\x9d became the group\'s [[swan song]]. Buffalo Springfield disbanded a little more than two years after it had begun.

After the group\'s breakup, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into a third and final studio album, titled \'\'[[Last Time Around]]\'\'. Although it featured Furay\'s touching ballad "Kind Woman", Young\'s classic "I Am a Child" and Stills\' subtle political "Four Days Gone", only a few of the songs included more than two or three members of the group at a time. Even the cover photo was a montage, with Young\'s image added to a group profile of the other four members. Stills and Furay appeared on more tracks than any of the others, essentially dominating the album, but it did not light up the charts.

== Legacy ==
Despite their popularity, Buffalo Springfield was never a major commercial success. "For What It\xe2\x80\x99s Worth" was a significant hit and the group\'s legend grew stronger after the breakup, increasing with the later successes of its members. The longevity and impact on popular music several members would experience in the years to come solidified their early years of artistic creativity.

Stills went on to form [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of [[The Byrds]] and [[Graham Nash]] of [[The Hollies]] in 1968. Young launched a solo career, but in 1969 also reunited with Stills in [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], which saw the beginning of his sporadic relationship with that trio. Furay and Messina were founding members of [[Poco]]. Furay later joined [[J.D. Souther]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to form the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]], and Messina teamed with [[Kenny Loggins]] in [[Loggins & Messina]].

Palmer was CSNY\'s first choice to play bass, but due to various personal problems was replaced by [[Motown]] prodigy [[Greg Reeves]]. After recording a commercially unsuccessful jam-oriented solo album in 1970, Palmer faded into obscurity, although he did briefly play that same year with Toronto blues band [[Luke & The Apostles]]. In the early 1980s he appeared on Young\'s \'\'[[Trans (album)|Trans]]\'\' album and then played with Martin in the "Buffalo Springfield Revisited" tribute band in the mid-1980s.

== New Buffalo Springfield ==
Martin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed \'\'New Buffalo Springfield,\'\' the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]\'s stand-in with [[The Monkees]]) and [[Gary Rowles]] (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]), bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.

The new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized "Holiday Rock Festival" in San Francisco on December 25\xe2\x80\x9326, 1968, but soon fell afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band\'s name.

In February 1969 Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo Springfield with guitarist Bob "BJ" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman, was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for Uni Records. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which didn\'t appear on the album. During the 1970s he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.

In 1984 Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks and Stan Endersby to form the "Buffalo Springfield Revisited" Band. Dewey Martin was brought up to Toronto, Canada to join in the band and off they went on tour for the next 4, almost 5 years under this band name. Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave the BSR permission to tour with this name.

== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ==
In 1997 the group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], although Young did not appear at the induction ceremony. In 2001 an eponymous, career-spanning, four-disc [[Buffalo Springfield (box set)|box set]] was assembled by Young and released. The first three discs feature many alternate takes, demos and alternate mixes of the band\'s material, with the fourth containing the group\'s first two albums.

== Reunion ==
On his 2000 album \'\'[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]\'\', Young sang of his desire to reform the group and to \xe2\x80\x9csee those guys again and give it a shot\xe2\x80\x9d ("Buffalo Springfield Again"). A full reunion is no longer a possibility with the deaths of Palmer in 2004 and Martin in 2009. Surviving Buffalo Springfield members Young, Stills, and Furay reunited at the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in Mountain View, California.  \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' called the performance "nostalgic, blissful, and moving."<ref name="Greene 2010" />

Buffalo Springfield reunited for six concerts starting in [[Oakland]] on June 1, 2011, followed by dates in [[Los Angeles]],<ref name="Fusilli 2011" /> and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] before moving on to play the 2011 [[Bonnaroo]] Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The band consisted of Furay, Stills, and Young, with the lineup completed by Rick Rosas and [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]].<ref name="WashPost 2011/02" /><ref name="bonnaroo" />  According to Richie Furay and a band spokesman, the band were supposed do a full tour in 2012, but this was put on hold, because of Young recording two new albums with [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].<ref name="spinner 2011" />  On February 27, 2012, Furay announced that the band are on indefinite hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Greene |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-buffalo-springfield-reunion-appears-to-be-over-20120227 |title=The Buffalo Springfield Reunion Appears To Be Over &#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref>

Although McGuinn was widely regarded as the Byrds\' [[bandleader]] by this point, the band actually had multiple frontmen, with McGuinn, Clark, Crosby and later Hillman all taking turns to sing [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]] in roughly equal measures across the group\'s repertoire.  Despite the dizzying array of personnel changes that the group underwent in later years, this lack of a dedicated lead singer would remain a stylistic trait of the Byrds\' music throughout the majority of the band\'s existence.  A further distinctive aspect of the Byrds\' image was their unsmiling air of detachment, both on stage and in front of the camera.<ref name="timeless26"/><ref name="scoppa"/>  This natural aloofness was compounded by the large amounts of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] that the band consumed and often resulted in moody and erratic [[Rock concert|live performances]].<ref name="timeless26"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=96|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  Indeed, the contemporary music press was extremely critical of the Byrds\' abilities as a live act during the mid-1960s, with the reaction from the British media during the band\'s August 1965 tour of England being particularly scathing.<ref name="einarson7"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=50|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>

This 1965 English tour was largely orchestrated by the group\'s [[publicist]] [[Derek Taylor]], in an attempt to capitalize on the number 1 chart success of the "Mr. Tambourine Man" single.<ref name="einarson7"/>  Unfortunately, the tour was overhyped from the start, with the band being touted as "America\'s answer to the Beatles", a label that proved impossible for the Byrds to live up to.<ref name="einarson7"/>  During concert performances, a combination of poor sound, group illness, ragged musicianship, and the band\'s notoriously lackluster stage presence, all combined to alienate audiences and served to provoke a merciless castigating of the band in the British press.<ref name="einarson7"/>

While the Byrds outwardly seemed to be riding the crest of a wave during the latter-half of 1965, the recording sessions for their second album had not been without tension.  One source of conflict was the power struggle that had begun to develop between producer Terry Melcher and the band\'s manager Jim Dickson, with the latter harboring aspirations to produce the band himself, causing him to be overly critical of Melcher\'s work.<ref name="timeless25">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=147\xe2\x80\x93149|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  Within a month of \'\'Turn!

The song is marked by McGuinn\'s groundbreaking lead guitar playing, which saw the guitarist attempting to emulate the [[Free jazz|free form jazz]] [[saxophone]] playing of [[John Coltrane]], and in particular, Coltrane\'s playing on the song "India" from his \'\'[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]\'\' album.<ref name="einarson4"/>  "Eight Miles High" also exhibits the influence of the [[Indian classical music]] of [[Ravi Shankar]] in the droning quality of the song\'s vocal melody and in McGuinn\'s guitar playing.<ref name="lavezzoli">{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|pages=155\xe2\x80\x93157|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Crosby, David.|page=99|year=1990|title=Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby|publisher=Mandarin Paperbacks|isbn=0-7493-0283-6}}</ref>  The song\'s subtle use of Indian influences resulted in it being labeled as "raga rock" by the [[Music journalism|music press]], but in fact, it was the single\'s B-side "[[Why (The Byrds song)|Why]]" that drew more directly on Indian [[raga]]s.<ref name="einarson4"/><ref name="lavezzoli"/>

===Country rock (1968\xe2\x80\x931973)===

====The Gram Parsons era====
Following his induction into the band, [[Gram Parsons]] began to assert his own musical agenda in which he intended to marry his love of [[Country music|country and western]] music with youth culture\'s passion for rock and in doing so, make country music fashionable for a young audience.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=GP/Grievous Angel|others=[[Gram Parsons]]|year=1990|first=Marley|last=Brant|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Reprise Records]]}}</ref>  He found a kindred spirit in Hillman, who had played mandolin in a number of notable [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands before joining the Byrds.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/>  In addition, Hillman had also persuaded the Byrds to incorporate subtle country influences into their music in the past, beginning with the song "[[A Satisfied Mind|Satisfied Mind]]" on the \'\'Turn! Turn! Turn!\'\' album.<ref name="byrdwatcher5"/>  Although McGuinn had some reservations about the band\'s proposed new direction, Parsons convinced him that a move towards country music could theoretically expand the group\'s declining audience.<ref name="fricke4">{{cite AV media notes|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo: Legacy Edition|titlelink=Sweetheart of the Rodeo|others=The Byrds|year=2003|first=David|last=Fricke|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia/Legacy}}</ref>  Thus, McGuinn was persuaded to change direction and abandon his original concept for the group\'s next album, which had been to record a history of 20th century [[American popular music]], and instead explore [[country rock]].<ref name="byrdwatcher4"/><ref name="fricke4"/>

On March 9, 1968, the band decamped to Columbia\'s recording studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with Clarence White in tow, to begin the recording sessions for the \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\' album.<ref name="fricke4"/>  While in Nashville, the Byrds also appeared at the \'\'[[Grand Ole Opry]]\'\' on March 15, 1968, where they performed the [[Merle Haggard]] song "[[Sing Me Back Home (song)|Sing Me Back Home]]" and Parsons\' own "[[Hickory Wind]]" (although they were actually scheduled to play a second Haggard song, "Life in Prison").<ref name="hjort10">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=164\xe2\x80\x93165|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  Being the first group of [[hippie]] "longhairs" ever to play at the venerable country music institution, the band was met with heckling, booing, and mocking calls of "tweet, tweet" from the conservative \'\'Opry\'\' audience.<ref name="fricke4"/>

The band also incurred the wrath of renowned country music  [[Disk jockey|DJ]] [[Ralph Emery]], when they appeared on his Nashville-based [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] radio program.<ref name="hjort10"/>  Emery mocked the band throughout their interview and made no secret of his dislike for their newly recorded country rock single, "[[You Ain\'t Goin\' Nowhere]]".<ref name="byrdwatcher7">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpdbmh.html|accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>  Parsons and McGuinn would later write the pointedly sarcastic song "Drug Store Truck Drivin\' Man" about Emery and their appearance on his show.<ref name="hjort10"/><ref name="byrdwatcher7"/>  Journalist David Fricke has noted that the reactions of Emery and the \'\'Grand Ole Opry\'\' audience were indicative of the resistance and hostility that the Byrds\' venture into country music provoked from the Nashville old guard.<ref name="fricke3"/>

Following their stay in Nashville, the band returned to Los Angeles and throughout April and May 1968, they worked on completing their new country-oriented album.<ref name="fricke4"/>  During this period, Parsons attempted to exert a controlling influence over the group by pressuring McGuinn to recruit either JayDee<!--not "Jay Dee"--> Maness or [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]] as the band\'s permanent [[pedal steel guitar]] player.<ref name="timeless28">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=257\xe2\x80\x93258|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  When McGuinn refused, Parsons next began to push for a higher salary, while also demanding that the group be billed as "Gram Parsons and the Byrds" on their forthcoming album.<ref name="timeless27"/>  Even Hillman, who had previously been Parsons\' biggest supporter in the band, began to grow weary of his forceful demands.<ref name="timeless27"/>  Ultimately, Parsons\' behavior led to a power struggle for control of the group, with McGuinn finding his position as band leader challenged.<ref name="timeless28"/>  However, the April 1968 release of "You Ain\'t Goin\' Nowhere" served to strengthen McGuinn\'s position as head Byrd, with the guitarist\'s familiar drawl occupying the lead vocal spot and negligible input from Parsons, despite the single\'s obvious country leanings.<ref name="timeless28"/>

Parsons\' dominance over the band waned still further during post-production for \'\'Sweetheart of the Rodeo\'\', when his appearance on the album was contested by music business impresario [[Lee Hazlewood]], who alleged that the singer was still under contract to his [[LHI Records|LHI record label]], creating legal complications for Columbia Records.<ref name="fricke3"/>  As a result of this, McGuinn and Hillman replaced Parsons\' lead vocals on the songs "[[You Don\'t Miss Your Water]]", "The Christian Life", and "One Hundred Years from Now" before the legal problems could be resolved.<ref name="hjort11">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=176|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  However, album producer Gary Usher would later put a different slant on the events surrounding the removal of Parsons\' vocals by telling his biographer Stephen J. McParland that the alterations to the album arose out of creative concerns, not legal ones; Usher and the band were both worried that Parsons\' contributions were dominating the [[Gramophone record|record]] and so, his vocals were excised in an attempt to increase McGuinn and Hillman\'s presence on the album.<ref name="hjort11"/>  In the album\'s final running order, Parsons is still featured as lead vocalist on the songs "You\'re Still on My Mind", "Life in Prison", and "Hickory Wind".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo|others=The Byrds|year=1997|first=Johnny|last=Rogan|type=CD booklet|publisher=Columbia/Legacy}}</ref>

Following the release of \'\'Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde\'\', the band issued a cover of Dylan\'s "[[Lay Lady Lay]]" as a non-album single in May 1969, but it failed to reverse the group\'s ailing commercial fortunes in the U.S. and stalled at number 132.<ref name="hjort15"/>  The single caused a minor controversy between the Byrds and their producer Bob Johnston, when he took it upon himself to overdub a female [[choir]] onto the recording prior to its release.<ref name="hjort15"/>  It was only after the single was issued that the group became aware of Johnston\'s tampering, leaving them incensed by what they saw as an embarrassing and incongruous addition to their single.<ref name="byrdwatcher7"/><ref name="hjort15"/>  As a result of this incident, the band decided to dispense with Johnston and re-enlisted [[Terry Melcher]] to produce their next [[LP album|LP]] (Melcher had produced the band\'s first two albums back in 1965).<ref name="byrdwatcher7"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Ballad Of Easy Rider|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpboer.html|accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref>  Although he was happy to accept the band\'s invitation to produce their next [[Gramophone record|record]], Melcher insisted that he also be allowed to take on management duties for the group, in order to avoid a repeat of the conflict he had experienced in 1965 with Jim Dickson.<ref name="timeless17">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=290\xe2\x80\x93291|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>

[[File:David Crosby in 1976.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Following his dismissal from the band in 1967, David Crosby (pictured) was critical of Roger McGuinn\'s decision to recruit new band members, while continuing to use the Byrds name.]]
Following completion of the album recording sessions, Crosby persuaded McGuinn to dissolve the Columbia version of the Byrds, who were still touring at that time.<ref name="timeless30"/>  Crosby had long been vocal regarding his displeasure over McGuinn\'s decision to recruit new band members following his dismissal from the group in 1967, and had stated in a number of interviews that in his opinion "there were only ever five Byrds."<ref name="einarson8"/>  In keeping with the new spirit of reconciliation that the reunion fostered, McGuinn permanently disbanded the Columbia line-up of the group in February 1973.<ref name="fricke8"/>

The reunion album, titled simply \'\'[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]\'\', was released on March 7, 1973 to mixed reviews.<ref name="hjort27"/>  As a result, a planned tour in support of the album failed to materialize.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/>  Among the album\'s shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds\' signature jangly guitar sound.<ref name="hjort27"/>  Nonetheless, the album managed to climb to number 20 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK.<ref name="hjort27"/>  In the United States, the album became the band\'s highest charting LP of new material since 1965\'s \'\'[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (album)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\'\', which had also been the last Byrds\' album to feature Gene Clark as a full member.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/>  Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn\'s folk-flavored "Sweet Mary", the [[Joni Mitchell]] cover "For Free", a re-recording of Crosby\'s song "Laughing" (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, \'\'[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]\'\'), and a pair of [[Neil Young]] songs.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/>  The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions "Changing Heart" and "[[Full Circle Song|Full Circle]]", the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its [[working title]] and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.<ref name="hjort27"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=349|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>

The negative critical reception that \'\'Byrds\'\' received in the music press resulted in the band losing faith in the idea of an ongoing series of reunions.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/>  In the years following its release, all five band members were openly critical of the album, with the general consensus being that the material included on it was weak and that the recording sessions had been rushed and ill-thought out.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/>  In addition, McGuinn and Hillman have both suggested that with the exception of Gene Clark, the songwriting members of the band were reluctant to bring their strongest compositions to the recording sessions, preferring instead to hold those songs back for their own solo projects.<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/><ref name="einarson8"/>  In the wake of the reunion, the five original Byrds quietly returned to their own careers,<ref name="byrdwatcher10"/> with the June 1973 release of McGuinn\'s [[Roger McGuinn (album)|eponymously titled solo album]] serving to effectively mark the end of the Byrds.

Following the reunion of 1972/1973, the Byrds remained disbanded throughout the rest of the decade.<ref name="allmusic"/>  Roger McGuinn turned his attention to establishing his own career, releasing a series of solo albums between 1973 and 1977, and making a high-profile appearance with [[Bob Dylan]]\'s [[Rolling Thunder Revue]].<ref name="allmusic2"/>  Chris Hillman worked as part of the [[Souther\xe2\x80\x93Hillman\xe2\x80\x93Furay Band]] following the Byrds reunion and released a pair of solo albums entitled \'\'Slippin\' Away\'\' and \'\'Clear Sailin\'\'\' in 1976 and 1977 respectively.<ref name="allmusic9"/>  David Crosby returned to the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] for their 1974 tour and subsequently continued to produce albums with [[Graham Nash]].<ref name="allmusic13"/>  He also took part in a 1977 reunion of Crosby, Stills & Nash, which saw the group release their multi-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] selling \'\'[[CSN (album)|CSN]]\'\' album.<ref name="allmusic13"/>  Michael Clarke also found success following the Byrds reunion as the drummer for [[soft rock]] group [[Firefall]],<ref name="allmusic7"/> while Gene Clark returned to his solo career, producing the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful albums \'\'[[No Other]]\'\' (1974) and \'\'[[Two Sides to Every Story]]\'\' (1977).<ref name="allmusic5"/>  In addition, between 1977 and 1980, McGuinn, Clark and Hillman worked on and off together as a trio, modeled after Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and, to a lesser extent, the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder|first=Bruce|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguinn-clark-hillman-p4872/biography|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref>  This supergroup made up of former Byrds was reasonably successful commercially and even managed to score a Top 40 hit with the single "[[Don\'t You Write Her Off]]" in March 1979.<ref name="byrdwatcher11">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=McGuinn, Clark & Hillman|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spmch1.html|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Whitburn, Joel.|page=556|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}</ref>  The trio toured internationally and recorded the albums \'\'McGuinn, Clark & Hillman\'\' and \'\'City\'\'.<ref name="byrdwatcher11"/>  Clark departed the group in late 1979, resulting in a third and final album being billed as McGuinn-Hillman.<ref name="byrdwatcher11"/>

====Ersatz Byrds and further reunions (1989\xe2\x80\x931991; 2000)====
In 1984, Gene Clark approached McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman in an attempt to reform the Byrds in time for the 20th anniversary of the release of the "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" single in 1985.<ref name="byrdwatcher12">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Byrds v.

In retaliation against Clarke\'s trademark application, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman submitted their own counter-claim to gain ownership of the band\'s name.<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>  McGuinn had actually attempted to trademark the Byrds name himself during the 1970s, in order to prevent its misuse, but his application had been turned down.<ref name="timeless32"/>  To strengthen their case, the three musicians announced in December 1988 that they would be performing a series of concerts in January 1989 as the Byrds.<ref name="timeless32"/><ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>  Although he was no longer connected with Clarke\'s tribute act, Gene Clark was not invited to participate in these official Byrds reunion concerts due to residual ill-feeling stemming from his earlier "20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds".<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>

The reunion concerts were a resounding success but with Michael Clarke continuing to tour with his Byrds tribute, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman filed a lawsuit against the drummer in the spring of 1989, suing him for allegedly false advertising, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, as well as seeking a preliminary injunction against Clarke\'s use of the name.<ref name="timeless32"/><ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>  At the court hearing in May 1989, the judge denied the injunction, ruling that McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman had failed to show that they would be irreparably damaged by Clarke\'s actions.<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/>  As a result, Clarke gained full legal ownership of the name the Byrds.<ref name="hjort29">{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=323\xe2\x80\x93324|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  In the wake of this ruling, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman dropped their lawsuit, but to demonstrate that they had not wholly surrendered the Byrds name to Clarke, the three musicians appeared under the banner of "The Original Byrds" at a [[Roy Orbison]] tribute concert on February 24, 1990, where they were joined on-stage by Bob Dylan for a rendition of "Mr. Tambourine Man".<ref name="byrdwatcher13"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=439|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  Later that year, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman entered Treasure Isle Recorders in Nashville to record four new Byrds tracks for inclusion on the forthcoming \'\'[[The Byrds (boxed set)|The Byrds]]\'\' [[box set]].<ref name="timeless33"/>

(to Everything There Is a Season)".<ref name="rollingstone"/>  According to contemporary press reports, the reunion was an unmitigated success, with the audience giving the band multiple standing ovations and shouting for more as they left the stage.<ref name="rollingstone"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Bleetstein|first=Rob|title=Byrds Reunion Caps Star-Studded Benefit|publisher=[[VH1]]|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1122999/20000811/index.jhtml|accessdate=2011-04-29}}</ref>

During the 2000s, two more ex-members of the Byrds died when drummer [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]] succumbed of natural causes in 2002<ref>{{cite news|title=Kevin Kelley Obituary|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/02/local/me-passings2.5|accessdate=2011-04-24|date=2002-05-02}}</ref> and bassist Skip Battin, who was suffering from [[Alzheimer\'s disease]], died at his home in 2003.<ref name="hjort29"/>  Former members [[Gene Parsons]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]] both remain active and continue to perform and record various musical projects.<ref name="hjort29"/>  Perhaps the most surprising development in the Byrds\' story during the 2000s, however, was the acquisition by David Crosby of the rights to the band\'s name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>  Ownership of the Byrds\' name had reverted to Clarke\'s estate upon his death in 1993 and Crosby\'s purchase served to effectively bring the convoluted battle for control of the group\'s name to an end.

To date, the Fred Walecki tribute concert appearance in 2000 represents the last time that the Byrds have performed together.  However, Hillman and Crosby have both expressed an interest in working with McGuinn again on future Byrds projects, but the lead guitarist and head Byrd remains adamant that he is not interested in another reunion.<ref name="hjort29"/>  During an interview with music journalist John Nork, McGuinn replied "absolutely not," when asked if he had any plans to revive the Byrds, explaining, "No, I don\'t want to do that. I just want to be a solo artist. The Byrds are well documented. I don\'t think we need anymore from the Byrds."<ref name="hjort29"/>

===Legacy===
Since the band\'s 1960s heyday, the influence of the Byrds on successive generations of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]] musicians has grown steadily, with acts such as the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Big Star]], [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]], [[R.E.M.]], [[the Bangles]], [[the Smiths]], and innumerable [[alternative rock]] bands of the post-[[Punk rock|punk]] era all exhibiting signs of their influence.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="smith"/><ref name="hjort29"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hoard|first=Joel|title=The Byrds Biography|publisher=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-byrds/biography|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=417|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as "one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles", while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with [[electric instrument]]ation.<ref name="lavezzoli2">{{cite book|last=Lavezzoli|first=Peter|page=162|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}</ref>  Lavezzoli concluded that "like it or not, terms like "folk rock," "raga rock" and "country rock" were coined for a reason: the Byrds did it first, and then kept moving, never staying in the "raga" or "country" mode for very long. This is precisely what made the Byrds such a rewarding band to follow from one record to the next."<ref name="lavezzoli2"/>

In his book \'\'The Great Rock Discography\'\', music researcher [[Martin C. Strong]] describes the Byrds\' cover of "Mr. Tambourine Man" as "a timeless slice of hypnotic, bittersweet pop" and a record that "did nothing less than change the course of pop/rock history."<ref>{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin C|authorlink=Martin C.

In his book \'\'Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock \'n\' Roll\'s Last Stand in 60s Hollywood\'\', music historian [[Domenic Priore]] attempts to sum up the band\'s influence by noting, "Few of The Byrds\' contemporaries can claim to have made such a subversive impact on popular culture. The band had a much larger, more positive impact on the world at large than any \'\'Billboard\'\' chart position or album sales or concert attendance figure could possibly measure."<ref>{{cite book|author=Priore, Domenic.|page=85|year=2007|title=Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock \'n\' Roll\'s Last Stand in 60s Hollywood|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-04-5}}</ref>

In 2004, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine ranked the Byrds at number 45 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petty|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Petty|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time - No.&nbsp;45: The Byrds|publisher=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-byrds-20110420|accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref>

==Early years==

==The Kentucky Colonels==
{{main|Kentucky Colonels (band)}}
In September 1962, the Country Boys recorded their debut [[album]] for Briar International.<ref name="hjort"/>  At Maphis\'s suggestion, the band changed their name to the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]],<ref name="hjort"/> with their album being released in early 1963, under the title \'\'The New Sound of Bluegrass America\'\'.<ref name="timeless2">{{Cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|pages=581\xe2\x80\x93584|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited - The Sequel|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  Around this time, Clarence\'s [[flatpicking]] guitar style was becoming a much more prominent part of the group\'s music.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  After attending a performance by [[Doc Watson]] at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar\'s role in bluegrass music.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as Doc Watson, [[Earl Scruggs]] and [[Don Reno]], exploring its potential for soloing.<ref name="Kingsbury"/>  White soon began to integrate elements of Watson\'s playing style, including the use of open strings and syncopation, into his own flatpicking guitar technique.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument<ref name="timeless2"/> was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.<ref name="rollingstone">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/clarence-white-20111122|title=100 Greatest Guitarists: Clarence White|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref>  In addition to being accomplished musicians, the Kentucky Colonels\' music often featured close [[Vocal harmony|harmony vocals]], with Clarence singing [[Lead vocal|lead]] and [[baritone]], Roland singing lead and [[tenor]], Roger on lead and [[bass (voice type)|bass]], and Billy Ray singing lead, tenor and [[Baritone#Baritone voices in other music|high baritone]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin\' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=1975|first=John|last=Kaparakis|page=Back cover|type=Album notes|publisher=Briar International Records|location=Tennessee}}</ref>

Following the release of their debut album, the Kentucky Colonels played a multitude of live appearances throughout California and the United States, including an appearance at the prestigious Monterey Folk Festival in May 1963.<ref name="hjort"/>  Between these bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Marshall Brickman]]\'s \'\'New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass\'\' album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the [[soundtrack album]] to the film \'\'[[Deliverance]]\'\' (with Weissberg and Steve Mandell\'s version of "[[Dueling Banjos]]" added to the album\'s track listing).<ref name="byrdwatcher"/><ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=dueling-banjos-mw0000651271|pure_url=yes}}|title="Dueling Banjos" from the Original Soundtrack Deliverance album review|last=Johnson|first=Zac|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corp|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref>

Throughout 1964, the Kentucky Colonels continued to make live appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals.<ref name="hjort"/>  They were also signed to [[Pacific Jazz Records|World Pacific Records]] by [[record producer]] Jim Dickson,<ref name="hjort2">{{Cite book|last=Hjort|first=Christopher|page=18|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965\xe2\x80\x931973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|location=London|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref> who would later become the manager of [[folk rock]] band [[The Byrds]].

Shortly after the recording of the \'\'Appalachian Swing!\'\' album, Roland and Clarence undertook some [[Session musician|session work]] backing dobroist [[Tut Taylor]] on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific in late 1964 as \'\'Dobro Country\'\'.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>

Although they were now a successful bluegrass recording act, it was becoming increasingly hard for the Kentucky Colonels to make a living playing bluegrass.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  The [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s, which had helped facilitate the Colonels\' commercial success, had been delt a serious blow in 1964 by the popularity of the [[Pop music|pop]] and [[beat music]] of the [[British Invasion]].  However, it wasn\'t until mid-1965, with the release of The Byrds\' folk rock single "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and [[Bob Dylan]]\'s "[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]", that the folk revival\'s popularity began to seriously wane.  Before long, many young folk performers and some bluegrass acts were switching to [[electric instrument]]ation.<ref name="byrdwatcher"/>  The Kentucky Colonels followed suit, plugging in with electric instruments and hiring a [[drummer]] in mid-1965, in order to keep a concert booking as a country dance band at a [[bowling alley]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Delgatto|first=John|title=The Too-Short Career of Clarence White|pages=12\xe2\x80\x9314|newspaper=Frets Magazine|publisher=GPI Publications|location=Cupertino, California|year=1986}}</ref>  The band added fiddle player Scotty Stoneman to their line-up in mid-1965, as a replacement for Sloan,<ref name="byrdwatcher"/> but some months later, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band after playing their final show on October 31, 1965.<ref name="timeless2"/>

Clarence reunited with his brothers Roland and Eric in 1966, along with Dennis Morris ([[rhythm guitar]]), Bob Warford (banjo), and Bobby Crane (fiddle) to form a new Kentucky Colonels line-up.<ref name="byrdwatcher2">{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Clarence White Plugs In: 1965-1968|publisher=Euclid Business Network|website=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/memcw2.html|accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref>  This version of the band made sporadic concert appearances and recorded a series of [[Demo recording|demos]] that were eventually released in 1979 as the album \'\'Kentucky Colonels 1966\'\'.<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  The group continued playing until 1967, when Clarence was asked to play with [[Bill Monroe|Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys]].<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  Clarence declined the offer, but recommended his brother Roland for the job.<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  Roland joined Monroe as a guitarist and the Colonels once more disbanded.<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>

==Session work (1966\xe2\x80\x931968)==
During 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards [[rock \'n\' roll]] as an avenue for artistic expression.<ref name="timeless"/>  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like Doc Watson, Don Reno and Joe Maphis, he also idolized the playing of [[jazz guitarist]] [[Django Reinhardt]], rock \'n\' roller [[Chuck Berry]], and studio musician [[James Burton]].<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song "Mr. Tambourine Man" with electric instruments.<ref name="timeless"/>  However, despite White\'s enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment\'s validity<ref name="timeless"/> and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson\'s proteges The Byrds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schinder|first1=Scott|last2=Schwartz|first2=Andy|page=261|year=2008|title=Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever \xe2\x80\x93 Volume 1|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}</ref>

By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist.<ref name="timeless"/>  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his [[Martin D-28]] acoustic guitar to an electric [[Fender Telecaster]], with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton.<ref name="lightning"/>  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from [[open chord]]ing to [[fret]]ting the whole [[Neck (music)|guitar neck]] with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls.<ref name="lightning"/>  However, he soon mastered the intricacies of electric guitar and began to undertake session work for artists including [[Ricky Nelson]], [[The Monkees]], and the [[Vern Gosdin|Gosdin Brothers]].<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="byrdwatcher2"/> 
  
As 1965 turned into 1966, White met [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Gib Guilbeau]] at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel Roger Bush on bass.<ref name="byrdwatcher2"/>  In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide [[lead guitar]] to ex-Byrd [[Gene Clark]]\'s debut solo album, \'\'[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]\'\'.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|page=111|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds\' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref>  White also briefly joined Clark\'s touring band shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|page=117|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds\' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref>

During the Clark album sessions, White reconnected with mandolin player and [[bassist]] [[Chris Hillman]], who he had known during the early 1960s as a member of the bluegrass combo [[The Hillmen]].<ref name="hjort3">{{Cite book|last=Hjort|first=Christopher|pages=113\xe2\x80\x93115|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock \'n\' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965\xe2\x80\x931973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|location=London|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  Hillman was currently a member of The Byrds and in December 1966, he invited White to contribute countrified lead guitar playing to his songs "Time Between" and "The Girl with no Name", which both appeared on The Byrds\' \'\'[[Younger Than Yesterday]]\'\' album.<ref name="hjort3"/>  The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of a stylistic departure for the group and can be seen as an early indicator of the experimentation with country music that would color The Byrds\' subsequent work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Connors|first=Tim|title=Younger Than Yesterday|publisher=Euclid Business Network|website=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpyty.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>  White also contributed guitar to the band\'s follow-up album, \'\'[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]\'\',<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Desperados: The Roots of Country Rock|year=2001|publisher=Cooper Square Press|location=New York City|isbn=0-81541-065-4|page=77}}</ref> and to their seminal 1968 [[country rock]] release, \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\'.<ref name="allmusic3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nashville-west-mn0000316537/biography|title=Nashville West biography|last=Hage|first=Erik|authorlink=Erik Hage|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corp|accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref>

In July 1967, White signed with [[Gary S.

Returning to the U.S., White\'s final bout of touring took place with the New Kentucky Colonels in June 1973, as part of a four-date country rock package tour with Gram Parsons, [[Emmylou Harris]], Country Gazette, [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], Gene Parsons, [[Byron Berline]], and [[Chris Ethridge]] among others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=David N.|title=Twenty Thousand Roads: The Ballad of Gram Parsons and His Cosmic American Music|year=2007|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-375-50570-6|pages=404\xe2\x80\x93405}}</ref>  Although Gram and Clarence had been acquainted with one another since The Byrds\' \'\'Sweetheart of the Rodeo\'\' sessions, the pair would develop a fast friendship during the mini-tour, after, what was by all accounts, a very acrimonious re-acquaintance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Fong-Torres|title=Hickory Wind: The Life and Times of Gram Parsons|year=1998|publisher=[[St. Martin\'s Griffin]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-312-19464-2|page=}}</ref>  Following the end of the package tour, White entered the recording studio with producer Jim Dickson on June 28 and 29, 1973 to begin work on a solo album.<ref name="silver">{{cite AV media notes|title=Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology|others=Various artists|year=1980|last=Koon|first=William Henry|type=LP sleeve|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Los Angeles}}</ref>  He recorded a total of six songs,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Requiem for the Timeless: Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=Rogan House|location=London|isbn=978-0-95295-408-8|pages=625\xe2\x80\x93626}}</ref> four of which would belatedly be released on the archival album \'\'Silver Meteor: A Progressive Country Anthology\'\' in 1980.<ref name="silver"/>

White died on July 14, 1973 after being struck by a [[drunk driver]]. The accident occurred shortly after 2 a.m., while he and his brother Roland were loading equipment into their car in Palmdale, California, following a spur-of-the-moment reunion gig of the Colonels. Especially shaken by his death was Gram Parsons, who would lead a singalong of "Farther Along" at the funeral service and conceive his final song before his own death, "In My Hour of Darkness", as a partial tribute to White.

Clarence White was survived by his brothers Roland and Eric and sisters JoAnne and Rosemarie, and his one daughter, Michelle.

==Musical influence==
Clarence White helped popularize the acoustic guitar as a lead instrument in bluegrass music, building on the work of guitarists such as Doc Watson. Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist [[Don Reno]]). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], and [[Tony Rice]].  Rice owns and plays White\'s highly modified 1935 [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28. [[David Grier]] and [[Russ Barenberg]] are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White\'s guitar work.  White\'s bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref name="lightning"/> who traveled with the band during 1964.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin\' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=2003|first=John|last=Delgatto|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena}}</ref>

On the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Together with fellow Byrds bandmember [[Gene Parsons]], White invented the [[B-Bender]] device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a "[[pedal steel]]" type sound. [[Arlen Roth]], heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, "Nashville Guitar", all of his recordings, as well as his book "Masters of the Telecaster". Subsequently, his [[Telecaster]] sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. [[Marty Stuart]], another guitarist influenced by White\'s playing, now owns and regularly plays White\'s 1954 [[Fender Telecaster]] with the prototype B-Bender.<ref>[http://www.martystuart.com/ZArt-GuitarPlayer8-94.htm] Gill, Chris: "Steel And Wood, Heart And Soul - The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection," reprinted from \'\'Guitar Player Magazine\'\', August 1994.</ref>

Music archivist and writer Alec Palao has called White "one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music", before adding that "the waves created by the guitarist\'s idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock \'n\' roll."<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Tuff & Stringy: Sessions 1966-68|chapter=Part One: Sometimes the Journey Can Be as Interesting as the Destination|others=Clarence White|year=2003|last=Palao|first=Alec|page=4|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]]|location=London}}</ref>  In 2003, White was ranked No.&nbsp;41 on \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine\'s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time. In 2010, guitar manufacturer [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] ranked White at No.&nbsp;42 on their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-524/|title=Gibson.com Top 50 Guitarists of All Time \xe2\x80\x93 50 to 41|publisher=Gibson.com|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>

In 1955, the family moved to [[Madison, Tennessee]], while the brothers moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

===1950s===
While in Knoxville, the brothers caught the attention of family friend [[Chet Atkins]], manager of RCA Victor\'s studio in Nashville. The brothers became a duo and moved to Nashville.<ref name="Lazell p. 171">Lazell, Barry ed., with Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, \'\'Rock Movers & Shakers,\'\' Billboard Publications, New York, 1989 p. 171</ref>  Despite affiliation with RCA, Atkins arranged for the Everly Brothers to record for [[Columbia Records]] in early 1956. Their "Keep A\' Lovin\' Me," which Don wrote, flopped and they were dropped.

Atkins introduced them to Wesley Rose of [[Acuff-Rose]] music publishers. Rose told them he would get them a recording deal if they signed to Acuff-Rose as songwriters. They signed in late 1956, and in 1957 Rose introduced them to [[Archie Bleyer]],<ref>Alan Frazer, "The Everly Saga, $$."

Working with the Bryants, they had hits in the United States and the United Kingdom, the biggest "[[Wake Up Little Susie]]", "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]", "[[Bird Dog (song)|Bird Dog]]", and "Problems". The Everlys also succeeded as songwriters, especially with Don\'s "[[(Till) I Kissed You]]", which hit No.&nbsp;4 on the United States pop charts.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, \'\'The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\'\', Billboard Books, NY 1992 p. 165.</ref>

The brothers toured with [[Buddy Holly]] in 1957 and 1958.

{{BLP sources section|date=July 2013}}
After three years on Cadence, the Everlys signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1960,<ref name="AMG"/> for 10 years. Their first hit for Warner Brothers, 1960\'s "[[Cathy\'s Clown]]" (written by Don and Phil), sold eight million, the duo\'s biggest-selling. "Cathy\'s Clown" was number WB1, the first in the United Kingdom by Warner Bros. Records.

Other successful Warner Brothers singles followed in the United States, such as "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)" (1960, Pop No.&nbsp;7), "Walk Right Back" (1961, Pop No.&nbsp;7), "Crying In The Rain" (1962, Pop No.&nbsp;6), and "That\'s Old Fashioned" (1962, Pop No.&nbsp;9, their last Top 10 hit). From 1960 to 1962, Cadence Records released Everly Brothers singles from the vaults, including "[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]" (written by Phil, Pop No.&nbsp;8) and "Like Strangers".

In the UK, they had Top 10 hits until 1965, including "Lucille/So Sad" (1960, No.&nbsp;4), "Walk Right Back/Ebony Eyes (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "Temptation" (1961, No.&nbsp;1), "Cryin\' In The Rain" (1962, No.&nbsp;6) and "The Price of Love" (1965, No.&nbsp;2). They had 18 singles into the UK Top 40 with Warner Brothers in the 1960s. By 1962, the brothers had earned $35 million from record sales.

In 1961, the brothers fell out with Wesley Rose during the recording of "Temptation". Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he didn\'t publish (and which he wouldn\'t receive publishing royalties for), and made strenuous efforts to block the single\'s release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s the Everlys were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written most of their hits, as well as Don and Phil Everly themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. Regardless, from 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other writers to avoid paying royalties to Acuff-Rose. They did use the pseudonym "Jimmy Howard" as writer and/or arranger on two tracks\xe2\x80\x94unsuccessfully, however, as Acuff-Rose assumed the copyrights once the ruse was discovered.

Around this same time, they set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects.  Using the pseudonym "Adrian Kimberly," Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of "[[Pomp and Circumstance]]" arranged by [[Neal Hefti]], and charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961.  Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed but none charted.  Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, "Melodrama," failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records was no more.

They never stopped working as a duo but their last United States Top Ten hit was 1962\'s "That\'s Old Fashioned", a song recorded but unreleased by the Chordettes and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer. Succeeding years saw the Everly Brothers sell fewer records in the United States. Their enlistment in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in October 1961 (rather than being drafted into the Army for two years of active service) took them out of the spotlight.<ref>Natalie Best.

Following active duty, they resumed their career but United States success was limited. Of their 27 singles on Warner Brothers from 1963 through 1970, only three made the Hot 100 and none peaked higher than No.&nbsp;31.  Album sales were also down. The Everlys\' first two albums for Warner (in 1960 and 1961) peaked at No.&nbsp;9 U.S., but after that, of a dozen more LPs for Warner Brothers, only one made the top 200 (1965\'s \'\'Beat & Soul\'\', which peaked at No.&nbsp;141). Their dispute with Acuff-Rose lasted until 1964, whereupon the brothers again began writing as well as working with the Bryants again.

By then the brothers were addicted to [[Amphetamine|speed]]. Don\'s condition was worse, taking [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin]] which led to deeper trouble. Don\'s addiction lasted three years until he was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown and to cure his addiction.<ref name="RSEncyc">\'\'The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\'\' (Simon & Schuster, 2001)</ref> (It should be noted that the mainstream media of that time did not report that either brother was addicted.

Hospital." Boston Traveler, October 16, 1962, p. 54.</ref>  It was years later that the story came out.)  Don\'s health ended their British tour; he returned to the United States, leaving Phil to carry on with Joey Page, their bass player, taking his place. [[File:Everly Brothers 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|Performing on the 1970 Johnny Cash summer replacement show]]

Though their U.S. stardom had begun to wane two years before the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, their appeal remained in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia.  The Everlys remained successful in the UK and Canada throughout most of the 1960s, reaching the top 40 in the United Kingdom through 1968, and the top 10 in Canada as late as 1967. The 1966 album \'\'[[Two Yanks in England]]\'\' was recorded in England with [[the Hollies]], who also wrote many of the album\'s songs. 1967 brought the Everlys\' final Top US 40 hit, ("Bowling Green").

By the end of the 1960s, the brothers returned to country-rock and their 1968 album \'\'[[Roots (The Everly Brothers album)|Roots]]\'\' is touted by some critics as "one of the finest early country-rock albums."<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6937|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roots The Everly Brothers|publisher=Allmusic.com}}</ref> However, by the end of the 1960s, the Everly Brothers were no longer hitmakers in either North America or the United Kingdom, and in 1970, following an unsuccessful live album (\'\'The Everly Brothers Show\'\'), their contract with Warner Brothers lapsed after ten years. In 1970, they were the summer replacement hosts for [[Johnny Cash]]\'s television show: their variety program, "Johnny Cash Presents the Everly Brothers," was on ABC-TV and featured [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>"Everly Brothers Return." Cleveland Plain Dealer, July 5, 1970, p. 29E.</ref>

In 1970, Don\'s first solo album was not a success. The brothers resumed performing in 1971, and with [[RCA Victor Records]] they issued two albums in 1972 and 1973. They said their final performance would be on July 14, 1973, at Knott\'s Berry Farm in California, but tensions between the two surfaced and Don told a reporter he was tired of being an Everly Brother.<ref>Marilyn and Hy Gardner, "Everly Brothers Too Close for Too Long."

===Solo years: 1973\xe2\x80\x931983===
Phil and Don pursued solo careers during a decade. Don found some success on the US. country charts in the mid to late 1970s, in Nashville with his band Dead Cowboys, and playing with [[Albert Lee]]. Don also performed solo in London in mid-1976 at an annual country music festival.  His appearance was well-received and he was given "thunderous applause," even though critics noted that performance was uneven.<ref>Ed Blanche, "Everly Laid Back." Springfield (MA) Union, June 21, 1977, p. 26.</ref>

Phil sang backup for [[Roy Wood]]\'s 1975 album \'\'Mustard\'\' and two songs for [[Warren Zevon]]\'s 1976  album \'\'[[Warren Zevon (album)|Warren Zevon]]\'\'.<ref>album liner notes</ref>

In 1979, Don recorded "Everytime You Leave," with [[Emmylou Harris]], on her album \'\'[[Blue Kentucky Girl (Emmylou Harris album)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artandculture.com/users/1120-everly-brothers |title=Everly Brothers @ Art + Culture |publisher=Artandculture.com |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>

Phil recorded more frequently but with no chart success until the 1980s.  Phil wrote "Don\'t Say You Don\'t Love Me No More" for the [[Clint Eastwood]] comedy film, \'\'[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]\'\' (1978) in which he performed it as a duet with co-star [[Sondra Locke]]. He also wrote "One Too Many Women In Your Life" for the sequel, \'\'[[Any Which Way You Can]]\'\' (1980) playing in the band behind Sondra\'s.

Then, in 1983, Phil had UK success as a soloist with the album \'\'Phil Everly,\'\' recorded mainly in London.  Musicians on the LP included [[Dire Straits]] guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Rockpile]] drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] and keyboard player [[Pete Wingfield]]. The track "She Means Nothing To Me," written by [[John David Williams]] and featuring [[Cliff Richard]] as co-lead vocalist, was a UK Top 10 hit, and "Louise", written by [[Ian Gomm]], reached the Top 50 in 1983.

===Reunion and subsequent activities: 1983\xe2\x80\x932006===
The brothers\' reunion concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] on September 23, 1983, was initiated by Phil and Don alongside Terry Slater. English pianist Pete Wingfield was musical director. This concert spawned a live LP and video broadcast on cable television in mid-January 1984.<ref>"Cable Concert Appearance Reunites the Everly Brothers." Newark (NJ) Star-Ledger, January 6, 1984, p. 38.</ref>  The brothers returned to the studio as a duo for the first time in over a decade, resulting in the album \'\'EB \'84,\'\' produced by [[Dave Edmunds]].  Lead single "On the Wings of a Nightingale," written by [[Paul McCartney]], was a qualified success (Top 10 adult contemporary)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/eb-84-mw0000189823/awards |title=EB 84 - The Everly Brothers &#124; Awards |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> and returned them to the United States Hot 100 (for their last appearance) and UK chart.
[[File:Everlys 3.jpg|thumb|The Everly Brothers performing live in New York]]

Their final charting was "Born Yesterday" in 1986 from the album of the same name. They collaborated with other performers, usually singing either backup vocals or duets.In 1990, Phil recorded a duet with Dutch singer [[:nl: Rene Shuman|Ren\xc3\xa9 Shuman]]. "On Top of the World" was written by Phil and appeared in the music video they recorded in Los Angeles. The track appeared on Shuman\'s album \'\'Set the Clock on Rock.\'\' In 1994, a 1981 live [[BBC]] recording of "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]," featuring Cliff Richard and Phil sharing vocals, was a UK Top-20 hit.<ref name="Sleeve notes from \'All I Have to Do Is Dream\' single">{{cite AV media notes | title="All I Have to Do Is Dream (single)"| others=Cliff Richard with Phil Everly|date=1994| publisher=EMI| location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

Phil provided backing vocals on "You Got Gold" from John Prine\'s 1991 album \'\'The Missing Years\'\'.  Both the Everlys and Prine had family connections to Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, and Prine was a frequent performer at "The Everly Brother\'s Homecoming" concerts in Central City, Kentucky, over the years.

In 1998, the brothers recorded "Cold" for the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Jim Steinman]]\'s \'\'[[Whistle Down the Wind (musical)|Whistle Down the Wind]],\'\' and the recording was used in stage versions as a "song on the radio." This would be the final original recording ever made by the Everly Brothers as a band.

In 1999, Don Everly and Edan performed "The Everly Brothers for Kentucky Flood Relief".

The brothers joined [[Simon & Garfunkel]] in their "Old Friends" reunion tour of 2003 and 2004. As a tribute to the Everly Brothers, Simon & Garfunkel opened their own show and had the Everlys come out in the middle. The live album, \'\'[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]]\'\', contains Simon & Garfunkel discussing the Everlys\' influence on their career and features all four in on "Bye Bye Love" (the subsequent DVD features two extra solo performances by the Everlys).  For Paul Simon, it was not the first time he had performed with his heroes, as in 1986, the Everlys sang background vocals on the title track of Simon\'s album \'\'Graceland\'\'.

In 2004, a compilation titled \'\'Country Classics\'\' was released, consisting of tracks recorded in 1972 and 1985.

In 2006, Phil Everly sang  "Sweet Little Corrina" with country singer [[Vince Gill]] on his album \'\'[[These Days (Vince Gill album)|These Days]].\'\'<ref>{{cite web|author=Thom Jurek |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/these-days-mw0000402550 |title=These Days - Vince Gill &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2006-10-17 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref> He previously supplied harmony vocals on [[J.

Don said that weak lungs ran in the family as their father Ike, had died of [[black lung disease]]. He admitted that he had lived "a very difficult life" with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something which was mainly attributed to "their vastly different views on politics and life" with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying "it\'s almost like we could read each other\'s minds when we sang.". However, Don also stated that he had not gotten "over" Phil\'s death, which he elaborated by saying: "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he\'s gone.". Don added that he always firmly believed he would die before Phil due to Don being older.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2014/apr/03/entertainment/la-et-ms-don-everly-brothers-phil-death-obituary-20140402</ref>

===Recent activities===
On October 25, 2014, Don Everly attended the 2014 Annual Music Masters as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid homage to the Everly Brothers. Don took the State Theater stage and performed his and his brother\'s classic hit [[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4Iq382I_UQ</ref>

==Style and influences==
Don and Phil, both guitarists, used vocal [[harmony]] mostly based on diatonic [[interval (music)#Interval number and quality|thirds]]. With this, each line can stand on its own as a [[melody]] line.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This is in contrast to classic harmony lines which, while working well alongside the melody, are not as melodic by themselves.

On most recordings, Don sings the baritone part and Phil the tenor harmony .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sacurrent.com/sasound/phil-everly-of-the-everly-brothers-dead-at-74/|title=Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers, Dead at 74|publisher=San Antonio Current|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/01/07/ever-j07.html|title=An appreciation of Phil Everly and the Everly Brothers|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref> A few exceptions are "Made To Love" ([[A Date with the Everly Brothers]]), "T For Texas" ([[Roots]]), as well as "Always Drive A Cadillac" ([[Born Yesterday]]). These songs feature Phil on lead, with Don providing the harmony. Don [usually sang most of the] solo lines (for example, the verses of "Bye Bye Love"); among the few exceptions is the 1965 single "It\'s All Over", where Phil sings the song\'s solo lines.

In the late 1950s, the Everly Brothers were the rock \'n\' roll youth movement\'s addition to [[close harmony]] vocal groups of which many were family bands. They influenced rock groups of the 1960s.

In 1986, the Everly Brothers were among the first 10 artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].  They were introduced by [[Neil Young]], who observed that every musical group he belonged to had tried and failed to copy the Everly Brothers\' harmonies. That year, on July 5, the Everlys returned to Shenandoah to a crowd of 8,500 for a concert, parade, street dedication, class reunion, and other activities. Concert fees were donated to the Everly Family Scholarship Fund which gives scholarships to middle and high school students in Shenandoah.

In 1997, the brothers were awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].  They were inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2001 and the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/the_everly_brothers.html |title=The Everly Brothers \xe2\x80\x93 Inductees \xe2\x80\x93 The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation|publisher=Vocal group|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref> Their contribution has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

They wrote "Till I Kissed You" (Don), "Cathy\'s Clown" (Don and Phil), and "When Will I Be Loved" (Phil). "Cathy\'s Clown" and "When Will I Be Loved" became hits for [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]], respectively (for the latter, the Everly Brothers sang the chorus){{citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Also, "Cathy\'s Clown" was covered by the legendary [[Tarney/Spencer Band]]. It was released as a single in 1979. Band member [[Alan Tarney]] (former member of [[The Shadows]]) went on to be a producer for "hit machines" like [[Cliff Richard]] and [[a-ha]], the [[Norway|Norwegian]] band who in turn covered "Crying In The Rain" in 1990 for its fourth album, \'\'East of The Sun, West of The Moon.\'\'

On Labor Day Weekend 1988, Central City Kentucky began the Everly Brothers Homecoming event to raise money for a scholarship fund for Muhlenberg County students. Don and Phil toured the United Kingdom in 2005, and Phil appeared in 2007 on recordings with Vince Gill and Bill Medley. Also in 2007, [[Alison Krauss]] and former [[Led Zeppelin]] frontman [[Robert Plant]] released \'\'[[Raising Sand]]\'\', which included a cover of the 1964 hit "Gone, Gone, Gone", produced by [[T-Bone Burnett]].

\'\'\'Firefall\'\'\' is a [[rock music|rock]] [[Band (music)|band]] that formed in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1974. It was founded by [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], who had been in [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], and [[Jock Bartley]], who had been [[Tommy Bolin]]\'s replacement in [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]]. The band\'s biggest hit single, "[[You Are the Woman]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the [[Billboard magazine|\'\'Billboard\'\' chart]]s in 1976.  Other hits included "[[Just Remember I Love You]]" (#11 in 1977), "Strange Way" (#11 in 1978), "Cinderella" (#34 in 1977), "Headed for a Fall" (#35 in 1980), and "Staying with It" (#37 in 1981) with female vocalist Lisa Nemzo.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1973 [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]] and [[Jock Bartley]] first crossed paths when Bartley was on tour with [[Gram Parsons]] as a member of his backing band The Fallen Angels. Both The Fallen Angels and Roberts were performing in [[New York City]] at the same venue on consecutive nights. After the two were reunited back in their native Colorado, Roberts was impressed by Bartley\'s guitar work and the duo soon began practicing together. Encouraged to form a band, they contacted [[bass guitar|bassist]]-[[singer]] [[Mark Andes]] (a former member of the bands [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] and [[Jo Jo Gunne]], who had temporarily retired to the mountains outside [[Boulder, Colorado]]), and [[Washington D.C.]] [[singer-songwriter|singer-songwriter-guitarist]] [[Larry Burnett]], whom Rick had met in his travels earlier that same year, and coaxed them into joining their band, which they christened Firefall in 1974.

Roberts took the name from the [[Yosemite Firefall]] (1872 to 1968), a summertime tradition of dumping a cascade of flaming embers off [[Glacier Point]] in California\'s [[Yosemite National Park]]. Guitarist/keyboardist Mark Hallman was another musician considered for Firefall but Hallman turned down the offer to stay with his band Navarro (Andes had briefly been a member as well), who went on to back up [[Carole King]]. According to a recent interview with www.glorydazemusic.com, Roberts originally had his name before the band\'s as Rick Roberts & Firefall. But Rick\'s name was soon dropped when he realized it was not enough of a marketing draw.
  
For the drum chair the group auditioned several local musicians but eventually decided, after a phone call from him, to add Roberts\' former band mate from [[Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], who was most famous for his time spent in the \'60s [[folk-rock]] band [[The Byrds]]. Clarke, who was now living in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], having recently returned from residing in [[Hawaii]], agreed to come aboard.

The band tightened up their act performing in clubs in [[Colorado]] for over a year, mainly in [[Boulder]] and [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]]. In early 1975 the band recorded a demo tape consisting of three songs produced by [[Chris Hillman]]. They then began taking it around to major labels, but were unsuccessful, at first.

=== Breakthrough and success ===

In 1975 Bartley, Andes and Roberts were brought into [[Chris Hillman]]\'s band. Before a scheduled performance at The Other End in NYC in June 1975, Hillman took ill and was unable to play the show or finish the tour. Burnett and Clarke were then flown in to complete the commitments. Atlantic A&R representatives (who had already heard the band\'s demo tape) saw the Other End show and quickly signed Firefall to a multi-album contract. During the summer, when the contract was signed, Roberts was out playing as a member of [[Stephen Stills]]\' band, so work on their first album was delayed until late 1975.

Just before the debut album\'s recording sessions at [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]], they brought in Roberts\' high school friend from [[Bradenton, Florida]], David Muse. Muse was a multi-instrumentalist who played the [[saxophone]], [[flute]], [[harmonica]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]. [[Jim Mason (producer)|Jim Mason]], who had worked with [[Poco]] in the past, was producer.

The album was recorded in one month and the result, the self-titled \'\'Firefall\'\', released in May 1976, became [[Atlantic Records]] quickest album to reach gold status. The group\'s first single, "Livin\' Ain\'t Livin\' ", stopped just short of the Top 40. In the following months, the band toured with artists such as [[Leon Russell|Leon]] and [[Mary Russell]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Roy Buchanan]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[The Band]] and were put on the bottom of a bill that featured [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] and [[Asleep at the Wheel]].
[[File:Firefall 1977.JPG|thumb|The group in 1977.]]
The band\'s next single, "[[You Are the Woman]]", made the Top 10 and the band began touring with [[Fleetwood Mac]], who were at the beginning of their commercial peak. Their next single, "Cinderella", though it reached the Top 40 and was played extensively on FM radio, did not fare as well on AM radio because of its controversial lyrics which caused feminist groups to pressure the stations to avoid playing it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} However, this did not have a lasting effect on the band\'s sales.

The group then headed back to Criteria Studios to record their second album, which was to be titled \'\'Tropical Nights\'\'. They were joined on these sessions by Cuban percussionist [[Joe Lala]] (ex-[[Manassas]], who\'d also played on their debut) and the [[Memphis Horns]]. But after hearing the final mix, Atlantic Records decided that the album needed to be reworked. With Jim Mason again at the helm, Firefall then redid several songs in L.A. and added some new ones. The album was renamed \'\'Luna Sea\'\' (pun: "lunacy") and released in July 1977. The revamped LP peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on the charts and went gold less than two months after release. The single from the album, "Just Remember I Love You", featuring backing vocals by future [[Eagles (band)|Eagle]] [[Timothy B. Schmit]], hit No.&nbsp;11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].

It was around this period that tensions were beginning to rise within the group, stemming from non-stop touring and management problems as well as alcohol and drug abuse. In recent interviews, both Rick and Larry have indicated that the group at this time was divided between the heavy substance users (Rick, Larry and Michael Clarke) and the other three (Bartley, Andes and Muse), who were a bit more in control of themselves. At this time the group was also incredibly popular and playing to sold-out crowds with Fleetwood Mac as part of their \'\'[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]\'\' tour. But this only delayed their disintegration for a short time.

In 1978 the band brought in producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with [[the Allman Brothers Band]] and [[Eric Clapton]], among many others, to produce their third album, \'\'Elan\'\', recording some at Criteria and some at L.A.\'s [[Record Plant]]. The band and Dowd got along well personally but they had conflicting musical visions. The differences were apparently noticeable enough that the band\'s new management, with help from their new friend [[Mick Fleetwood]], pressured the record label into letting them rework the album. This put the group in debt with the label, and within the year they parted ways with their new management. The production team of Ron and Howard Albert were brought in to finish the record. \'\'Elan\'\', released in October 1978, was a massive success, and it became their first album to reach platinum status. The hit single "Strange Way" continued the band\'s commercial hot streak.

=== Decline ===
After two years of non-stop recording and touring, the band was burned out and their financial situation was unstable.

Despite this, Atlantic Records still expected a new album. The band recorded the album sporadically over a year. The Alberts were again brought in to produce the album. But the band once again required a second effort, which was produced by [[Kyle Lehning]]. The result, titled \'\'[[Undertow (Firefall album)|Undertow]]\'\', was released in March 1980. This would be the last album with the original lineup. During a 1980 tour of Japan, Michael Clarke, due to his excessive drinking, missed gigs or showed up in no condition to play. The band resorted to hiring a German drummer, Dan Holsten, whose playing technique was similar to Clarke\'s, to sit in. Holsten, who even looked a lot like Clarke, had played in several other bands in the Colorado area and caught the eye of Jock and Larry one night at a [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] bar.  He became known as a \'reliable\' back-up drummer for tours and some studio work. Upon completion of the tour, Clarke and Mark Andes both left the band. Clarke later died of alcoholism at his Treasure Island home in Florida in December 1993.

Andes and Clarke were replaced by [[Kenny Loggins]]\' former rhythm section, consisting of bassist George Hawkins and drummer [[Tris Imboden]]. With the two new players, the band recorded \'\'Clouds Across the Sun\'\', which was released in December 1980 and spawned the early 1981 hit "Staying With It", which was done as a duet with singer Lisa Nemzo. Hawkins resigned from the group in late 1980 to join up with [[Mick Fleetwood\'s Zoo]], a side project the Fleetwood Mac drummer was recording in Africa. After Andes returned to guest for the group\'s February 1981 appearance on [[American Bandstand]], Kim Stone came in to take over bass. Everything seemed to be on track until Larry Burnett suddenly disappeared from the group after playing a show in [[Miami, Florida]] in April 1981 to return to his hometown of Washington D.C. to enter a rehab (Burnett eventually kicked a serious drug habit and after working in radio in the late 80s/early 90s, began pursuing a solo career in 2004). The group continued on to play their next show in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] without him. But after playing a concert with the band in [[Hawaii]] in August of that same year, Rick Roberts announced that he also was leaving for a solo career. With the band lacking personnel and increasing in financial debt, Atlantic dropped Firefall from their roster in 1981 and released \'\'Best of Firefall\'\' at the close of that year.

=== Resumption and later work ===
Unhappy with the way things had turned out, Jock Bartley decided to put together a new lineup in early 1982.
At Ron Albert\'s suggestion, Bartley got together with two Miami-based musicians, [[Johnne Sambataro]] (during the 70s and 80s, he adopted the conventional spelling of John for his first name) and Chuck Kirkpatrick.
Sambataro was a singer/guitarist/keyboardist/bassist/songwriter who had sung on record with [[Stephen Stills]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Mason]], [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]], the members of the [[Bee Gees]] and many others. Johnne and Jock had actually met back in 1978 when they both played on the Criteria sessions for [[Andy Gibb]]\'s platinum album \'\'Shadow Dancing\'\'. Kirkpatrick was a singer\xe2\x80\x93guitarist\xe2\x80\x93keyboardist who had sung with Johnne on a number of the aforementioned sessions and had worked as an engineer at Criteria on such albums as [[Derek & The Dominos]]\' \'\'Layla\'\'. Albert then brought in Alan Jacobi, a Miami entertainment lawyer who had a relationship with Atlantic, and Jacobi convinced the label to help resign the band. So in the spring of 1982, Criteria sessions for the \'\'Break of Dawn\'\' LP began with Ron and brother Howard producing once again. Backing Bartley, Sambataro and Kirkpatrick were a number of Miami session players, with Stephen Stills and Rick Roberts making guest appearances. The album appeared in September 1982 and Bartley, Johnne and Chuck began auditioning additional players for a follow-up tour. Chuck\'s brother Scott (a top-notch session drummer who, like Johnne, had also played on record and toured with McGuinn, Clark & Hillman) and Colorado bassist Greg Overton were chosen and, at the last minute, David Muse decided to rejoin the band.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the winter of 1983, Firefall set out across the U.S. to promote \'\'Break of Dawn\'\'. But the single from it, "Always", failed to reach the Top 40 and quickly fell off the charts.

\'\'Mirror of the World\'\' followed in November 1983, the title track a comment on the effects of TV violence on children. The album had a much harder edge than its predecessors, with more of an emphasis on an 80\'s style synth/drum programmed production, which many of the group\'s fans thought reflected too great a departure from the classic Firefall sound. Though the first single, the rocking "Runaway Love", written by Bartley, Sambataro and Paul Crosta, briefly appeared in a video on MTV and received limited radio airplay, this album too failed to attract sales and quickly disappeared.

The group, once again dropped by Atlantic, nevertheless continued to tour, headlining in smaller clubs and opening in larger venues for groups like the [[Beach Boys]], [[Little River Band]] and [[Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band]].

In 1983 Overton quit (he would return briefly to play a few shows with the group in [[Medford, Oregon]] in July 1986 as a fill-in) and Muse decided to retire from touring again. Steve Hadjoupolos (sax, flute, keyboards, and backing vocals) and Bob Gaffney (bass, vocals) were brought in and the group soldiered on. Sandy Ficca was brought in to take over from Scott Kirkpatrick on drums in October 1984 (Scott then returned to play some final shows with the band in June 1985 before moving on permanently) and is still with them to date.

On the evening of August 4, 1986, Chuck Kirkpatrick was leaving from a local club gig in the area of Florida where he resided. After breaking down on the road home, he was shot and wounded in the arm in a [[drive-by shooting]]; the shooter then fled the scene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The wound was serious enough to almost require amputation of Kirkpatrick\'s left arm, but doctors were able to save it and Chuck was able to play again after a very difficult rehab period. Many [[Miami]] musicians, including [[Jon Secada]] and members of the [[Miami Sound Machine]], came to Chuck\'s aid, playing a series of shows to help defray the cost of Chuck\'s medical care and rehab. Firefall brought in Colorado musician Mark Oblinger to sit in for Chuck until he was able to return to the band in November 1986. But Kirkpatrick\'s tenure in the band was coming to an end. In late 1987, Gaffney left and Eddie Gleason came on in the interim. Then Chuck left at the tail end of 1987 after differences with Jock Bartley. Oblinger (who\'d subbed for both Chuck and Gaffney in 1986) returned as Kirkpatrick\'s permanent replacement in December 1987 and Bil Hopkins was the new bassist. Dan Clawson (ex-[[Pure Prairie League]]) came in as well to take the place of Hadjoupolos in early 1988.

In 1989, after seven years in Firefall, Sambataro decided it was also time to say goodbye. This paved the way for the return of Rick Roberts and in September 1992, Rhino Records responded to the demand to put out Firefall music on CD by releasing \'\'Firefall: The Greatest Hits\'\', which featured all of the singles and AOR favorites and one new song, "Run Run Away", about adult victims of earlier child abuse.

In the early/mid 1990s, the personnel shuffles continued. Roberts, who was suffering from health problems, left again in mid-1992 to be replaced by Bruce Crichton, who turned it over to Steve Manshel in June 1993. Mark Oblinger departed as well and Steven Weinmeister came on board in May 1993. And after Dan Clawson left that same year, there were several people to occupy the woodwind\xe2\x80\x93keyboards chair, including Bray Ghiglia (1993\xe2\x80\x931994), the returning David Muse (1994\xe2\x80\x931995; 2000\xe2\x80\x932003; 2011-present), Jim Waddell (1993; 1995\xe2\x80\x9396; 1998\xe2\x80\x932000; 2003), Bob Fisher (1996\xe2\x80\x931998; 2007) and Chris Ball (2003\xe2\x80\x93present).

While touring in 1993, Firefall encountered the [[Flood of 1993]]. One of their gigs was canceled and a few had to be moved to higher ground. In response Jock wrote "When The River Rises", a song with an upbeat message of finding strength in adversity. The band recorded the song in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] at Startsong Recording Studio, with engineer\xe2\x80\x93programmer Tom Gregor co-producing with Bartley. "When The River Rises" was then brought back to St. Louis and played on the radio for the first time. At that point, the flood waters had still not crested. Vowing to donate a large portion of the publishing to flood relief, the song was sent to other radio stations in the flooded areas. It received heavy regional airplay and was also used by [[CNN]] and other TV stations behind coverage of the disaster.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

With the band\'s profile raised, the search for a new record deal began. Some smaller companies showed interest. They decided to go with an independent Colorado based label, Redstone Records, who\'d had some successes in the smooth jazz genre. \'\'Messenger\'\' was recorded in Denver and Boulder and was released in September 1994. Bartley had been stockpiling songs for ten years for just this opportunity. Along with the hard-edged "When The River Rises" and "Secret", his songs "Love Find A Way", "Very First Moment" (co-written with Rick Roberts) and "Who Ran Away" gave the album a familiar but updated Firefall sound.{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} Bil Hopkins\' song "Say It\'s Over" (written with Mark Oblinger) and Steve Manshel\'s "Innocent Victim" also appeared on the CD. Mark Andes and [[Richie Furay]] made guest appearances on the album and Jim Mason returned to the producer\'s chair. \'\'Messenger\'\' was much more diverse than anything the band had released to date with the usual love songs and ballads, but there were also songs about child abuse, environmental catastrophe and even sexual abuse/rape in the chilling "No Means No". The first single, "Love Find A Way", received some minor play on some stations, but Redstone didn\'t have the distribution clout to get the CD into all stores, so overall sales were disappointing. Some fans{{Who|date=January 2011}} hailed it as "their best record since the early days of Firefall" and this gave the group a new touring impetus.

Manshel, who\'d begun to take time off from the group to work on a solo album, left altogether in September 1999 to pursue his own career and the band reverted to a five-piece for the next fifteen years. Other than short-term fill-ins (Steve Jenks subbed for Hopkins in the spring and summer of 1998 and Gary Jones sat in for Weinmeister for a gig in November 1999 and one for Hopkins in June 2002), Bartley, Weinmeister, Hopkins and Sandy Ficca have continued on in Firefall until Hopkins left in 2014.

Since 2005, Firefall will sometimes play a handful of shows annually as "Acoustic Firefall" in various combinations, with the most common being the trio of Jock, Steve and Bil.

In September 2007, Firefall released a new CD, \'\'Colorado to Liverpool \xe2\x80\x93 A Tribute To The Beatles\'\' (http://www.firefall.com/beatles_tribute_cd.asp).

And on April 9, 2008, at Boulder Theater in [[Boulder, Colorado]], there was a Firefall reunion concert that featured the current lineup joined by Mark Andes, David Muse, Larry Burnett and original Firefall studio percussionist Joe Lala. Rick Roberts attended the show as well but was unable to perform with the others due to health issues. As previously mentioned, Michael Clarke had died in 1993. The reunion appeared as the CD \'\'Firefall Reunion Live\'\' in February 2009.

Since 2008, Jock\'s son, Jamey, sometimes guests with the band on drums and will fill in for Sandy Ficca on occasion.

Since the summer of 2011, David Muse, who just survived a bout with [[cancer]], has returned to play shows with Firefall once again, alternating with Chris Ball.

\'\'\'The Flying Burrito Brothers\'\'\' were<!-- See http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/plurals.htm See Talk Page --> an early [[country rock]] band, best known for their influential debut album, \'\'[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]\'\' (1969).<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-flying-burrito-brothers-p4284/biography The Flying Burrito Brothers | Music Biography, Credits and Discography]. AllMusic (1970-11-07). Retrieved on 2014-04-18.</ref> Although the group is most often mentioned in connection with country rock legends [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Chris Hillman]], the group underwent many personnel changes.

==Original line-up and members until 1972==
The Flying Burrito Brothers were founded in 1968 on the [[West Coast of the United States]] by former [[The Byrds|Byrds]] members [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Chris Hillman]],<ref>[http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spfbb1.html The Flying Burrito Brothers: 1967 - 1969]. Ebni.com (1998-05-13). Retrieved on 2014-04-18.</ref> as well as pianist and bassist [[Chris Ethridge]] and [[pedal steel guitar]]ist [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]]. The group borrowed their name from an East Coast-based group of the same name who had been colleagues of Parsons\' previous band, the [[International Submarine Band]].  The group recorded their debut album \'\'[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]\'\' without a regular drummer, although [["Fast" Eddie Hoh]] and Jon Corneal were both occasional full-time members during the early days of the band and both are featured on this album. The album contains originals by Parsons and Hillman, and two covers by [[soul music]] writers [[Dan Penn]] and [[Chips Moman]]. After firing Corneal the band needed a permanent drummer for touring purposes; they hired another ex-Byrd, [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], who had recently been working with the [[Dillard & Clark|Dillard and Clark Expedition]].

Although critically well received, \'\'The Gilded Palace of Sin\'\' did not sell well.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/72397-time-for-a-repress-the-gilded-palace-of-sin/ Time for a Repress: \xe2\x80\x98The Gilded Palace of Sin\xe2\x80\x99]. PopMatters. Retrieved on 2014-04-18.</ref> Ethridge departed in mid-1969, and Hillman moved to bass as the band hired singer and guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]]. The band performed at the [[Altamont Free Concert]] in December 1969, and, as documented in the film \'\'[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]\'\', the band was on stage when fights broke out in the audience.

Owing to disagreements between Parsons and Hillman, the band\'s next album, \'\'[[Burrito Deluxe]]\'\', included few collaborations between the pair. Parsons left the group after its release in May 1970.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=q-ET5tnh0MUC&pg=PA276&dq=%22The+Flying+Burrito+Brothers%22+-wikipedia&hl=en&ei=KzIKTcjCGoq3hQe1msSFDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Flying%20Burrito%20Brothers%22%20-wikipedia&f=false Icons of Rock: Elvis Presley ; Ray Charles; Chuck Berry ; Buddy Holly ; The ... - Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz - Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-18.</ref> A version of the group without Parsons appeared in June\xe2\x80\x93July 1970 on the [[Festival Express]] tour of Canada, documented in the film of the same name. Gram was later replaced by [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], with the new line-up releasing the self-titled album, \'\'[[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|The Flying Burrito Bros]]\'\', in 1971. Kleinow then left to become a session musician, and Leadon departed to create the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=M8p_WFCDe7AC&pg=PA75&dq=%22The+Flying+Burrito+Brothers%22+-wikipedia&hl=en&ei=KzIKTcjCGoq3hQe1msSFDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Flying%20Burrito%20Brothers%22%20-wikipedia&f=false Country - Richard Carlin, Barbara Ching - Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 2014-04-18.</ref> [[Al Perkins]] and [[Kenny Wertz]] replaced them, and Roger Bush and [[Byron Berline]] participated as guests in live performances, with the band releasing a live album, \'\'[[Last of the Red Hot Burritos]]\'\', in 1972.

The original band dissolved after the last founding member, Chris Hillman, took Perkins with him to join [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]]. Berline, Bush and Wertz continued with their own band, Country Gazette. Roberts assembled a makeshift Flying Burrito Bros group to fulfill contractual commitments for some 1973 European live shows, then initiated a solo career before forming [[Firefall]] with Michael Clarke.

==Later configurations==
As Gram Parsons\' influence and fame grew, so did interest in the Flying Burrito Brothers.  This new-found popularity led to the release of \'\'[[Close Up the Honky Tonks]]\'\' in 1974, a double-LP compilation of album tracks, B-sides, and out-takes.  Soon after in 1975, Kleinow and Ethridge put together a new incarnation of the band.  Parsons, for his part, had been asked in 1972 about the band continuing without him and remarked "The idea\'ll keep going on.  It\'s not like it\'s dead or anything.  Whether I do it or anybody else does it, it\'s got to keep going."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Flying Burrito Brothers|url=http://www.theflyingburritobrothers.net/blog.html|website=The Burrito Brothers|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>  [[Gib Guilbeau|Floyd "Gib" Gilbeau]], [[Joel Scott Hill]], and [[Gene Parsons]] (no relation to Gram) also joined the group, and the band released \'\'[[Flying Again]]\'\' that year. Ethridge was then replaced by [[Skip Battin]] for 1976\'s \'\'[[Airborne (The Flying Burrito Brothers album)|Airborne]].\'\'  Soon after, an album of previously unreleased early material, \'\'[[Sleepless Nights (Gram Parsons album)|Sleepless Nights]],\'\' was released credited to both Gram Parsons & The Flying Burrito Brothers.  The lineup continued to evolve for the rest of the 1970s with the band even releasing an album under the name Sierra while continuing to play shows as The Flying Burrito Brothers.  In 1980, they had a country hit with a version of [[Merle Haggard|Merle Haggard\'s]] "White Line Fever" from their [[Live In Tokyo (album)|Live In Tokyo]] live album of the previous year.

The early 1980s were a period of commercial success for the band that coincided with the band being known simply as "The Burrito Brothers."  Headed by songwriter and guitarist John Beland, Gib Guilbeau, and initially Sneaky Pete, the Burrito Brothers scored well on the country charts.  Skip Battin had remained with the band up until this point but left shortly before the release of 1981\'s [[Hearts On The Line]]  This marked the first significant commercial chart success the band ever had. In 1981 they received the [[Billboard Magazine]] award for "Best New Crossover Group" from pop to country. The Burrito Brothers continued to work with the top session players in Nashville and Los Angeles, logging up an impressive list of hit singles for Curb Records. In the 80\'s they toured Europe and were featured at the Albi Nashville Festival in [[Albi, France]], and performed with [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Tammy Wynette]] at London\'s [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Also in the early 1980s, the Burrito Brothers were responsible for a campaign that finally saw their idol, [[Lefty Frizzell]], inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].  In 1982, Sneaky Pete, the sole original member, departed prior to the release of [[Sunset Sundown]].  In 1984, Beland and Guilbeau retired the Burritos and afforded Sneaky Pete the chance to reform essentially the late 70\'s lineup with Skip Battin and Greg Harris that continued to tour and release live albums for the rest of the 80\'s.

In 1991 a lineup consisting of Beland, Guilbeau, Ethridge, Sneaky Pete, and Australian singer Brian Cadd began work on a new album, [[Eye of a Hurricane]].  The band went without a regular drummer and used session drummer Ron Tutt who had previously played with Elvis Presley.   The band soon parted ways with Ethridge for a third time and Cadd as well.  Ethridge was replaced by Larry Patton and Gary Kubal was added as a full-time drummer.  This lineup released California Jukebox in 1997.  At this time Gib Guilbeau and Sneaky Pete stopped working with the group due to health concerns.  Sneaky Pete was replaced by Wayne Bridges and the band released 1999\'s [[Sons of the Golden West]] which, while receiving solid critical reviews, would prove to be the final album by the Flying Burrito Brothers as John Beland decided to end the band shortly after the turn of the millennium.

Sneaky Pete then created a new Burrito project in 2002.  This band was called Burrito Deluxe due to John Beland still having rights to the original name.  This band featured Carlton Moody on lead vocals and [[Garth Hudson]] from [[The Band]] on keyboards. The first album of this incarnation, [[Georgia Peach (Burrito Deluxe Album)|Georgia Peach]] was conceived as a tribute to Gram Parsons.  Sneaky Pete left the band due to illness in 2005, leaving no direct lineage to any of the original 1969-1972 lineup.  His final recordings do appear, however, on their 2007 album [[Disciples of Truth (album)|Disciples of Truth]].  In 2010, an English record label owner named Del Taylor attempted to reactivate the band using any and all previous members he could find.  Bernie Leadon, Chris Ethridge, Al Perkins, and Gene Parsons all agreed if Chris Hillman would join.  Hillman was not interested in the project and instead took steps to acquire the rights to the "The Flying Burrito Brothers" so that he could retire the band once and for all.  His efforts were in vain, however.  As recently as 2011, a still-further evolution of the band, led by Walter Egan from Burrito Deluxe, released an album under the name "The Burritos" called [[Sound as Ever]].  Beginning in 2012, that band began playing shows under the name "The Burrito Brothers" before reclaiming "The Flying Burrito Brothers" as of 2014.<ref>[http://www.theflyingburritobrothers.net/index.html Home].

==Legacy==
Parsons died on September 19, 1973.  Clarke died in 1993, Battin died in 2003, Kleinow died in 2007, and Ethridge died in 2012.

Hillman remained a successful singer-songwriter, having been part of the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]] and McGuinn-Clark-Hillman, then going on to form the [[Desert Rose Band]] (1986\xe2\x80\x9393) with [[Herb Pedersen]]. He continued to sing with Pedersen as Chris and Herb, releasing \'\'The Other Side\'\' in 2005.

Guilbeau retired following heart surgery and moved to [[Palmdale, California]], from where he continued to appear occasionally at local functions in and around the Los Angeles area. Beland continued to produce acts in the USA and abroad, achieving hit records in both Australia and Norway, where he also performed as a solo act. Beland moved to [[Brenham, Texas]] and has written hits for performers such as [[The Whites]] with "Forever You", [[Mark Farner]] with "Isn\'t It Amazing?", and the [[Bellamy Brothers]] with "Cowboy Beat", "Hard Way To Make An Easy Living", and "Bound To Explode". His songs have been covered by many acts from [[Ricky Nelson]] to [[Garth Brooks]].

A Mexican restaurant in Gainesville, Florida, was named after the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://burritobros.com/who_we_are.htm|publisher=Burrito Bros Taco Company|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

A chain of Mexican restaurants in New Zealand was named after the band.

The [[role-playing game]] \'\'[[Kingdom of Loathing]]\'\' has a character named after the band.<ref name="The KoL Wiki">{{cite web|title=Brother Flying Burrito|url=http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Brother_Flying_Burrito|publisher=Kol.coldfront.net|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref>

Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref> helped establish the Southern rock genre in the early 1970s.<ref name=larkin />   While the band had reached the height of its commercial success by the end of the decade, the band has recorded and performed continuously under various lineups for nearly 40 years.<ref name=larkin>Colin Larkin (ed.), "Marshall Tucker Band." \'\'The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\'\', Vol. 5, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 521\xe2\x80\x93522.</ref>

The original lineup of the Marshall Tucker Band, formed in 1972, included lead guitarist, vocalist, and primary songwriter [[Toy Caldwell]] (1947\xe2\x80\x931993), lead vocalist [[Doug Gray]] (born 1948), keyboard player, saxophone player, and [[flautist]] [[Jerry Eubanks]] (born 1950), rhythm guitarist [[George McCorkle]] (1946\xe2\x80\x932007), drummer Paul Riddle (born 1953), and bassist [[Tommy Caldwell (musician)|Tommy Caldwell]] (1949\xe2\x80\x931980). They signed with [[Capricorn Records]] and in 1973 released their first [[long play|LP]], \'\'[[The Marshall Tucker Band (album)|The Marshall Tucker Band]]\'\'.

After Tommy Caldwell was killed in an automobile accident in 1980, he was replaced by bassist Franklin Wilkie.  Most of the original band members had left by the mid-1980s to pursue other projects.<ref name=olson>Ted Olson, "Marshall Tucker Band." \'\'The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music\'\' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 325\xe2\x80\x93326.</ref>  The band\'s current lineup consists of Gray on vocals, keyboard player and flautist Marcus James Henderson, guitarist Rick Willis, bassist Pat Elwood, and drummer B.B. Borden.<ref>[http://marshalltucker.com/nt-30-the-marshall-tucker-band-is.html The Marshall Tucker Band \xe2\x80\x93 Current and former members page]. 2009. Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

==Origin of the name==
The "Marshall Tucker" in the band\'s name does not refer to a band member, but rather a Spartanburg-area piano tuner.  While the band was discussing possible band names one evening in an old warehouse they had rented for rehearsal space, someone noticed that the warehouse\'s door key had the name "Marshall Tucker" inscribed on it, and suggested they call themselves the "The Marshall Tucker Band," not realizing it referred to an actual person.  It later came to light that Marshall Tucker, the blind piano tuner, had rented the space before the band, and his name was inscribed on the key.<ref name="bio"/> In his book, \'\'Top Pop Singles, 1955-2002\'\', music historian [[Joel Whitburn]] attributes "Marshall Tucker" to the owner of the band\'s rehearsal hall.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89820-155-1}}</ref>

==History==

===Early history===
The original members (and some later members) of the Marshall Tucker Band had been playing in various lineups under different band names around the Spartanburg area since the early 1960s.  In 1966, members of several such bands merged to form the Toy Factory, named after guitarist Toy Caldwell.  The Toy Factory\'s constantly shifting lineup included, at times, Caldwell, his younger brother Tommy, Doug Gray, Jerry Eubanks, George McCorkle, and Franklin Wilkie.  In the late 1960s, four of the bandmembers served in the U.S. Armed Forces;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgemccorkle.com/Bio.htm|title=GEORGE MCCORKLE|publisher=georgemccorkle.com|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marshall Tucker Band to Entertain Troops in Iraq & Kuwait|author=Ryan|date=May 4, 2011|publisher=marshalltucker.com|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marshalltucker.com/articlesby-382|title=Marines salute Hutchings, Caldwells|author=Dudley Brown|date=Jun 29, 2003|work==Spartanburg Herald-Journal|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref> Toy Caldwell was wounded in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/26/arts/toy-caldwell-jr-45-a-founder-of-the-marshall-tucker-band.html|title=Toy Caldwell Jr., 45, a Founder of the Marshall Tucker Band|date=February 26, 1993|work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>

By the 1970s, Toy Caldwell and George McCorkle had returned to Spartanburg, and the Toy Factory had resumed playing in area clubs.<ref name=smith>Michael B. Smith, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/toy_bio.htm Toy Caldwell\'s Carolina Dreams].  Tuckerhead.com.  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>  In fact, in 1970 the Toy Factory was the opening act for the Allman Brothers when the Allmans played at the "Sitar" music lounge in Spartanburg.

In 1972, Caldwell and McCorkle once again revamped the band\'s lineup, eventually settling on Tommy Caldwell on bass, George McCorkle rhythm guitar, and Jerry Eubanks, flute/tenor sax, while adding Paul Riddle on drums; the new lineup adopted the name "Marshall Tucker Band." Wet Willie lead singer Jimmy Hall told Toy Caldwell to book the band at Grant\'s Lounge in Macon which he did. After hearing the band play at Grant\'s Buddy Thornton and Paul Hornsby recorded the band\'s [[demo (music)|demo]] at [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn Studios]] in Macon, Ga.  [[Frank Fenter]] and [[Phil Walden]] signed The Marshall Tucker Band based on those demos.

===1970s===
The Marshall Tucker Band\'s [[The Marshall Tucker Band (album)|self-titled debut]], produced by [[Paul Hornsby]], was released in 1973, and certified gold in 1975.<ref name=elliott>James Elliott, "Marshall Tucker Band." \'\'Definitive Country: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Country Music and its Performers\'\' (New York: Berkley Publishing Group, 1995), pp. 504-505.</ref> All of the tracks were written by Toy Caldwell, including "[[Can\'t You See (The Marshall Tucker Band song)|Can\'t You See]]", which was released in 1973 on Capricorn 0023 ("Bubbled Under" at No.&nbsp;108 on 1 September 1973) and re-released in 1977 on Capricorn 0278 (peaked at No.&nbsp;75 on 24 September 1977). After the album\'s release, the band began touring, playing upwards of 300 shows per year throughout the decade.<ref name=elliott /> Southern rock fiddler [[Charlie Daniels]] later recalled that the Marshall Tucker Band "came onstage and just blew it out from start to finish."<ref name=alfonso>Barry Alfonso, Notes to \'\'The Marshall Tucker Band: Anthology\'\' [CD liner notes]. Ramblin\' Records, 2005.</ref>

Daniels\' first of many collaborations with the Marshall Tucker Band came on the band\'s second album, \'\'[[A New Life (album)|A New Life]]\'\',<ref name=alfonso /> which was released in 1974, and certified gold in 1977.<ref name=elliott />  Daniels and blues guitarist [[Elvin Bishop]] were among several musicians that joined the band for \'\'[[Where We All Belong]]\'\',<ref name=alfonso /> a double-album (one studio album and one live album) released by the band in 1974 and certified gold that same year.  The following year the band\'s \'\'[[Searchin\' for a Rainbow]]\'\' was also certified gold the year of its release, and contained the track "Fire on the Mountain," which peaked at No.&nbsp;38 on the [[Billboard charts]]. \'\'[[Long Hard Ride]]\'\', the band\'s fifth consecutive gold album, was released in 1976,<ref name=alfonso /> and its instrumental title track (which again features Charlie Daniels on fiddle) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].<ref name=cortner>Amy Cortner, "Marshall Tucker Band." \'\'Encyclopedia of Appalachia\'\' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006). p. 1186.</ref>  \'\'[[Carolina Dreams]]\'\', released in 1977 and certified platinum that same year, proved to be the band\'s most commercially successful album, and included the track "Heard It In a Love Song," which reached No.&nbsp;14 on the Billboard charts.<ref name=elliott />  The band\'s final Capricorn release came with 1978\'s \'\'[[Together Forever (The Marshall Tucker Band album)|Together Forever]]\'\', which was produced by [[Stewart Levine]].<ref name=alfonso /> Following the bankruptcy of Capricorn, The Marshall Tucker Band moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]] for their ninth album, \'\'[[Running Like the Wind]]\'\' (the band\'s eighth release was a compilation album entitled \'\'Greatest Hits\'\'), and they retained Levine as the album\'s producer.

===1980s===
Following the completion of the band\'s tenth album, entitled \'\'Tenth\'\', tragedy struck The Marshall Tucker Band. On April 22, 1980, the band\'s bassist and co-founder, Tommy Caldwell, suffered massive head trauma in a car wreck, and died six days later. Former Toy Factory bassist Franklin Wilkie replaced Caldwell, but the band was never able to recapture its commercial success of the 1970s. On 1982\'s \'\'Tuckerized\'\', only two songs were written by band members; \'Sea, Dreams & Fairy Tales\' by Toy Caldwell and \'Sweet Elaine\' by George McCorkle. Main songwriter Toy Caldwell only contributed three songs to each of the two albums released in 1983; \'\'Just Us\'\' and \'\'Greetings from South Carolina\'\'. After 1983\'s \'\'Greetings from South Carolina\'\', all the rest of the original band members split, sans Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks.<ref name=larkin />

In 1988 Gray and Eubanks recorded the album \'\'Still Holdin\' On\'\', their one and only release on the Mercury Records label. Although Gray and Eubanks added new members Rusty Milner, Stuart Swanlund, and Tim Lawter, \'\'Still Holdin\' On\'\' was primarily recorded with studio musicians. The newer members had a much greater role, however, on the band\'s 1990 album, \'\'Southern Spirit\'\', released on the Sisaspa label. The album marked a return to the band\'s country and blues roots.<ref name=tuckerhead>Tuckerhead.com, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/still_holdin_on_review.htm \'\'Still Holdin\' On\'\' Review]. 2002\xe2\x80\x932008. Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref>

===1990s===
In 1992, the Marshall Tucker Band produced its first album for the Cabin Fever label, \'\'Still Smokin\'\'\', which managed to crack the top 70 on the Billboard charts. The band\'s 1993 release, \'\'Walk Outside the Lines\'\', marked a transition to a more country sound, relying less on long improvised jams that were the trademark of the band\'s early career.<ref>Craig Cumberland, [http://www.tuckerhead.com/walk_review.htm \'\'Walk Outside the Lines\'\' Review].  Retrieved: 9 June 2009.</ref> The album\'s title track was co-written by country music star [[Garth Brooks]], a long-time fan of the band who considered writing a track for them a "milestone" in his career.<ref name=elliott />

For 1998\'s \'\'Face Down In the Blues\'\', the band added Spartanburg-area guitarist Ronald Radford and multi-instrumentalist David Muse, the latter replacing Jerry Eubanks, who had retired in 1996.<ref name=alfonso /> \'\'Gospel\'\', the band\'s 1999 album, featured the band\'s rendition of traditional songs such as [[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|The Wayfaring Stranger]] and [[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]], and several original tracks.

===Recent history===
The Marshall Tucker Band continued recording and performing into the 21st century, playing between 150 and 200 shows per year.<ref name=bio /> The band reissued many of its albums from the 1970s on its new Ramblin\' Records label, as well as two two-disc compilations, the first (\'\'Anthology\'\') being a 30-year retrospective and the second (\'\'Where a Country Boy Belongs\'\') being a collection of the band\'s country songs. In 2004, they released another studio album, \'\'Beyond the Horizon\'\', and the following year released a Christmas album, \'\'Carolina Christmas\'\'.

\'\'Can\'t You See\'\' was used for the opening and closing credits of the [[Kevin Costner]] 2008 motion picture \'\'[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]\'\'. \'\'Take the Highway\'\' was also used in the movie.

"Can\'t You See" is also used in the 2001 film \'\'[[Blow (film)|Blow]]\'\'. Blow is a 2001 American biopic about the American cocaine smuggler George Jung, directed by Ted Demme. [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] and [[Nick Cassavetes]] adapted Bruce Porter\'s 1993 book Blow: How a Small Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medell\xc3\xadn Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All.

The band was mentioned in the [[Florida Georgia Line]] song \'\'[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]\'\', which peaked at #16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]], and spawned a remix featuring rapper [[Nelly (rapper)|Nelly]] which peaked at #6 on the Hot 100. \'\'Cruise\'\' was certified 6x-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], becoming the second-highest selling song in country music history, behind [[Lady Antebellum]]\'s \'\'[[Need You Now (song)|Need You Now]]\'\'.

</ref> Older brother Terry\'s "Two Hangmen" from their first album \'\'Wanted... Mason Proffit,\'\' became a regional hit and helped their second album, \'\'Movin\' Toward Happiness,\'\' chart on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]]. In 1972, the band signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and continued touring, performing up to 300 concerts each year. Some of Mason Proffit\'s opening acts during that time included [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Steely Dan]], [[John Denver]], and [[Mac Davis]]. Their country-rock-bluegrass style was innovative yet difficult to place in a marketing genre. Their live shows were high energy. And once, while jamming with The Scruggs Review, [[John Hartford]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Earl Scruggs]] called John Talbot "the best banjo player I\'ve ever heard." Warner Bros. re-released their first two albums as a compilation called \'\'Come And Gone\'\' plus two more discs, \'\'Rockfish Crossing\'\' and \'\'Bareback Rider\'\'. Mason Proffit disbanded when brothers John and Terry Talbot left the band and began performing as a duo. Warners then released \'\'The Talbot Bros.\'\', the first of three duo albums with the remaining two released on Sparrow Records. Sparrow eventually re-issued the first Talbot Bros. album, minus the track "Moline Truckin."

After the break-up, the Talbot brothers began to record [[contemporary Christian music]] on [[Sparrow Records]], earning themselves a [[Grammy Award]] nomination and several [[Dove Award]] nominations. The Talbot brothers opened for [[The Eagles]] on a national tour.

\'\'\'Robert Michael Nesmith\'\'\' (born December 30, 1942) is an American musician, songwriter, actor, producer, novelist, businessman, and philanthropist, best known as a member of the pop rock band [[the Monkees]] and co-star of the TV series \'\'[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]\'\' (1966\xe2\x80\x931968). Nesmith is a songwriter, including "[[Different Drum]]" (sung by [[Linda Ronstadt]] with the [[Stone Poneys]]), and executive producer of the [[cult film]] \'\'[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]\'\' (1984). In 1981, Nesmith won the first [[Grammy Award]] given for Video of the Year for his hour-long television show, \'\'[[Elephant Parts]]\'\'.<ref>http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&field_nominee_work_value=&year=1981&genre=18</ref>

==Biography==
Nesmith was born in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1942.<ref>[http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&db=TXbirthindex%2c&rank=0&tips=0&gsfn=Robert&gsln=Nesmith&sx=&gs1co=2%2cUSA&gs1pl=46%2cTexas&year=&yearend=&sbo=0&sbor=&ufr=0&wp=4%3b_80000002%3b_80000003&srchb=r&prox=1&ti=0&ti.si=0&gss=angs-d&o_iid=21416&o_lid=21416&o_it=21416&fh=13&recid=11279092&recoff=1+3 Texas Birth Index 1903\xe2\x80\x9397] showing : "Robert Michael Nesmith, born December 30, 1942, Harris County, father Warren Audrey Nesmith, mother Bette Clair McMurray.
]</ref>
He was an only child; his parents, Warren Audrey Nesmith and [[Bette Nesmith Graham]], divorced when their son was four. He and his mother moved to Dallas to be closer to her parents, sister, aunts and grandmother. Bette took temporary jobs ranging from clerical work to graphics design, and developed very good secretarial skills, including shorthand and, auspiciously, touch typing. When Nesmith was 13, his mother invented a typewriter [[correction fluid]] later known commercially as [[Liquid Paper]]. Over the next 25 years she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into a multimillion dollar international company, which she finally sold to [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] in 1979 for US$48 million. She died a few months later at age 56.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.women-inventors.com/Bette-Nesmith-Graham.asp |title=Bette Nesmith Graham: Liquid Paper Inventor |publisher=Women-inventors.com |date= |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref>

Nesmith was enrolled in the Dallas public school system in 1949, at the age of six. Describing himself as an indifferent student, he nevertheless participated in choral and drama activities during his years at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in [[Dallas]].<ref name="rhino">[http://monkees.rhino.com/read/mike.lasso \'\'The Monkees: Mike Nesmith\'\'] biography from [[Rhino Records]]</ref> He also began to write verse poetry. When he was 15 he enrolled in the Dallas Theater Center teen program, where he was  featured in several plays.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

Without graduating from high school, Nesmith enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] in 1960. He completed basic training at [[Lackland Air Force Base]] in San Antonio, was trained as an aircraft mechanic at [[Sheppard Air Force Base]] in Wichita Falls, Texas, and then was permanently stationed at a [[Strategic Air Command]] base near [[Elk City, Oklahoma]]. While in the Air Force, Nesmith obtained a [[General Educational Development|G.E.D.]] and was discharged under honorable conditions in 1962. He enrolled in [[San Antonio College]], a community college, where he met John Kuehne (later to be known as [[John London]]) and began a musical collaboration. The duo won the first [[San Antonio College]] talent award, performing a mixture of standard folk songs and a few of Nesmith\'s original songs. He met another SAC student, Phyllis Ann Barbour, whom he later married.<ref>National Enquirer, February 26, 2010</ref>

While in college, Nesmith began to write more songs and poetry, and after he and Phyllis married in 1963, the two of them decided to move to Los Angeles so Nesmith could pursue his songwriting and singing career. At the time, Phyllis was pregnant with their first child, [[Christian Nesmith|Christian DuVal]]. Nesmith began singing in folk clubs around Los Angeles and had one notable job as the "Hootmaster" for the Monday night [[hootenanny|hootenannie]]s at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]], a West Hollywood night club that featured new artists. Here Nesmith met, socialized, and performed with many different members of the burgeoning new L.A. music scene. [[Randy Sparks]] from the [[New Christy Minstrels]] offered Nesmith a publishing deal for his songs, and it was while Nesmith was at this publishing house that Barry Friedman, also known as the Rev. [[Frazier Mohawk]], brought the ad for [[The Monkees (TV series)|\'\'The Monkees\'\' TV series]] auditions to Nesmith\'s attention. In October 1965, Nesmith landed the role as guitar player "Mike" in [[The Monkees (TV series)|\'\'The Monkees\'\' TV series]], which required real-life musical talent (writing, instrument playing, singing, recording, and performing in live concerts as part of [[The Monkees]] musical band). \'\'The Monkees\'\' television series aired from 1966 until 1968 and has developed a cult following over the years.<ref>Sandoval, Andrew.  \'\'Music Box Liner Notes:  The True Story of "The Monkees"\'\', Rhino Records, 2001</ref>

When \'\'The Monkees\'\' TV series ended in 1968, Nesmith enrolled part-time at UCLA and studied American History and Music History. Michael and Phyllis\'s second son, Jonathan, was born in February 1968. Nesmith\'s third son, Jason, was born in August 1968 to [[Nurit Wilde]], whom he met while working on \'\'The Monkees\'\' TV series.<ref>Harvey Kubernik, Scott Calamar, Diltz, Henry, Lou Adler, \'\'Canyon of Dreams: The Magic and the Music of Laurel Canyon\'\' ([[Sterling Publishing]], 2009), ISBN 978-1-4027-6589-6, p. 95. [http://books.google.com/books?id=bANZjtz2qUkC&q=nurit#v=snippet&q=nurit&f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].</ref> In 1969, Nesmith formed the group [[First National Band]] with Kuehne, John Ware and Red Rhodes. Nesmith wrote most of the songs for the band, including a single titled "Joanne" that received some airplay and was a moderate chart hit for seven weeks during 1970, rising to number 21 on the Billboard Top 40.<ref>Joel Whitburn, \'\'The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\'\', p. 330 (5th ed. 1992).</ref> The First National Band has been credited with being among the pioneers of country-rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.real.com/music/artist/Michael_Nesmith/ |title=Michael Nesmith - Country Rock - Rock/Pop - Music - www.real.com |publisher=Uk.real.com |accessdate=May 14, 2010}}</ref>

Phyllis\'s third child, and Nesmith\'s fourth, daughter Jessica, was born in September 1970. Circa 1972, Nesmith started the record label Countryside Records with [[Jac Holzman]], the founder of [[Elektra Records]]. Also, in 1972, Nesmith and Phyllis were divorced and he moved to [[Carmel, California]]. In 1974, Nesmith started [[Pacific Arts Corporation|Pacific Arts Records]] and released what he called "a book with a soundtrack," titled \'\'The Prison\'\', as the company\'s first release. In 1976, he married Kathryn Bild. In 1988, following the ending of this second marriage, he returned to Los Angeles where he met Victoria Kennedy. They moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in 1992 and then returned to Carmel, California, in 2000. They were married in April 2000 in [[Monterey, California]]. They separated in 2011 and Kennedy filed for divorce.<ref>The Mirror (UK), March 5, 2011</ref>

==Career==
After a tour of duty in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother and stepfather. Learning as he went, he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing [[folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], and occasionally [[rock and roll]]. His verse poems became the basis for song lyrics, and after moving to Los Angeles with Phyllis and friend [[John London]], he signed a publishing deal for his songs. Nesmith\'s [[Mary, Mary (song)|"Mary, Mary"]] was recorded by the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], while "[[Different Drum]]" and "Some of Shelly\'s Blues" were recorded by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and the [[Stone Poneys]]. "Pretty Little Princess," written in 1965, was recorded by [[Frankie Laine]] and released as a single in 1968 on [[ABC Records]]. Later, "Some of Shelly\'s Blues" and "Propinquity (I\'ve Just Begun to Care)" were made popular by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their 1970 album \'\'[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]\'\'.

Nesmith began his recording career in 1963 by releasing a single on the Highness label. He followed this in 1965 with a one-off single released on Edan Records followed by two more recorded singles; one was titled "The New Recruit" under the name "Michael Blessing," released on [[Colpix Records]], coincidentally also the label of [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]], though they did not meet until [[The Monkees]] formed.

===The Monkees===
[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Nesmith (center) with [[The Monkees]] in 1967]]
From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band [[The Monkees]], created for the television [[The Monkees (TV series)|situation comedy of the same name]]. The only Monkee to learn of the audition from the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys," Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blas\xc3\xa9 when he auditioned. He further distinguished himself by carrying a bag of laundry to be done on the way home, and wearing a [[tuque|wool hat]] to keep his hair out of his eyes, riding his motorcycle to the audition. Producers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back.

Once he was cast, [[Screen Gems]] bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for The Monkees, such as "The Girl I Knew Somewhere," "Mary, Mary," and "Listen to the Band" became minor hits. One song he wrote, "You Just May Be the One," is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.

The [[Gretsch]] guitar company built a one-off natural finish 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with The Monkees (Gretsch had a promotional deal with the group).<ref>The custom-made guitar was frequently cited at that time as being worth $5,000 (the equivalent of over $30,000 in 2008 dollars), which was undoubtedly inflated for publicity purposes.</ref> He earlier played a customized Gretsch twelve-string, which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as The Monkees\' live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968, Nesmith used a white 6-string Gibson SG for his live appearances with The Monkees. He would use that guitar in their motion picture \'\'[[head (film)|Head]]\'\' for the live version of "Circle Sky," and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969 with Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s.

As with the other Monkees, Nesmith came to be frustrated by the manufactured image of the whole project. Although he was permitted to write and produce two songs per album and his music was frequently featured in episodes of the series. Nesmith was the most publicly vocal about the Monkees prefabricated image. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Monkees succeeded in ousting supervisor [[Don Kirshner]] (with Nesmith punching a hole in a wall to make a point with Kirshner and attorney Herb Moelis) and took control of their records and song choices, but they worked as a four-man group on only one album, 1967\'s \'\'[[Headquarters (album)|Headquarters]]\'\'. The band never overcame the credibility problems they faced when word spread that they had not played on their first records; Nesmith instigated this when he called the band\'s first non-studio press conference and called \'\'[[More of The Monkees]]\'\' "probably the worst record in the history of the world". However, their singles and albums continued to sell well, until the disastrous release of \'\'[[Head (film)|Head]]\'\'.

Nesmith\'s last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Nerf]] balls, in April 1970 (fittingly, the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, "Enerf\'s enerf!"). With the band\'s fortunes continuing to fall, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, and had to pay a default: "I had three years left... at $150,000 a year," which he had to pay back. He continued to feel the financial bite for years afterwards, until his inheritance from his mother\'s Liquid Paper fortune in 1980 eased those concerns. In a 1980 interview with \'\'[[Playboy]]\'\' he said of that time, "I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture." While Nesmith had continued to produce his compositions with the Monkees, he withheld many of the songs from the final Monkees albums, only to release them on his post-Monkees solo records.

====Return to the Monkees====
[[File:Michael Nesmith 2012.jpg|thumb|220px|Nesmith playing with The Monkees at the Chicago Theater, 2012]]
Nesmith did not participate in the Monkees\' 20th anniversary reunion. However, he did appear during an encore with the other three members at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] on September 7, 1986. In a 1987 interview for [[Nick Rocks]], Nesmith stated, "When Peter called up and said \'we\'re going to go out, do you want to go?\' I was booked. But, if you get to L.A ... I\'ll play."<ref>Nick Rocks, January 1987 Profile of Michael Nesmith</ref>  {{Quote box

Nesmith appeared again in 1989 with [[Micky Dolenz|Dolenz]], [[Peter Tork|Tork]], and [[Davy Jones (musician)|Jones]] when the Monkees received a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] Star.

In 1995, Nesmith was again reunited with the Monkees to record their last studio album (and first to feature all four since \'\'[[Head (The Monkees album)|Head]]\'\'), entitled \'\'[[Justus (album)|Justus]]\'\', released in 1996. He also wrote and directed a Monkees television special entitled \'\'[[Hey, Hey, It\'s the Monkees]]\'\'. To support the reunion, Nesmith, Jones, Dolenz, and Tork briefly toured the UK in 1997.  The UK tour was the last appearance of all four Monkees performing together.

In 2012, 2013, and 2014 Nesmith reunited with Dolenz and Tork to perform concerts throughout the United States.  Backed with a 7-piece band that included Nesmith\'s son, Christian,<ref>Dickinson, Chrissie, "A fresh and electric look back from 3 Monkees", Chicago Tribune, November 17, 2012</ref> the trio performed 27 songs from [[The Monkees discography]] ("[[Daydream Believer]]" was sung by the audience and played by the band).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2012/11/set-list-monkees-open-reunion-tour.html |title=VVN Music: Set List: Monkees Open Reunion Tour @ Escondido, CA |publisher=Vintagevinylnews.com |date=2012-11-10 |accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref> When asked why he had decided to return to the Monkees, Nesmith stated, "I never really left. It is a part of my youth that is always active in my thoughts and part of my overall work as an artist. It stays in a special place."<ref>Green, Andy, "Q&A: Michael Nesmith on His Surprising Return to the Monkees", Rolling Stones Magazine, August 8, 2012</ref>

==Solo career==
As he prepared for his exit from The Monkees in 1970, Nesmith was approached by John Ware of The Corvettes, a band that featured Nesmith\'s friend John London, who played on some of the earliest pre-Monkees Nesmith 45s as well as numerous Monkees sessions, and had 45s produced by Nesmith for the [[Dot Records|Dot label]] in 1969. Ware wanted Nesmith to put together a band. Nesmith said he would be interested only if noted [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player [[Red Rhodes|Orville "Red" Rhodes]] was part of the project; Nesmith\'s musical partnership with Rhodes continued until Rhodes\'s death in 1995. The new band was christened Michael Nesmith and the [[First National Band]] and went on to record three albums for [[RCA Records]] in 1970.

Nesmith has been considered one of the pioneers of [[country rock]].<ref>[[Liner notes]] from the CD \'\'Hillbilly Fever, Volume 5\'\' released by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 1995.</ref> He also had moderate commercial success with the First National Band. Their second single, "[[Joanne (song)|Joanne]]," hit No.&nbsp;21 on the Billboard chart and No.&nbsp;17 on Cashbox, with the follow-up "Silver Moon" making No.&nbsp;42 Billboard and No.&nbsp;28 Cashbox. Two more singles charted ("Nevada Fighter" made No.&nbsp;70 Billboard/No.&nbsp;73 Cashbox, and "Propinquity" reached No.&nbsp;95 Cashbox), and the first two LPs charted in the lower regions of the Billboard album chart. No clear answer has ever been given for the band\'s breakup.

Nesmith followed up with The Second National Band, a band that, besides Nesmith, consisted of Michael Cohen (keyboards and [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]]), Johnny Meeks (bass), jazzer Jack Ranelli (drums), and Orville Rhodes (pedal steel), as well as an appearance by singer, musician, and songwriter [[Jos\xc3\xa9 Feliciano]] on congas. The album, \'\'[[Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1]]\'\', was a commercial and critical disaster. Nesmith then recorded \'\'[[And the Hits Just Keep on Comin\']]\'\', featuring only him on guitar and Red Rhodes on pedal steel.

Nesmith became more heavily involved in producing, working on [[Iain Matthews]]\'s album \'\'[[Valley Hi]]\'\' and [[Bert Jansch]]\'s \'\'[[L.A. Turnaround]]\'\'. Nesmith was given a label of his own, Countryside, through Elektra Records, as Elektra\'s Jac Holzman was a fan of Nesmith. It featured a number of artists produced by Nesmith, including Garland Frady and [[Red Rhodes]]. The staff band at Countryside also helped Nesmith on his next, and last, RCA album, \'\'Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash\'\'.  Countryside folded when David Geffen replaced Holzman, rendering Countryside unnecessary in Geffen\'s eyes.

In the mid-1970s, Nesmith briefly collaborated as a songwriter with [[Linda Hargrove (songwriter)|Linda Hargrove]], resulting in the tune "[[I\'ve Never Loved Anyone More]]", a hit for [[Lynn Anderson]] and recorded by many others, as well as the songs "Winonah" and "If You Will Walk With Me," both of which were recorded by Hargrove. Of these songs, only "Winonah" was recorded by Nesmith himself. During this same period, Nesmith started his multimedia company Pacific Arts, which initially put out audio records, [[8-track tape|8-track]]s and cassettes, followed in 1981 with "video records."  Nesmith recorded a number of LPs for his label, and had a moderate worldwide hit in 1977 with his song "Rio," the single taken from the album \'\'From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing\'\'. In 1983, Nesmith produced the music video for the [[Lionel Richie]] single "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long]]". In 1987, he produced the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] single "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]".

===\'\'PopClips\'\' and MTV, \'\'Elephant Parts\'\' and \'\'Television Parts\'\'===
{{further2|[[PopClips]]}}

During this time, Nesmith created a video-clip for "Rio" which helped spur Nesmith\'s creation of a television program called \'\'[[PopClips]]\'\' for the [[Nickelodeon]] cable network. In 1980, \'\'PopClips\'\' was sold to the [[Time Warner]]/[[American Express|Amex]] consortium. Time Warner/Amex developed \'\'PopClips\'\' into the MTV network.

Nesmith won the first-ever [[Grammy Award for Video of the Year|Grammy Award]] given for (Long-form) [[Grammy Award for Video of the Year|Music-Video]] in 1982, for his hour-long \'\'[[Elephant Parts]]\'\' and also had a short-lived series on NBC inspired by the video called \'\'[[Television Parts|Michael Nesmith in Television Parts]]\'\'. \'\'Television Parts\'\' included many other artists who were unknown at the time but went on to become major stars in their own right. [[Jay Leno]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Arsenio Hall]] all became well-known artists after their appearances on Nesmith\'s show. The concept of the show was to have comics render their stand-up routines into short comedy films much like the ones in \'\'Elephant Parts\'\'. Nesmith assembled writers [[Jack Handey]], [[William E. Martin|William Martin]], John Levenstein, and Michael Kaplan, along with directors [[William Dear]] (who had directed \'\'Elephant Parts\'\') and Alan Myerson, as well as producer Ward Sylvester to create the show. The half-hour show ran for eight episodes in the summer of 1985 on NBC Thursday nights in prime time.

===Pacific Arts and legal dispute===
{{further2|[[Pacific Arts Corporation]]}}

[[Pacific Arts Corporation|Pacific Arts Video]] became a pioneer in the [[home video]] market, producing and distributing a wide variety of videotaped programs, although the company eventually ceased operations after an acrimonious contract dispute with [[PBS]] over home video licensing rights and payments for several series, including [[Ken Burns]]\' \'\'[[The Civil War (documentary)|The Civil War]]\'\'. The dispute escalated into a lawsuit that went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles. On February 3, 1999, a jury awarded Nesmith and his company Pacific Arts $48.875&nbsp;million in [[compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]], prompting his widely quoted comment, "It\'s like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. You\'re happy to get your stereo back, but it\'s sad to find out your grandmother is a thief." PBS appealed the ruling, but the appeal never reached court and a settlement was reached, with the amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith results kept confidential.

Nesmith\'s current Pacific Arts project is Videoranch 3D, a virtual environment on the internet that hosts live performances at various virtual venues inside the Ranch. He performed live inside Videoranch 3D on May 25, 2009.

===Movies and books===
Nesmith was the executive producer for the films \'\'[[Repo Man (1984 film)|Repo Man]]\'\', \'\'[[Tapeheads]]\'\', and \'\'[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]\'\', as well as his own solo recording and film projects.

In 1998, Nesmith published his first novel, \'\'The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora\'\'. It was developed originally as an online project and was later published as a hard cover book by St Martin\'s Press. Nesmith\'s second novel \'\'The America Gene\'\' was released in July 2009 as an online download from Videoranch.com.

===Recent history===
In the early 1980s, Nesmith teamed up with satirist [[P.J. O\'Rourke]] to ride his vehicle \'\'Timerider\'\' in the annual [[Baja 1000]] off-road race. This is chronicled in O\'Rourke\'s 2009 book \'\'[[Driving Like Crazy]]\'\'.

During the 1990s, Nesmith, as Trustee and President of the Gihon foundation, hosted the Council on Ideas, a gathering of intellectuals from different fields who were asked to identify the most important issues of their day and publish the result. The Gihon ceased the program in 2000 and started a new Program for the Performing Arts. Nesmith also spent a decade as a board of trustees member, nominating member and vice-chair of the [[American Film Institute]].

In 1992, Nesmith undertook a concert tour of North America to promote the CD release of his RCA solo albums (although he included the song "Rio", from the album \'\'[[From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing]]\'\'). The concert tour ended at the Britt Festival in Oregon. A video and CD, both entitled \'\'[[Live at the Britt Festival]]\'\' were released capturing the 1992 concert.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Aktkbikzhbb89 Allmusic ((( Live at the Britt Festival [Video/DVD&#93; > Overview )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[File:Chris Scruggs and Michael Nesmith.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Michael Nesmith performing with [[Chris Scruggs]] in April 2013]]
Nesmith continues to record and release his own music. His last album, \'\'[[Rays (Michael Nesmith album)|Rays]]\'\', was released in 2006. In 2011, Nesmith returned to producing, working with blues singer/guitarist [[Carolyn Wonderland]].  Nesmith produced Wonderland\'s version of [[Robert Johnson\'s]]\' "I Believe I\'ll Dust My Broom" on her album \'\'Peace Meal\'\'.  Wonderland married writer-comedian [[A. Whitney Brown]] on March 4, 2011, in a ceremony officiated by Nesmith.

In 2012, Nesmith briefly toured Europe prior to re-joining [[The Monkees]] for their tours of the United States.<ref>Lewis, Randy, "Michael Nesmith to launch first U.S. solo tour in 21 years", LA Times, February 23, 2013</ref> Intermixing the Monkees concerts, Nesmith also launched solo tours of the U.S.  Unlike his 1992 U.S. tour, which predominantly featured music from his RCA recordings, Nesmith stated his 2013 tour featured songs that he considers "thematic, chronological and most often requested by fans".  [[Chris Scruggs]], grandson of [[Earl Scruggs]], replaced the late [[Red Rhodes]] on the [[steel guitar]]. The tour was captured on a forthcoming live album, \'\'[[Movies Of The Mind]]\'\'.

In 2014, he guest-starred in Season 4, Episode 9 of the IFC comedy series "Portlandia" in the fictitious role of the father of the Mayor of Portland, Oregon.

==Other appearances==
Nesmith had a [[cameo appearance]] as a taxi driver in the [[Whoopi Goldberg]] film \'\'[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]\'\'.

Nesmith had cameo appearances in his own films including \'\'[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]\'\' (Race Official), \'\'[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]\'\' (Rabbi), and \'\'[[Tapeheads]]\'\' (Water Man).

In a promotional video to support [[Pacific Arts]]\' video release of \'\'[[Tapeheads]]\'\', Nesmith was introduced with a voice-over making fun of his \'\'Monkees\'\' persona. The narration teases Nesmith, who approaches the camera to speak, poking fun at his "missing hat."

An opportunistic lookalike from the U.S. cashed in on his similarity to Nesmith by appearing on talk shows and doing interviews in Australia during the 1980s. The scam was successful, the lookalike being far enough from America to avoid detection as a fraud (which is less likely in the U.S., where the real Nesmith has made many media and show-business acquaintances). An entertaining interviewee, the impersonator\'s charade was not discovered until after he had vanished from the public eye. The imposter, Barry Faulkner, who had pulled various fraudulent scams for 40 years, was finally apprehended and sent to jail in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/world/australia/master-imposter-finally-goes-to-jail-1.58807 |title=Master imposter finally goes to jail |publisher=gulfnews |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=John |first=Katelyn |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/no-discount-for-master-conman/story-fn3dxity-1225698232549 |title=No sentence discount for master conman Barry John Faulkner |publisher=News.com.au |date=March 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 14, 2010}}</ref>

\'\'\'Nashville West\'\'\' was a short-lived [[United States|American]] [[country rock]] quartet that was briefly together in the late 1960s. The group comprised multi-instrumentalist [[Gene Parsons]], guitarist [[Clarence White]], singer-guitarist-fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]] and bassist [[Wayne Moore (musician)|Wayne Moore]]. Parsons and White left the band to join [[The Byrds]] while Guilbeau later joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]].

Along with the [[International Submarine Band]], [[The Byrds]] and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], Nashville West was among the pioneering groups of the [[country rock]] genre.

An album by Nashville West was released in 1976, about eight years after the band had broken up. The material on the \'\'Nashville West\'\' album was recorded during a club date in 1968.

==History==
===Formation===
In the mid-1960s, [[Gene Parsons]] and fiddler [[Gib Guilbeau]], who had been earlier acquainted from their time together in a band called the Castaways, were hired for a recording session with the Gosdin Brothers\' singing duo of [[Vern Gosdin|Vern]] and Rex Gosdin. The session, being produced by [[The Byrds]]\' [[Chris Hillman]], included guitarist [[Clarence White]], who had formerly played [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] guitar in the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]]. Parsons, Guilbeau and White then went on to play on sessions together for several other [[country music]] artists and became the house band for [[Gary S. Paxton]]\'s record label, [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] International Productions.<ref name = "Byrdwatcher">[http://www.ebni.com/byrds/spnw1.html Nashville West], Byrdwatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles, retrieved 2007-10-06</ref>

In the course of their session work, Parsons and White devised the [[B-Bender]], or Stringbender, a system installed on White\'s [[Fender Telecaster]] that made the instrument sound like a [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/>

Eventually, Parsons, Guilbeau and White became a band, joining with fellow session player, bassist-vocalist Wayne Moore, who played in the Castaways with Parsons and Guilbeau.

The group was known by various names, including The Reasons, Gib Guilbeau and The Reasons, the Gary Paxton Band or Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name = "Gib">[http://members.chello.at/thomas.aubrunner/gib3.htm Gib Guilbeau with Nashville West], retrieved 2007-10-06</ref> The Nashville West moniker was taken from the name of the [[El Monte, California]] club where they sat as the house band,<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/> and was the name of an instrumental song composed by Parsons and White.

===Break up===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Parsons and White were then asked to join [[The Byrds]] in 1969. White had already played on 1968\'s \'\'[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]\'\' and \'\'[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]\'\'. After Chris Hillman split from the Byrds with [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] and [[Gram Parsons]] (no relation to Gene) to form [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], White and Gene Parsons joined [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[John York (musician)|John York]] to become full-fledged members of The Byrds. The resulting next album, \'\'[[Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde]]\'\', featured White\'s and Parsons\' signature instrumental tune, "Nashville West". White and Parsons were with the Byrds for the albums \'\'[[Live at the Fillmore - February 1969]]\'\', \'\'[[Ballad of Easy Rider (album)|Ballad of Easy Rider]]\'\', \'\'[[Untitled (The Byrds album)|(Untitled)]]\'\',  \'\'[[Byrdmaniax]]\'\' and \'\'[[Farther Along (The Byrds album)|Farther Along]]\'\'.

When the original line-up of The Byrds reunited in March 1973 to record \'\'[[Byrds]]\'\', White left the Byrds to join the bluegrass [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Muleskinner (band)|Muleskinner]]. He also played on a package tour with several other country rock pioneers at the time, including Gram Parsons. White then reformed his old band, the Kentucky Colonels, with his brothers, but was killed on July 14, 1973 in [[Palmdale, California]], when he was struck by a car driven by a [[Driving under the influence|drunken driver]].

Guilbeau went on to play sessions with [[Linda Ronstadt]] and joined a band called Swampwater. He also played with [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]] in a group called Cold Steel. In 1974, Guilbeau and Gene Parsons joined [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]].

As a session band, Nashville West recorded prolifically, though never under the Nashville West name, backing other artists on [[Gary S. Paxton]]\'s record label.<ref name = "Gib"/> However, in 1978, an album under the name \'\'Nashville West\'\' was eventually released on the [[Sierra Records]] label. The material on it came from a 1968 club date in [[El Monte, California]], which had been recorded by Parsons for personal use, and not necessarily for album release.

The songs include an instrumental reading of [[Bobbie Gentry]]\'s "[[Ode to Billie Joe]]".

"I had a Sony two-track, and I hooked it up, partly to the sound system and partly to the microphones, and just let it run and recorded the whole night," Parsons said. "There\'s a lot that never got on the album, thank goodness."<ref name = "Byrdwatcher"/>

The album was reissued on CD by Sierra in 1997, and added four more tracks not included on the LP edition.

The \'\'\'Outlaws\'\'\'<ref>Outlaws were credited as \'\'The Outlaws\'\' only on their first album, see http://www.discogs.com/artist/Outlaws</ref> are a [[Southern rock]]/[[country rock]] band best known for their 1975 hits "[[There Goes Another Love Song]]" and "[[Green Grass and High Tides]]".

==Early History==
The Outlaws were formed in [[Tampa, Florida]] in late 1967 by guitarist\xe2\x80\x93vocalist [[Hughie Thomasson]], drummer David Dix, bassist Phil Holmberg, guitarists Hobie O\'Brien and Frank Guidry, plus singer Herb Pino. Guidry brought the name Outlaws with him when he joined (he had been in another group that had that name). Previous to Guidry\'s arrival the band was called The Rogues, then The Four Letter Words. By early 1968 O\'Brien and Holmberg both left the band to get married, and Frank O\'Keefe came in on bass. Later that year, Tommy Angarano joined the Outlaws to replace Herb Pino, bringing Hammond organ sounds and his style of vocals to the band. Shortly after, he quit and Herb was brought back in. In the spring of 1968 the group\'s first manager, Paul D., brought them to Epic Studios in [[New York City]] to record an album, which was never released after the band and the producer of the album had a falling-out. Guidry left at this point after differences with the manager. The group headed back to Tampa, then got another deal to go to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]]. There they recorded another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released, and Gernhard vanished soon after. Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time to play bass while O\'Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O\'Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herb Pino began playing guitars and doing vocals at this time. Drummer [[Monte Yoho]] also joined that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, the Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul D. (Ped-Dyn. Productions.) The Dave Graham Group\'s Union leader was Monte Yoho, but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O\'Keefe, Dave Dix, [[Billy Jones (musician)|Billy Jones]] and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They recorded a cover of [[The Doors]]\' "[[Five to One]]" as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This grouping disbanded in the spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Paul D. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so, not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 [[Henry Paul (musician)|Henry Paul]], a singer and guitarist who was born in [[New York]] but grew up in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in [[Greenwich Village]] NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O\'Keefe. In 1972 Hughie Thomasson returned from a brief spell in New York where he\'d been backing up folksinger [[Milton Carroll]], joined up with Paul, Yoho and O\'Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws.
 
Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971 and 1972, returned from a stint in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band\'s first infamous guitar trio later dubbed "The Florida Guitar Army". O\'Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973\xe2\x80\x9374. Buzzy Meekins and another bassist named Rick Birkbeck stood in until he was able to return. In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for The Outlaws. [[Alan Walden]] (brother of [[Capricorn Records]] founder [[Phil Walden]]) was told of the group by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] frontman [[Ronnie Van Zant]] and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to [[Arista Records]] under [[Clive Davis]]. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]. On the way to the stage for Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s set, lead vocalist [[Ronnie Van Zant]] said to Clive Davis who was with Charlie Brusco \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t sign the Outlaws, you\xe2\x80\x99re the dumbest music person I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met\xe2\x80\x94and I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xe2\x80\x9d <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2569036.ece|title=Hughie Thomasson obituary|work=Times Online|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|date=2 October 2007|accessdate=2007-10-13}}</ref>

The Outlaws\' earliest well known songs were "[[There Goes Another Love Song]]" and "[[Green Grass and High Tides]]", both from their 1975 eponymous [[Outlaws (The Outlaws album)|debut album]].  Their 1980 cover of "[[Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|(Ghost) Riders in the Sky]]" from the album \'\'[[Ghost Riders (album)|Ghost Riders]]\'\' was their biggest single chart success, reaching No.&nbsp;31 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' "Pop Singles" chart.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5084/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Outlaws Chart & Awards Billboard Singles|work=All Music site|publisher=Macrovision Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:The Outlaws - Thomasson & Jones.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Thomasson & Jones]]

While the Outlaws are generally considered to be a part of the southern rock genre, there are distinct differences in their approach and their influences. Their primary similarity to other southern rock bands is the dual lead guitar interplay, a defining characteristic of many southern rock bands. However, the Outlaws\xe2\x80\x99 mix of country and rock elements displays the vocal harmony influences of groups like [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[the Byrds]], and [[Poco]]. Their use of three and four part harmonies set them apart from their contemporaries who usually relied on a single lead vocalist.

[[Hughie Thomasson]]\'s signature guitar playing style and voice were defining characteristics of the band\'s sound. Thomasson\'s guitar sound was underpinned by the use of the [[Fender Stratocaster]] (and sometimes a [[Fender Telecaster]]) played in a quasi-[[country music|country]] style mixed with fluid, quick [[blues]] runs. Hughie was nicknamed "The Flame" for his flaming fast guitar work. He is a member of the Fender Hall of Fame.

The other lead guitarist, Billy Jones, played mainly a [[Gibson Les Paul]] and switched between a clean and distorted sound. A good example of this can be heard on "Green Grass and High Tides" on the right stereo channel. Hughie Thomasson\'s smooth Stratocaster sound can be heard on the left channel. Thomasson opens the first solo at the intro and plays the first half of the two succeeding longer solos all on the right channel. There are many video examples of his Green Grass solos on the internet.

The [[gramophone record|records]] released by the band between 1975 and 1980 are considered the best representation of the band\'s style. The band was seen on successful concert tours billed with other non-southern rock acts of the time including opening for the Who on the \'Who Boots In\' tour in 1976. This contrast of styles was more common at that time than the packaged "genre" tours seen so often these days. The willingness of promoters to mix styles led to the Outlaws gaining a large following in the [[United States]].

The Outlaws style is highly characterized in their first three albums. These are considered the best work of the band with all of the "classic era" band members, except for O\'Keefe who was replaced by the left-handed bass player [[Harvey Dalton Arnold]] (see below for a complete roster of Outlaws members). O\'Keefe and Jones both died in February 1995; Jones by suicide.

The albums released after 1980 are largely viewed by critics as a gradual move away from the original sound that gained them success in the 1970s. The reworking of the Western-styled "Ghost Riders" in 1980 was the band\'s last taste of big league success, although the band released two more records, \'\'Los Hombres Malo\'\' in 1982 and \'\'Soldiers of Fortune\'\' in 1986. As the 1980s came to a close, Thomasson became the final original member of the act. Albums such as \'\'[[Diablo Canyon (album)|Diablo Canyon]]\'\', released in 1994, were released on smaller independent record labels. The band by now was mostly confined to smaller club dates. This situation led to Thomasson accepting the [http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/lynyrd-skynyrd guitar position] in the legendary, and by now much more popular, [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] in 1996. This essentially sidelined the Outlaws for a decade, as Thomasson\'s voice and guitar style were just too integral a part of the Outlaws\' sound for the other members to successfully work without it. In 2000, the \'\'Diablo Canyon\'\'-lineup released the album \'\'So Low\'\', to mixed response from fans. Many cited it as being more of a solo output from Thomasson. After this release, the band again vanished from the musical environment.

[[Henry Paul (musician)|Henry Paul]] went on to form the country band [[BlackHawk (band)|BlackHawk]], which had some chart success in the 1990s.

In April 2005, classic members Hughie Thomasson, Henry Paul, Monte Yoho, and David Dix reunited as the Outlaws and the rest of the lineup was filled out with former guitarist Chris Anderson, bassist Randy Threet, and Dave Robbins on keyboards. The latter three had been with Paul\'s country group [[BlackHawk (band)|BlackHawk]]. The two classic members not included in the lineup, guitarist Billy Jones and bassist Frank O\'Keefe, could not join as they both died in 1995, within weeks of each other. O\'Keefe died of a drug overdose and Jones committed suicide shortly after. Paul and Robbins left to resume their careers in BlackHawk in early 2006, but the remaining band soldiered on. They were part of the [[Charlie Daniels]] Volunteer Jam tour in the summer of 2007. Band leader Hughie Thomasson died on September 9, 2007, of a heart attack in [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]], [[Florida]]. [http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/11/Hillsborough/Southern_rock_icon_di.shtml obituary report] No release date has been announced for the new [[recording studio|studio]] album, \'\'[[Once An Outlaw|Once an Outlaw]]\'\', that was finished before Thomasson\'s death.

A cover version of their trademark epic 10-minute track "Green Grass and High Tides" is featured as the finale in the set list for guitar and bass in the video game \'\'[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]\'\' and features two complicated solos.

In December 2007, 2008 Outlaws tour dates were released. In January 2008, the Outlaws lineup would be revealed to include Henry Paul (guitars/vocals), Monte Yoho (drums), Chris Anderson (guitars/vocals), and Randy Threet (bass), along with newer additions Billy Crain (guitars), Jon Coleman (keyboards), and Brett Cartwright (bass). Cartwright left the band shortly thereafter. This would be the first lineup in Outlaws\' history without Hughie Thomasson on guitar and vocals, as from the band\'s formation to his death, he was the only constant member, garnering him the nicknames "Mr. Outlaw" and "The Lone Outlaw".

According to the band\'s web site, the Outlaws announced their intention to continue to tour throughout the summer and fall of 2009 with this lineup and planned to participate in the [[Simple Man Cruise]] with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] in January 2010. It was also stated on the website that the band would change its name to \'Henry Paul Band\' due to Thomasson\'s death, but to continue touring with the same setlists.

In May 2010, The Outlaws were featured, along with [[The Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Molly Hatchet]], Blackberry Smoke, and The Chris Hicks Band, on stage at Long Island Southern Jam 2010 in Babylon, NY at Overlook Beach. The all-day concert featured a unique jam fest for all the bands. *[http://www.LongIslandSouthernJam.com/ LI Southern Jam website]

For the 2010 tour Dave Robbins returned on keyboards and Henry Paul was involved in a lawsuit brought about by Hughie Thomasson\'s widow, Mary, which alleged trademark violations.  In April, 2011 the case was ruled upon in favor of Henry Paul, Monte Yoho and the co-defendants.

On July 30, 2012, it was announced on the band\'s website that "their first new album in 18 years" will be released on September 25, 2012, titled "It\'s About Pride". It will also be accompanied by a separately released DVD documentary about the making of the new album, called "Hidin\' Out In Tennessee".

\'\'\'The Ozark Mountain Daredevils\'\'\' are an American [[Southern rock]]/[[country rock]] band formed in 1972 in [[Springfield, Missouri]], United States.  They are most widely known for their singles "If You Wanna Get To Heaven" in 1974 and "[[Jackie Blue (song)|Jackie Blue]]" in 1975.

The Daredevils are also mentioned in the "Don\'s Story" chapter of American [[humorist]] [[David Sedaris]]\' book \'\'[[Barrel Fever]].\'\' Bassist Michael "Supe" Granda has also written a book about the band, \'\'It Shined.\'\'

==Name==
It is mentioned in the book about the band "It Shined", by Michael Granda, that the band name was derived from "Cosmic Corn Cob & His Amazing Ozark Mountain Daredevils", a name that John Dillon came up with at a [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] "naming party" after the band was told that the name they had previously been using, "Family Tree", was already taken. The band shortened the name because none of the band members at the time wanted to be called "Cosmic Corn Cob", and they did not want the name to sound similar to The [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]].

==Formation and the Family Tree==
In 1971 Randle Chowning formed the band which included Steve Cash, [[Randle Chowning]], John Dillon, Elizabeth Anderson, Larry Lee and Michael Granda began playing together with Bill Jones (flute, horns, formerly of Mike Bunge\'s band Granny\'s Bathwater) and Rick Campanelli (piano) at Springfield, Missouri\'s New Bijou Theater for small crowds of friends on Wednesday night under the name "Family Tree" ("Emergency Band", "Burlap Socks" and "Buffalo Chips" were other names they considered for this grouping in the early days). Larry Lee was working at the New Bijou as a bartender. The band recorded a demo at Springfield\'s Top Talent studios and that demo, containing such early songs as "Rhythm of Joy", found its way to New York music executive [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] via the hands of band friend Steve Canaday, who was co-owner of the New Bijou Theater. Hammond sent a producer, Michael Sunday, to the band\'s Ruedi-Valley Ranch in [[Aldrich, Missouri]], the house rented from Randle Chowning\'s Southwest Missouri State teacher Mrs. Ruedi, where the band rehearsed and where Chowning and his brother Rusty lived. Sunday offered the group $500 to make another demo tape but ultimately decided to pass on offering them a contract.<ref name="ReferenceA">Granda. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

The band later sent a tape to the team who managed fellow Missourians [[Brewer & Shipley]], Kansas City\'s Paul Peterson and Stan Plesser (who also owned the Vanguard, a popular coffee house and ran their own Good Karma Productions), who gave the band a chance and became their managers as well. The band then changed their name to the Ozark Mountain Daredevils in 1972 (see "Name") and saw the departure of Campanelli and Jones and the addition of Buddy Brayfield, a friend of Granda\'s, as the piano player. Anderson, though still romantically involved with Dillon, retired from the stage. Campanelli left on his own to pursue a masters degree in music; Jones rejoined the Daredevils briefly later and would continue to appear as a guest player on some of their shows and recording sessions.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==1970s (The A&M years)==
The band began playing out in 1972 and 1973. On February 8, 1973 they played at Cowtown Ballroom in Kansas City, Missouri. Later that month, on February 21, 1973, they played a concert at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School in Shawnee, Kansas. Two weeks after that, on both March 9 & 10, 1973, they played at Cowtown Ballroom again, this time with Brewer & Shipley accompanied by [[Loudon Wainwright III]]. Performances from the Cowtown shows later turned up on a CD called \'\'[[Archive Alive]]\'\' in 1997.

The group\'s demo tape eventually caught the attention of [[A&M Records]] staff producer [[David Anderle]], who was looking for an [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] [[country rock]] type of band to place on the label. Anderle and the Eagles\' first producer, [[Glyn Johns]], flew to Missouri to catch the band\'s aforementioned performance at Cowtown Ballroom on March 10, 1973. But the band, nervous about Johns and Anderle being in the audience, did not play their best. Later on, Paul Peterson invited the two men back to his place to hear the band give an unplugged performance by candlelight. This time Anderle and Johns were blown away and they were signed to A&M on May 1, 1973 and sent to England to record their first record with Johns at the helm during that June and July.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The first record, \'\'[[The Ozark Mountain Daredevils (album)|The Ozark Mountain Daredevils]]\'\' (also referred to as "The Quilt Album"), was released in December 1973 and spawned the Top 30 hit "If You Wanna Get to Heaven" in the summer of 1974. The album introduced the band\'s unique mixture of rock, country, bluegrass and pop to the world and is still the favorite of many of the group\'s fans.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

For the second album, \'\'[[It\'ll Shine When It Shines]]\'\' (October 1974), Johns and Anderle came to Missouri to record, utilizing a mobile recording truck set up outside of the band\'s rehearsal home. During the sessions, Johns overheard Larry Lee sitting at a piano playing and singing a song about a mysterious friend of his who sometimes dealt drugs on the side. Johns loved the melody and thought it could be a smash hit if the lyrics were altered to be about a girl and the drug references downplayed. Lee and Cash did as Johns asked and the song, "Jackie Blue", became the Daredevils\' signature song and a huge hit (No.&nbsp;3) in early 1975.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The Ozark\'s third release, \'\'[[The Car Over the Lake Album]]\'\' (September 1975), recorded in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and produced by Anderle alone, featured their old compatriot, Bill Jones, joining them to play and arrange their songs. He also toured with them in 1975-1976. Another face from the past, Steve Canaday, also came back into the group\'s life at this same time as road manager and opening act before joining the band in 1976. The album sold fairly well but produced no hits. One reason why the band\'s fortunes began to falter might have been their reluctance to relocate to [[Southern California]] after being asked to do so by A&M co-head [[Jerry Moss]]. Another reason was their reluctance to do the constant touring that many of their fellow contemporaries were doing back then. And an even further sticking point was the band\'s unwillingness to follow formulas and attempt to create clones of their biggest hit, "Jackie Blue", or copy what other groups were doing. As a result, A&M began to lose a bit of their enthusiasm for the act at this point.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Personnel shifts within the group also began to change the chemistry. Because of their unwillingness to tour and do new material, Randle Chowning left the band only to return later to a much scaled down version of the original band. In April/May 1976, the band embarked on a tour of Europe. But by the time the exhausted troupe hit [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] for the tour\'s final stop at Daddy\'s Dance Hall, they were confounded by a horrible sound mix for their show. Norwegian musician Rune Walle, whom the band had met while on tour in Europe with his band The Flying Norwegians came into the group. Walle\'s first show with the group was at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in Kansas City on July 23, 1976 on a bill that also included [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Firefall]]. Chowning went on to form his own Randle Chowning Band<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

That same year, the Daredevils headed west to the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], to [[Caribou Ranch]] near [[Nederland, Colorado]], to record their fourth album, which they had originally titled \'\'Nuclear Fishin\'\' \' but then changed to \'\'[[Men From Earth]]\'\' after A&M objected. The \'\'Nuclear Fishin\'\'\' title was later used up in Canada for a greatest hits pack. Anderle was once again in the producer\'s chair and [[Evergreen, Colorado]] resident Jerry Mills joined the band on mandolin and also served as the group\'s advance publicist.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In the fall of 1976, Buddy Brayfield departed to study medicine and Ruell Chappell (vocals, keyboards), from the popular Springfield group Spillwater Junction, came in. But the band\'s next several releases -- \'\'[[Men From Earth]]\'\' (September 1976), \'\'[[Don\'t Look Down (Ozark Mountain Daredevils album)|Don\'t Look Down]]\'\' (October 1977, produced by [[David Kershenbaum]], once again at Caribou Ranch) and \'\'[[It\'s Alive (Ozark Mountain Daredevils album)|It\'s Alive]]\'\' (September 1978) -- sold in lesser quantities than their previous records had. Jerry Mills and his mandolin were dropped from the group after \'\'It\'s Alive\'\' since the band was performing fewer acoustic numbers in their show by this time.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

During the summer of 1978, the Daredevils went out for a short run of shows where they opened for [[Fleetwood Mac]].Springfield bassist Larry Van Fleet (from the Randle Chowning Band)sat in for some of these dates. On August 26, 1978, the Ozarks appeared at [[Canada Jam]] on a large bill that also included [[Kansas]], [[Atlanta Rhythm Section]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[The Commodores]] and others.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Also in 1978, John Dillon and Steve Cash contributed to an album, \'\'[[White Mansions]]\'\', which documented life in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]]. [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jessi Colter]], [[Bernie Leadon]] and several other musicians appeared on this record as well.

1978 also had Larry Lee recording a solo album for A&M that was not released.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In September 1978 the group flew to [[Hollywood]] to appear on [[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]. But when A&M\'s Jerry Moss witnessed the inebriated band members race through their set on the show, he decided not to pick up the option on their record deal and the Ozarks found themselves without a home in 1979.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==1980s==
By 1979 the group had moved over to [[Columbia Records]] and put out the self-titled \'\'Ozark Mountain Daredevils\'\' in May 1980. This album was produced by famed country rock pioneer producer [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] and did not feature Chappell or Canaday, and Walle only appeared on two songs, since Boylan insisted on bringing in session players for a more typical "California country rock laid back sound", which was popular at the time. But country rock\'s popularity seemed to be on the wane at the dawn of the 1980s as groups such as the Ozarks, [[Poco]] and [[Firefall]] saw their sales begin to slip away. Columbia dropped the group after only one record.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1980 Walle left the Daredevils to be replaced by Springfield guitarist Terry Wilson.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In December 1980 Brayfield, Chowning, Jones and Walle reunited with the band for two shows, one in Springfield and one in Kansas City. The first was at [[Hammons Student Center]] on December 6 and the second, on December 31, occurred at the [[Uptown Theater (Kansas City, Missouri)|Uptown Theater]] in K.C. The latter show was later put out on CD (in August 2006) and DVD (in June 2007) as \'\'1980 Reunion Concert: [[Rhythm And Joy]]\'\'.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Larry Lee left the band and relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a solo career in 1982. He also worked as a songwriter and country producer (for [[Alabama]], [[Juice Newton]] and others) and would still play drums on occasion with other acts. In the mid-\'80s, he even did a stint with [[Jimmy Buffett]]\'s [[Coral Reefer Band]]. Chappell also split in 1982, leaving the group a quintet.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Later the same year, there was another major upheaval as Dillon and Cash decided that they\'d had enough as well. After some consideration, it was decided that the group would continue with Granda and the returning Randle Chowning leading a new lineup that included Bobby Lloyd Hicks (vocals, drums, percussion, ex-[[Steve Forbert]]), Joe Terry (vocals, keyboards, from the St. Louis group The Couch Dancers) and [[Tulsa]] guitarist Gary Smith. Canaday stayed on and once again became the band\'s road manager.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

This new grouping only lasted about a year and a half before Chowning left because of the lack of unwillingness to tour and write new material,  Hicks took a job with Kerry Cole & the Lefty Brothers and Joe Terry joined a new band, [[The Morells]]. At this point, Dillon and Cash agreed to rejoin and Gary Smith stayed around a few months more before relocating to [[Branson, Missouri]], so the mid-1984 Ozarks lineup was: John Dillon, Steve Cash, \'Supe\' Granda, Steve Canaday and Jason LeMasters (guitar), the latter soon departing to work for [[Kris Kristofferson]] and replaced by Chowning, back for his third stint with the Daredevils.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1985 the band followed their erstwhile singer/drummer, Larry Lee, to Nashville to record a new album produced by Wendy Waldman that, like their 1980 Columbia release, utilized session players. Lee briefly rejoined for this album but there was no interest at all from any of the labels in Nashville in the project. A small French company, Dixie Frog Records, eventually picked up the record and it was released in France as \'\'Heart of the Country\'\' in 1987. Many of the same songs were released in England in 1989 as \'\'Modern History\'\' on the Conifer label.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In the meantime, the Daredevils continued on with Morells guitarist Don Clinton Thompson in 1985. A group of mostly unreleased tracks (the demos that they used to send around to the record companies) from 1972 was released on [[Var\xc3\xa8se Sarabande Records]] this same year as \'\'The Lost Cabin Sessions\'\'.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

There were more personnel changes as Canaday left to move to Nashville in 1988 (Sadly, he was killed on September 25, 1999 when the small plane he was traveling in crashed in Nashville, Tennessee while he was working as an aerial photographer), Chowning was the last band member to see him a few days before his death, and was briefly succeeded on drums by the band\'s roadie, Rick \'Lumpy\' Davidson, who previously had sometimes joined the group onstage playing washboard.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

At the end of 1989, Thompson quit to reform his old band, The Skeletons, and Davidson moved to Branson to take a job as sound mixer at [[Ray Stevens]]\' theater. In 1990 guitarist Bill Brown (from Supe\'s side band Supe & the Sandwiches) and Morells drummer Ron Gremp came aboard. The band continued their now-limited touring.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==1990s==
A 1990 release, \'\'Now Hear This!\'\', was put out on cassette tape only.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Granda, like Lee and Canaday before him, and Chowning who moved to Nashville in 1999, decided to uproot himself and settle in Nashville where he peddled his songs, searched for a deal for his side band, Supe & the Sandwiches, and became involved in other projects, including a stint as bass player in [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]]\'s [[Byrds]]. In the summer of 1992, the Daredevils resumed their ever-dwindling schedule of gigs.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 1996 the Ozarks were approached by their former manager, Stan Plesser, to re-record some of their best-known songs for a company called Eclipse Records. This was recorded in Nashville with producer Bob Wright with only Dillon, Cash and Granda (Larry Lee and Steve Canaday guested on backup vocals) playing on this project accompanied by session players. The CD was titled \'\'Jackie Blue\'\' and appeared in March 1997 as a budget product sold mostly at [[truck stop]]s.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

New Era Productions, a company formed by an old Springfield buddy of the group\'s, Benny Smith, agreed to fund another album of brand new material, \'\'13\'\'. This was produced, mostly in Nashville, by Larry Lee, who played and sang on it as well. Chowning also contributed to the album. \'\'13\'\' was released in June 1997. Also that year came \'\'[[Archive Alive]]\'\', a CD containing performances  from their 1973 shows at Cowtown Ballroom in Kansas City and [[Kiel Opera House]] in St Louis.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==2000s==
On July 23, 2004, guitarist Bill Brown died of smoke inhalation in a house fire in Springfield that also took the life of another popular Springfield guitarist Don Shipps. On October 16 of this same year, the group and several other Springfield bands appeared at the Shrine Mosque in a memorial show for Brown and benefit for his family.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Since that time the band has gone into semi-retirement but usually emerges each year to play shows, sometimes joined by members Larry Lee and Randle Chowning. The 2004 lineup contained Dillon, Cash, \'Supe,\' Ron Gremp and Dave Painter (who joined for the 2004 Shrine Mosque show). Beginning with a series of shows in May 2007 at Gillioz Theater in Springfield, Kelly Brown joined as the group\'s new keyboardist. These shows were recorded for a 2008 DVD release called \'\'[[Revival (Live at the Gillioz)]] \'\'. 

Starting in 2005, Lee and Chowning have reteamed in a new group, Beyond Reach, that formed in Nashville but has since moved its base back to the two men\'s hometown of Springfield, Missouri.

==2010s==

A brand new live album by the Daredevils, a two-disc set featuring 21 tracks, including old favorites, rare songs and a couple of new ones, titled \'\'Alive & Wild\'\', was made available in October 2011.  This was taken from shows performed at Wildwood Springs Lodge in Steelville, Missouri in November 2010. Larry Lee and Randle Chowning also played at the Steeville, Missouri shows for two years, making those shows a special blend with their contributions to the songs that the fans enjoy. The band line up for some of these shows included: John Dillon, Steve Cash, Michael \xe2\x80\x98Supe\xe2\x80\x99 Granda, Ron Gremp, Dave Painter, Kelly Brown, Bill Jones, Ruell Chappell and Nick Sibley (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals). Since 2010, the band has continued to make concert appearances with this nine piece line-up, excluding Larry Lee and Randle Chowning much to the chagrin of the fans.

Former early band member Buddy Brayfield, now Dr. Sam Brayfield is a family practice, hospice and palliative care physician in [[Osage Beach]], [[Missouri]] and plays with a local band \'Buddy and the Notes\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ingramsonline.com/Apr_2012/50Missourians/Missouriansnew6.php |title=50 Missourians You Should Know &#124; Class of 2012 |publisher=Ingramsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref> For the first time since 1980, Brayfield rejoined the group for a reunion concert in September 2010 that included four of the original six members. Brayfield indicated that he decided to play in the Missouri concert since his children had never seen him play with the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tagsgf.com/2010/09/07/daredevils-update-buddy-brayfield-added-to-this-weekends-concert-lineup/ |title=Daredevils Update: Buddy Brayfield added to this weekend\'s concert lineup &#124; TAG Magazine (tagsgf) &#124; Entertainment in Springfield, MO |publisher=| |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://ccheadliner.com/test/article_11140fa3-20b7-55fa-88c0-e430ea2ce036.html |title=Ozark Mountain Daredevils return to Gillioz - CCHeadliner.com: Test |publisher=CCHeadliner.com |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref> The show was at the Gillioz Theater in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[Missouri]].

In March of 2015, Randle Chowning and Larry Lee were honored by the Missouri Writers Hall of Fame and given the coveted Quill Award. This was the first time that the award was given to songwriters.

\'\'\'Poco\'\'\' is a [[United States|Southern California]] [[country rock]] band originally formed by [[Richie Furay]],  [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] and [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]].

The title of their first album, \'\'[[Pickin\' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin\' Up the Pieces]]\'\', is a reference to the break-up of Buffalo Springfield.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Throughout the years Poco has performed in various groupings, and was still active as of late 2013.

==History==

===Inception===
During recording of [[Buffalo Springfield]]\'s third and final album, \'\'[[Last Time Around]]\'\', lead singers [[Stephen Stills]], [[Neil Young]] and [[Richie Furay]] each recorded songs without the other members present.  One of Furay\'s solo efforts was the country-influenced ballad "Kind Woman", which he recorded with the help of producer/engineer/bassist [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] and [[pedal steel guitar]]ist [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]].<ref name="Eder">Eder, Bruce.  [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=poco|bio=true}} \'Poco\']; \'\'[[Allmusic]]\'\'.</ref>

When Buffalo Springfield split up, Furay, Messina and Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs.  Its original lineup was Furay (vocals and [[rhythm guitar]]), Messina ([[lead guitar]], vocals, producer), Rusty Young ([[pedal steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, mandolin and vocals), [[George Grantham (musician)|George Grantham]] ([[drum kit|drums]] and vocals) and [[Randy Meisner]] ([[bass guitar|bass]] and vocals).  The group was signed to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]], which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfield\'s [[Atlantic Records]] label in return for those to [[Graham Nash]] of [[The Hollies]] (who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]).<ref name="Eder" />  Originally, the new group was named "Pogo", after the [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo comic strip]] character, but was changed when its creator, [[Walt Kelly]], objected and threatened to sue.

===Furay era (1969 to 1973)===
Their first album, \'\'[[Pickin\' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin\' Up the Pieces]]\'\' (1969), is considered a seminal album of the country rock genre.<ref>Eder, Bruce.  [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=poco|chart=all}} \'\'Pickin\' Up the Pieces\'\' review], \'\'[[Allmusic]]\'\'.</ref> Reviewer Charley Walters awarded the release with 5 stars in the 1979 Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by Dave Marsh and John Swenson, although it was subsequently reduced to 4 stars in the 1983 revised and updated edition of the book. However, the album performed weakly, peaking at No.&nbsp;63 on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Billboard 200|album chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band\'s lineup proved to be a problem throughout its career. During the recording of the debut album, Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay (reportedly, Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first album\'s final mix playback sessions).<ref>Eliot, Marc. \'\'To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles\'\'. Da Capo Press, 2004. p.37. ISBN 978-0-306-81398-6</ref> After a stint playing with [[Ricky Nelson]]\'s Stone Canyon Band, Meisner later became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Messina took over on bass until [[Timothy B. Schmit]] joined Poco in September 1969.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Their second studio album \'\'[[Poco (album)|Poco]]\'\' (1970) again resulted in low sales, peaking at No.&nbsp;58. The band\'s next album, \'\'[[Deliverin\']]\'\' (or \'\'DeLIVErin\'\'\' as it sometimes represented), picked up moderate airplay, Furay\'s "C\'mon" hitting No.&nbsp;69. \'\'Deliverin\xe2\x80\x99\'\' became Poco\'s first album to reach the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], peaking at No.&nbsp;26. Messina chose to leave the band in October 1970, feeling Furay exhibited too much control over the group\'s sound and left the band to return to studio production. At the recommendation of [[Peter Cetera]] of [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], Messina selected guitarist/singer [[Paul Cotton (musician)|Paul Cotton]], a one-time member of the [[Illinois Speed Press]] to replace him.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The realigned Poco, now on its third lineup on just its fourth album, hired [[Steve Cropper]] as [[record producer|producer]] and released \'\'[[From the Inside (Poco album)]]\'\' (1971). Again, poor sales were the result as the release landed at No.&nbsp;52.  The band and its management were dissatisfied with Cropper\'s production and hired [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], who oversaw the next three albums, beginning with \'\'[[A Good Feelin\' to Know]]\'\' (1972). The band built the LP around the title track, a popular concert tune, but the single failed to chart. The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;69. As a result, Furay became increasingly discouraged with Poco\'s prospects, especially since ex-bandmates Stills, Young, Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups. In an April 26, 1973 \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine interview with Cameron Crowe he vented that Poco was still a second-billed act and had not increased its audience. The next album, \'\'[[Crazy Eyes]]\'\' (1973), reached No.&nbsp;38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with [[J. D. Souther]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to create the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]] on Asylum.  Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartet.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Post-Furay era (1973 to 1977)===
After Furay\'s departure, the band released their last two albums with Epic; \'\'[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]\'\' (1974) and \'\'[[Cantamos]]\'\' (1974). The albums charted at No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;76 respectively. Poco left Epic after \'\'Cantamos\'\' and signed with [[ABC-Dunhill Records]].  \'\'[[Head Over Heels (Poco album)|Head Over Heels]]\'\' was their first ABC release, featuring Schmit\'s acoustic "Keep On Tryin\'", which became the group\'s most successful single to date, charting at No.&nbsp;50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. Around the time of the release of \'\'Head Over Heels\'\', \'\'[[The Very Best of Poco (1975 album)|The Very Best of Poco]]\'\' was released as a [[compilation album]] that documented the group\'s years with Epic.  Epic\'s release fought with \'\'Head Over Heals\'\' for attention though neither charted very well, hitting No.&nbsp;43 and No.&nbsp;90, respectively.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The group\'s next ABC-Dunhill album was \'\'[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose Of Cimarron]]\'\' which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at No.&nbsp;89. Another Epic release also came out in 1976, the live album \'\'[[Live (Poco album)|Live]]\'\'. \'\'[[Indian Summer (Poco album)|Indian Summer]]\'\' was released the following spring, peaking at No.&nbsp;57, while the title track reached No.&nbsp;50.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Success (1977 to 1980)===
In August 1977, with the support of the rest of Poco, Schmit quit to join [[The Eagles]], coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again.  As a result, a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC.  After languishing in storage for many years, the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as \'\'[[The Last Roundup (Poco)|The Last Roundup]]\'\' in 2004.

After Schmit\'s departure, Poco decided to take a break. Grantham took some time off, while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the "Cotton-Young Band" and redoubled their efforts to succeed.  They selected the Britons Steve Chapman ([[Drum kit|drums]]) and Charlie Harrison ([[bass guitar|bass]]) (former [[Judas Jump]]), both of whom had played together with [[Leo Sayer]] and [[Al Stewart]], to round out their new quartet.  However, ABC decided to pick up the Cotton-Young album  \xe2\x80\x94 as long as they continued under the \'Poco\' name. Thus, although Grantham had never quit Poco, he found himself bought out of the group.  He subsequently landed a job as drummer for [[Ricky Skaggs]].

\'\'[[Legend (Poco)|Legend]]\'\' (1978), the Cotton-Young album with cover art by graphic artist (and later comedy actor) [[Phil Hartman]], subsequently became the group\'s most commercially successful album, containing two Top Twenty hits, "[[Crazy Love (Poco song)|Crazy Love]]" written and sung by Rusty Young (which also had a seven-week run at Number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary chart]] in early 1979, the biggest hit on the AC chart that year) and Cotton\'s "[[Heart of the Night (song)|Heart of the Night]]".  The album was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]], Poco\'s first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution.  Kim Bullard ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) joined the band in December 1978 just as \'\'Legend\'\' was being released.  While "Crazy Love" was riding up the charts, ABC Records was sold to [[MCA Records]].  Poco was retained by MCA and the \'\'Legend\'\' album was reissued on the MCA label. With the momentum built up from \'\'Legend\'\'\'s success, Poco played their new hit "Heart of the Night" on the live album \'\'[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]\'\' in support of nuclear-free energy, which featured several other big artists such as [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Jackson Browne]].

===1980 to 1999===
[[Image:JimMessina(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|238px|right|[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], founding member of Poco, performing in 2009]]
During the first half of the 1980s, the group released five more albums: \'\'[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]\'\' (1980), \'\'[[Blue And Gray]]\'\' (1981), \'\'[[Cowboys & Englishmen]]\'\' (1982) on MCA and, moving over to [[Atlantic Records]], \'\'[[Ghost Town (Poco)|Ghost Town]]\'\' (1982) and \'\'[[Inamorata (Poco)|Inamorata]]\'\' (1984). Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by \'\'Legend\'\', with each album performing more poorly than its predecessor.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Furay, Schmit and Grantham had, since their departures, each guested with Poco at various times. \'\'Inamorata\'\' in 1984 included contributions by all three former members. Poco contributed the song "I\'ll Leave it Up to You" to the \'\'[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]\'\' soundtrack.

The group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of \'\'Inamorata\'\' but continued to tour, mostly in small clubs. Bullard left to rejoin [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] in 1983 and Harrison (who had not played on \'\'Inamorata\'\') departed in mid-1984. New members [[Jeff Steele]] (bass) and Rick Seratte (keyboards, backing vocals) came in for Poco\'s 1984 tour dates, but they departed, along with drummer Chapman, to be replaced in 1985 by Jack Sundrud (vocals, bass, guitar) and the returning Grantham.  Grantham\'s reunion was brief though; In 1986 Ricky Skaggs asked him to rejoin his band.  Chapman came back to take over drums again. After a few scattered dates for Poco in 1987, Paul Cotton did not perform with Poco again until 1992.

After a lengthy recording hiatus, at the urging of [[Richard Marx]], Poco re-emerged on the [[RCA]] label with the successful \'\'[[Legacy (Poco)|Legacy]]\'\' (1989), reuniting original members Young, Furay, Messina, Grantham, and Meisner 20 years after Poco\'s debut.  The album produced a Top 20 hit, "Call It Love" and another Top 40 hit, "Nothing to Hide," earning Poco its second gold album (in its 19th album).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  The group (having added a keyboardist, Dave Vanacore) toured in early 1990 opening for Marx. Furay bowed out early on and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay. In 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young, Messina and Meisner (drummer [[Gary Mallaber]] joined them for dates in Japan that July). But by the end of 1991, Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers.

By early 1992, Poco was once again without a record deal, Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name and, though they had not officially disbanded, the band seemed to be quietly fading away. But despite this, Young once again teamed with Cotton, brought in new members Richard Neville (vocals, bass) and Tim Smith (drums), and toured through the end of the decade, although at a very limited schedule. Young and Cotton occasionally also appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo.

===2000 through 2013===
Poco again became more active as a touring unit after Grantham and Sundrud rejoined in 2000, reuniting the group\'s 1985 lineup. \'\'[[Running Horse]]\'\' (2002) found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years. The CD was released through the band\'s website. Furay, who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted home-state of Colorado, reunited with the band again for a sold out show in Nashville in May 2004, resulting in the CD\xe2\x80\x93DVD release \'\'[[Keeping the Legend Alive]]\'\' (2004).  In July of the same year, Grantham suffered a [[stroke]] during a live performance. Muscle Shoals Sound studio drummer [[George Lawrence (drummer)|George Lawrence]] subbed on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004 and became a permanent member in 2005. Grantham\'s recovery was slow and expensive, and the group created a donor fund on its official website, Poconut.org, to offset some of his considerable medical expenses.

Poco continued to write and record while performing at festivals, performing arts centers, theaters and clubs.  In 2005, they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo Foster and LLoyd, substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US. Cotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the lineup of Young, Cotton, Sundrud, and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums. Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this lineup. Beginning in 2009 Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only.  Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in [[Steelville, Missouri]], a tour of California in 2009 ending at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in Indio where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit, and several dates opening for [[Loggins and Messina]] featuring Furay, Messina, and Grantham.   \'\'[[Bareback at Big Sky]]\'\' (2005) and  \'\'[[The Wildwood Sessions]]\'\' (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career.   \'\'[[Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71]]\'\' (2010) unearthed a legendary unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham, and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends. In early 2010, Paul Cotton abruptly left the band to perform solo and with his band.

Americana veteran multi-instrumentalist Michael Webb joined the band on vocals, guitars, mandolin, keys and accordion in 2010. The band\'s new incarnation continued to tour and record. In early 2012, a live video of a new song, "Neil Young", was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album, \'\'All Fired Up\'\', that was recorded in Nashville and released in February 2013. Selling on [[iTunes]] and the band\'s website, and through a distributor in Europe, Young, Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the self produced album. In its 45th year, Rusty Young was the only original member in the band, and remained the leader and front man on stage.  He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the band\'s inception in 1968.

===Selected studio reissues===
In 1997 \'\'[[From the Inside (Poco album)|From the Inside]]\'\' and \'\'[[A Good Feelin\' to Know]]\'\' were reissued on CD by BGO, a British label. The reissue had some problems though as it appears the tape used to remaster \'\'From the Inside\'\' had significant damage to it. \'\'[[Pickin\' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin\' Up the Pieces]]\'\' and \'\'[[Poco (album)|Poco]]\'\', the band\'s first and second albums, were also reissued during this time, with no noticeable damage to the master tapes. The notes give a brief history of the band and the recording of each album.

In 2006 BGO reissued four more albums, with two albums on each CD: \'\'[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]\'\' with \'\'[[Cantamos]]\'\', the band\'s seventh and eighth albums, and \'\'[[Deliverin\']]\'\', the band\'s first live album, with \'\'[[Crazy Eyes]]\'\'. Neither set had any bonus tracks as part of the reissue although there are extensive sleeve notes about Poco\'s history and the making of the album. The reissues were remastered by Jack Thompson, although it doesn\'t note whether or not these were remastered from the original master tapes or the safety masters as previous CDs were.

In 2011 BGO licensed and reissued remastered editions of four of Poco\'s ABC/MCA titles, again remastered by Thompson, putting two albums on each CD, with extensive liner notes written by John Tobler. The pairings were \'\'[[Head over Heels (Poco album)|Head over Heels]]\'\' with \'\'[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose of Cimarron]]\'\', and \'\'[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]\'\' with \'\'[[Blue and Gray]]\'\'. No bonus tracks or outtakes were included.

===Retirement===
At the end of 2013 Rusty Young announced his retirement. At the age of 68 he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break. A few shows were booked into 2014 including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD document of the band\'s live show. Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before. Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published. He and Sundrud write and record music for children\'s story videos as the "Session Cats". Lawrence, Sundrud and Webb continued to write, record and play in their own projects, and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville, where they live. Young continues to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists.

Poco was inducted into the [http://CMHOF.org/ Colorado Music Hall of Fame] (CMHOF) with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the [[Paramount Theatre (Denver, Colorado)]] on January 9 2015 and included a performance by the following line-up of band members: Paul Cotton, Richie Furay, Timothy B. Schmit, and Rusty Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Eagles-Bassist-Timothy-B-Schmit-to-Reunite-with-Poco-at-Paramount-Theater-in-Denver-20141229|title=Eagles Bassist Timothy B.

\'\'\'Eric Hilliard Nelson\'\'\' (May 8, 1940 \xe2\x80\x93 December 31, 1985) \xe2\x80\x93 known as \'\'\'Ricky Nelson\'\'\', later also as \'\'\'Rick Nelson\'\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 was an American actor, musician and singer-songwriter.  He starred alongside his family in the television series, \'\'[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]\'\' (1952\xe2\x80\x9366), as well as co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]] in [[Howard Hawks]]\'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film, \'\'[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]\'\' (1959). He placed 53 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] between 1957 and 1973 including "[[Poor Little Fool]]" which holds the distinction of being the first #1 song on \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' magazine\'s then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 19 additional Top 10 hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.<ref>Whitburn</ref><ref>Bashe 284</ref> In 1996, he was ranked #49 on TV Guide\'s 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors\' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=December 14\xe2\x80\x9320 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=October 12, 2011 }}</ref>

Nelson began his entertainment career in 1949 playing himself in the radio sitcom series, \'\'The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\'\'. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, \'\'[[Here Come the Nelsons]]\'\'. In 1957, he recorded his first single, debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the #1 album entitled \'\'[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]\'\'. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, "[[Poor Little Fool]]", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for "Most Promising Male Newcomer" after starring in \'\'[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]\'\'. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs.

Nelson and [[Kristin Harmon|Sharon Kristin Harmon]] were married on April 20, 1963, and divorced in December 1982. They had four children: [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Kristine]], twin sons [[Gunnar Nelson|Gunnar Eric]] and [[Matthew Nelson|Matthew Gray]], and Sam Hilliard. On February 14, 1981, a son (Eric Crewe) was born to Nelson and Georgeann Crewe. A blood test in 1985 confirmed that Nelson was the child\'s father. Nelson was engaged to Helen Blair when both were killed in an airplane crash on December 31, 1985.

==Early life==
Ricky Nelson was born on May 8, 1940, at 1:25&nbsp;p.m. at Holy Name Hospital in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].<ref>Bashe 2,16\xe2\x80\x937</ref><ref>Selvin 25</ref><ref>Nelson was called "Ricky" from birth (Bashe 16).</ref> He was the second son of [[big band]] leader [[Ozzie Nelson]], who was of half Swedish descent, and his wife, big band vocalist [[Harriet Hilliard Nelson]] (n\xc3\xa9e Peggy Louise Snyder). Harriett remained in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], with her newborn and her older son [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] while Ozzie toured the nation with the Nelson orchestra.<ref name="Bashe17">Bashe 17</ref> The Nelsons bought a two-story colonial house in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]],<ref name="Bashe17" /><ref>Selvin 26</ref> and, six months after the purchase, moved with son [[David Nelson (actor)|David]] to Hollywood, where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 1941\xe2\x80\x9342 season of [[Red Skelton]]\'s \'\'The Raleigh Cigarette Hour;\'\' Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother.<ref>Bashe 18</ref> In November 1941, the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home: a green and white, two-story, Cape Cod colonial home at 1822&nbsp;Camino Palmero in Los Angeles.<ref name="Bashe19">Bashe 19</ref><ref>Selvin 28</ref> Ricky joined his parents and brother in Los Angeles in 1942.<ref name="Bashe19" />

Ricky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe [[asthma]]. At night, his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen.<ref>Bashe 19\xe2\x80\x9320</ref> He was described by Red Skelton\'s producer [[John Guedel]] as "an odd little kid," likable, shy, introspective, mysterious, and inscrutable.<ref name="Bashe20">Bashe 20</ref> When Skelton was drafted in 1944, Guedel crafted the radio sitcom \'\'[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]\'\' for Ricky\'s parents.<ref name="Bashe20" /><ref>Selvin 29</ref> The show debuted on Sunday, October 8, 1944, to favorable reviews.<ref>Bashe 21</ref><ref>Selvin 30</ref> Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons.<ref>Bashe 22</ref> The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelve-year-old Dave and eight-year-old Ricky joined the show on February 20, 1949, in the episode "Invitation to Dinner."<ref>Bashe 24\xe2\x80\x935</ref><ref>Dennis 15</ref>

[[File:Adv of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson Family 1952.jpg|thumb|The Nelson family, 1952]]
In 1952, the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film \'\'Here Come the Nelsons.\'\' The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio\'s airwaves to television\'s small screen. On October 3, 1952, \'\'[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]\'\' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest-running sitcoms in television history.

==Education==
Nelson attended Gardner Street Public School,<ref>Bashe 23</ref> Bancroft Junior High,<ref>Selvin 47</ref> and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.<ref name="Selvin53">Selvin 53</ref><ref name="Bashe52">Bashe 52</ref><ref>Selvin states Nelson never graduated from Hollywood High (Selvin 85).</ref> He played football at Hollywood High<ref name="Selvin53" /><ref name="Bashe52" /> and represented the school in interscholastic tennis matches.<ref name="Selvin55">Selvin 55</ref> Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the \'\'[[Los Angeles Weekly]]\'\' he hated school because it "smelled of pencils" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.<ref name="Selvin53" />

At Hollywood High, Nelson was blackballed by the Elksters, a fraternity of a dozen conservative sports-loving teens who thought him too wild.<ref name="Bashe55">Bashe 55</ref><ref name="Selvin54">Selvin 54</ref> Many of the Elksters were family friends and spent weekends at the Nelson home playing basketball or relaxing around the pool.<ref name="Selvin54" /> In retaliation, he joined the Rooks, a [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] car club of sideburned high school teens clad in leather jackets and motorcycle boots.<ref name="Selvin54" /><ref name="Bashe56">Bashe 56</ref> He tattooed his hands, wrist, and shoulder with India ink and a sewing needle, slicked his hair with oil, and accompanied the Rooks on nocturnal forays along [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name="Selvin54" /><ref name="Bashe56" /> Nelson was jailed twice in connection with incidents perpetrated by the Rooks and escaped punishment after [[sucker-punch]]ing a police officer only through the intervention of his father.<ref name="Bashe56" /> Nelson\'s parents were alarmed. Their son\'s juvenile delinquency did little to enhance the All-American image of \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\', and they quickly put an end to Ricky\'s involvement with the Rooks by banishing one of the most influential of the club\'s members from Ricky\'s life and their home.<ref name="Selvin55" /> One of Ricky\'s seldom-publicized traits was his "fierce loyalty" to boyhood friends whom he regarded as trusted confidants. When young friend Bill Aken was in a crippling auto accident in New York City and confined to a hospital bed for months, Ricky would often phone Billy\'s mother, asking about his progress and writing short notes and letters to Billy to cheer him up. They became lifelong friends, and Aken recorded the only family-authorized tribute record ("Gentle Friend") for the fan club after Rick\'s death.

Ozzie Nelson was a [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] alumnus and keen on college education,<ref>Selvin 15</ref> but eighteen-year-old Ricky was already in the 93&nbsp;percent income-tax bracket and saw no reason to attend.<ref name="Bashe52" /> At age thirteen, Ricky was making over $100,000 per annum, and at sixteen he had a personal fortune of $500,000.<ref>Bashe 53</ref> Nelson\'s wealth was astutely managed by his parents, who channeled his earnings into trust funds. Although his parents permitted him a $50 allowance at the age of eighteen, Rick was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date.<ref>Bashe 54</ref> Accustomed to affluence, Nelson had a cavalier attitude about money and never managed his finances very well.<ref name="Bashe55" />

==Music career==

===Debut===
Nelson played clarinet and drums in his [[tween (demographic)|tweens]] and early teens, learned the rudimentary guitar chords, and vocally imitated his favorite [[Sun Records]] [[rockabilly]] artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the [[Los Angeles Tennis Club]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}} He was strongly influenced by the music of [[Carl Perkins]] and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkins\'s March 1956 [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]."{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}}

At age sixteen, he wanted to impress a girl friend who was an [[Elvis Presley]] fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=60}}<ref name="Bronson154">Bronson 154</ref>{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}} With his father\'s help, he secured a one-record deal with [[Verve Records]], an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing.<ref name="Bronson154" />{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=69}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}} On March 26, 1957, he recorded the [[Fats Domino]] standard "[[I\'m Walkin\']]" and "[[A Teenager\'s Romance]]" (released in late April 1957 as his first single),<ref name=pc11>{{Pop Chronicles |11| 3}}</ref> and "[[You\'re My One and Only Love]]".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=71}}

Before the single was released, he made his television rock-and-roll debut on April 10, 1957, lip-synching "I\'m Walkin\'" in the \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\' episode "Ricky, the Drummer".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=72}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=66}} About the same time, he made an unpaid public appearance, singing "[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]" with the [[Four Preps]] at a Hamilton High School lunch hour assembly<ref name=pc11/> in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=75}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}}

"[[I\'m Walkin\']]" reached #4 on \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\'\'s Best Sellers in Stores chart, and its flip side, "[[A Teenager\'s Romance]]", hit #2.<ref name="Bronson154" />{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}} When the television series went on summer break in 1957, Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] with the Four Preps, who opened and closed for him.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=70}}

===First album, band, and #1 single===
In early summer 1957, Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative five-year deal with [[Imperial Records]] that gave him approval over song selection, sleeve artwork, and other production details.<ref>Bashe 78\xe2\x80\x939</ref><ref>Selvin 73\xe2\x80\x934</ref> Ricky\'s first Imperial single, "[[Be-Bop Baby]]", generated 750,000 advance orders, sold over one million copies, and reached #3 on the charts. Nelson\'s first album, \'\'Ricky\'\', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.<ref>Selvin 76</ref> Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.<ref name="Bashe80">Bashe 80</ref>

Nelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.<ref>Bashe 81</ref> Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed, living in the Nelson home for two years.<ref>Bashe 82\xe2\x80\x933</ref> Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.<ref name="Bashe83">Bashe 83</ref> Their first recording together was "[[Believe What You Say]]". Rick selected material from demo acetates submitted by songwriters. Ozzie Nelson forbade suggestive lyrics or titles, and his late-night arrival at recording sessions forced band members to hurriedly hide their beers and cigarettes. [[The Jordanaires]], Elvis Presley\'s backup vocalists, worked for Nelson but at Presley\'s behest were not permitted credit on Nelson\'s albums.

In 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]\'s "[[Poor Little Fool]]" for his second album, \'\'Ricky Nelson\'\', released in June 1958.<ref name="Bashe90" /><ref name="Selvin89">Selvin 89</ref> Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.<ref name="Bashe90">Bashe 90</ref><ref name="Selvin89-90">Selvin 89\xe2\x80\x9390</ref> On August 4, 1958, "Poor Little Fool" became the #1 single on \'\'Billboard\'\'\'s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart<ref name="Bashe91">Bashe 91</ref><ref>Selvin 90</ref> and sold over two million copies.<ref name="Bashe90" /> Nelson so loathed the song that he refused to perform it on \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\'.<ref name="Bashe90" /> Sheeley claimed he ruined her song by slowing the tempo.<ref name="Bashe91" /> More generally, Nelson stated

During 1958 and 1959, Nelson placed twelve hits on the charts in comparison with Presley\'s eleven (it should be remembered that the latter was then serving in Germany with the U.S. Army). During the sitcom\'s run, Ozzie Nelson, either to keep his son\'s fans tuned in or as an affirmation of his reputed behind-the-scenes persona as a controlling personality, kept his son from appearing on other television shows that could have enhanced his public profile, \'\'[[American Bandstand]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\' in particular.<ref name="Bashe91"/> In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly.

Nelson was the first teen idol to utilize television to promote hit records. Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for "Travelin\' Man."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nelson finally did appear on the Sullivan show in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of \'\'[[The Streets of San Francisco]]\'\' in which he played the part of a hippie flute-playing leader of a harem of young prostitutes. He starred in the episode "A Hand For Sonny Blue" from the 1977 series \'\'[[Quinn Martin\'s Tales of the Unexpected]]\'\' (known in the United Kingdom as \'\'Twist in the Tale\'\').<ref>[http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm Classic Television Archive: Quinn Martin\'s Tales of the Unexpected (1977)]</ref> In 1979, he guest-hosted on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\', spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a \'\'[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]\'\' sendup in which, always trying to go "home," he finds himself among the characters from other 1950s/early 1960s-era sitcoms, \'\'[[Leave It to Beaver]]\'\', \'\'[[Father Knows Best]]\'\', \'\'[[Make Room for Daddy]]\'\', and \'\'[[I Love Lucy]]\'\'.

Nelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a [[teen idol]], largely because of his parents\' musical background. Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].

From 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and Pat Boone (38). Many of Nelson\'s early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' charts.

While Nelson preferred [[rockabilly]] and [[uptempo]] rock [[songs]] like "[[Believe What You Say]]" (Hot 100 #4), "[[I Got a Feeling (Ricky Nelson song)|I Got a Feeling]]" (#10), "[[My Bucket\'s Got a Hole in It]]" (#12), "[[Hello Mary Lou]]" (#9), "It\'s Late" (#9), "[[Stood Up (song)|Stood Up]]" (#2), "[[Waitin\' In School (song)|Waitin\' in School]]" (#18), "[[Be-Bop Baby]]" (#3), and "[[Just a Little Too Much]]" (#9), his smooth, calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads. He had major success with "[[Travelin\' Man]]" (#1), "[[A Teenager\'s Romance]]" (#2), "Poor Little Fool" (#1), "[[Young World (song)|Young World]]" (#5), "[[Lonesome Town]]" (#7), "[[Never Be Anyone Else But You]]" (#6), "[[Sweeter Than You]]" (#9), "[[It\'s Up to You (Ricky Nelson song)|It\'s Up to You]]" (#6), and "[[Teen Age Idol]]" (#5), which clearly could have been about Nelson himself.

==Film actor==
[[File:Howard Hawks\'Rio Bravo trailer (33-2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Nelson in \'\'Rio Bravo\'\', 1959]]
In addition to his recording career, Nelson appeared in movies, including the [[Howard Hawks]] western classic \'\'[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]\'\' with [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], and [[Walter Brennan]] (1959), plus \'\'[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]\'\' (1960) with [[Jack Lemmon]] and \'\'[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]\'\' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].

==Name change==
On May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from "Ricky Nelson" to "Rick Nelson". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on "Ozzie and Harriet". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and "Ricky" were the last of the "rockabilly breed."

In 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964\'s "For You" (#6), Nelson\'s chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[The British Invasion]].

In the mid 1960s, Nelson began to move towards [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called "[[California Sound]]" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands like the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]\'s "She Belongs to Me" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]] and [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].

=="Garden Party"==
[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on \'\'The Jim Nabors Show\'\' in 1970]]
In 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with "[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]", a song he wrote in disgust after a Richard Nader Oldies Concert at Madison Square Garden where the audience booed him, because, he felt, he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits. When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]\' "[[Honky Tonk Women]]", he was booed off the stage. He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage and Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his "oldies". He returned to the stage and played his "oldies" and the audience responed with a applause according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire \'\'Garden Party\'\' album yet. "Garden Party" reached #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|\'\'Billboard\'\' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was "Palace Guard" which peaked at #65.

Nelson was with MCA at the time, and his comeback was short-lived. Nelson\'s band soon resigned, and MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. His band moved to Aspen and changed their name to "Canyon". Nelson soon put together a new Stone Canyon Band and began to tour for the \'\'[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]\'\' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of \'\'Garden Party\'\'. In 1974 MCA was at odds as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like \'\'[[Windfall (album)|Windfall]]\'\' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott\'s Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.

Nelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like "Rock and Roll Lady." With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.

Nelson studied [[karate]], earning a brown belt before going on to learn [[Jeet Kune Do]] under [[Dan Inosanto]]. Inosanto described Nelson as a "good martial artist for those times."<ref>Kelly 145</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky\'s girlfriend in three episodes of \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\'.<ref name="Bashe136">Bashe 136</ref><ref>Selvin 72</ref> Nelson and Gaba were too young to entertain a serious relationship, although according to Gaba "we used to neck \'\'for hours\'\'."<ref>Bashe 137</ref><ref>Selvin 73</ref> The next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called \'\'Town Hall Party\'\'.<ref>Bashe 106</ref><ref>Selvin 81</ref> The two wrote Nelson\'s first composition, the song "My Gal," and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]]. Collins appeared in an \'\'Ozzie and Harriet\'\' episode as Ricky\'s girlfriend and sang "Just Because" with him in the musical finale.<ref name="Selvin83">Selvin 83</ref> They went steady and discussed marriage, but their parents discouraged the idea.<ref name="Selvin83" /><ref name="Bashe138">Bashe 138</ref>

At the age of 45, Nelson said the only girl he ever really loved was involved with him for two years in the late 1950s. After she became pregnant and had a nearly fatal abortion, she married another man.<ref>Selvin 116</ref><ref name="Bashe 145">Bashe 145</ref>

===Kris Harmon===
[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Rick and Kris Nelson, 1964]]
At Christmas 1961, Nelson began dating [[Kristin Harmon|Sharon Kristin "Kris" Harmon]] (born June 25, 1945), the daughter of football legend [[Tom Harmon]] and actress [[Elyse Knox]] (n\xc3\xa9e Elsie Kornbrath) and the older sister of [[Kelly Harmon|Kelly]] and [[Mark Harmon]].<ref>Bashe 138,140\xe2\x80\x931</ref><ref>Selvin 140</ref> The Nelsons and the Harmons had long been friends, and a union between their children held great appeal.<ref>Bashe 139</ref> Rick and Kris had much in common: quiet dispositions, Hollywood upbringings, and high-powered, domineering fathers.<ref>Bashe 140</ref>

They married on April 20, 1963. Kris was pregnant,<ref name="Selvin149">Selvin 149</ref> and Rick later described the union as a "[[shotgun wedding]]."<ref name="Bashe144">Bashe 144</ref> Nelson, a nonpracticing Protestant, received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the bride\'s parents<ref name="Bashe144"/><ref>Selvin 137,149</ref> and signed a pledge to have any children of the union baptized in the Catholic faith.<ref name="Selvin149" /> Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963.<ref name="Bashe 145" /><ref>Selvin 150</ref> They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Kristine Nelson]], twin sons [[Gunnar Nelson|Gunnar Eric Nelson]] and [[Matthew Nelson|Matthew Gray Nelson]] who formed the band [[Nelson (band)|Nelson]], and Sam Hilliard Nelson.

By 1975, following the birth of their last child, the marriage had deteriorated and a very public, controversial divorce involving both families was covered in the press for several years. In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.<ref name="Selvin230">Selvin 230</ref> According to a Nelson biographer, Kris was contentious and jealous. Both spent enormous sums of money: Kris on parties, Rick on renting a private Lear jet.<ref>Selvin 236, 238</ref> Nelson had a tremendous sexual appetite and a casual attitude toward sex, once estimating he had had sex with thousands of women.<ref>Bashe 205</ref> Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris\'s extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.<ref>Selvin 251</ref> The impasse over Rick\'s career created unpleasantness at home. Kris became an alcoholic and left the children in the care of household help.<ref name="Bashe218">Bashe 218</ref> After years of legal proceedings, they were divorced in December 1982. The divorce was financially devastating for Nelson, with attorneys and accountants taking over $1&nbsp;million.<ref>Bashe 221</ref> Years of legal wrangling followed.<ref>Bashe 237</ref><ref>Selvin 262</ref>

===Georgeann Crewe===
On May 16, 1980, Nelson met Georgeann Crewe at the Playboy Resort in Great Gorge, New Jersey.<ref name="Bashe229">Bashe 229</ref><ref name="Selvin277">Selvin 277</ref> Crewe later claimed she felt "an attachment, an immediate attraction" to Nelson.<ref name="Bashe229" /><ref name="Selvin277" /> Crewe unsuccessfully attempted to contact Nelson several times to let him know that she was pregnant, and on February 14, 1981, she gave birth to Nelson\'s son, Eric Jude Crewe.<ref name="Bashe229" /> In 1985, a blood test confirmed Nelson was the father,<ref name="Bashe229" /> but Nelson was not interested in Crewe or their son. He declined to meet with them to the point that he avoided playing concerts in Atlantic City. Although Nelson agreed to provide $400 a month in child support, he did not provide for the child in his will.<ref name="Bashe 271">Bashe 271</ref>

===Helen Blair===
In 1980, Nelson met Helen Blair, a part-time model and exotic animal trainer, in Las Vegas.<ref name="Bashe242" /> Within months of their meeting, she became his road companion, and in 1982 she moved in with him. She was the only woman he dated after his divorce.<ref name="Bashe242">Bashe 242</ref><ref name="Selvin260">Selvin 260</ref>

Blair acted as personal assistant to Nelson, organizing his day and acting as a liaison for his fan club,<ref name="Bashe242" /> but Nelson\'s mother, brother, business manager, and manager disapproved of her presence in his life.<ref>Bashe 242,244</ref> He contemplated marrying her but eventually declined.<ref name="Bashe246">Bashe 246</ref> Blair died with Nelson in the airplane fire. Her name was never mentioned at Nelson\'s funeral.<ref name="Bashe273">Bashe 273</ref> Blair\'s parents wanted their daughter buried next to Nelson at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Cemetery]], but Harriet Nelson dismissed the idea.<ref name="Bashe244">Bashe 244</ref> The Blairs refused to bury Helen\'s remains and filed a $2&nbsp;million [[wrongful death]] suit against Nelson\'s estate.<ref name="Bashe273" /> They received a small settlement. Nelson did not provide for Blair in his will.<ref name="Bashe 271" />

===Drug use===
Nelson used [[marijuana]] early in his musical career, and became a regular user. He buried his stash in his yard.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} He supported marijuana\'s legalization. He tried [[mescaline]] and was a regular [[cocaine]] user, carrying the drug in an empty [[ginseng]] capsule.<ref>Selvin 113,185</ref><ref>Selvin 240</ref>

During the Nelson divorce proceedings, he was accused by his wife\'s attorney of using cocaine, [[quaaludes]], and other drugs, and of having "a severe drug problem" encouraged by his managers, his entourage, and his groupies. The attorney noted that Nelson\'s "personal manager" secured drugs for Nelson, that wild parties took place in his home whether he was present or not, and that his children, aware of his drug use, were in great physical danger from drugged persons entering and exiting the house at all hours.<ref>Selvin 257</ref> Following Nelson\'s divorce, while he was involved with Helen Blair, his drug use grew so dire that friends urged him to seek treatment for substance abuse.<ref>Selvin 261</ref>

Traces of cocaine, marijuana, and the painkiller [[Dextropropoxyphene|Darvon]] were found in Nelson\'s blood in tests conducted after his death.<ref>{{cite web|title=

==Death==
Nelson dreaded flying but refused to travel by bus. In May 1985, he decided he needed a private plane and leased a luxurious, fourteen-seat, 1944 [[Douglas DC-3]] that had once belonged to the [[DuPont]] family and later to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. The plane had been plagued by a history of mechanical problems.<ref>Bashe 259</ref> In one incident, the band was forced to push the plane off the runway after an engine blew, and in another incident, a malfunctioning [[ignition magneto|magneto]] prevented Nelson from participating in the first [[Farm Aid]] concert in [[Champaign, Illinois]].

On December 26, 1985, Nelson and the band left for a three-stop tour of the Southern United States. Following shows in [[Orlando, Florida]], and [[Guntersville, Alabama]], Nelson and band members took off from Guntersville for a New Year\'s Eve extravaganza in [[Dallas]], Texas.<ref>Bashe 261\xe2\x80\x932</ref> The plane crash-landed northeast of Dallas in [[De Kalb, Texas]], less than two miles from a landing strip, at approximately 5:14&nbsp;pm. CST on December 31, 1985, hitting trees as it came to earth. Seven of the nine occupants were killed: Nelson and his companion, Helen Blair; bass guitarist Patrick Woodward, drummer Rick Intveld, keyboardist [[Andy Chapin]], guitarist Bobby Neal, and road manager/soundman Donald Clark Russell. Pilots Ken Ferguson and Brad Rank escaped via cockpit windows, though Ferguson was severely burned.

Nelson\'s remains were misdirected in transit from Texas to California, delaying the funeral for several days. On January 6, 1986, 250 mourners entered the Church of the Hills for funeral services while 700 fans gathered outside. Attendees included [[Colonel Tom Parker|\'Colonel\' Tom Parker]], [[Connie Stevens]], [[Angie Dickinson]], and dozens of actors, writers, and musicians. Nelson was privately buried days later in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{Find a Grave|1602}}</ref> Kris Nelson threatened to sue the Nelson clan for her former husband\'s life insurance money and tried to wrest control of his estate from David Nelson, its administrator. Her bid was rejected by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge. Nelson bequeathed his entire estate to his children and did not provide for Eric Crewe or Kris Nelson. Only days after the funeral, rumors and newspaper reports suggested cocaine [[freebasing]] was one of several possible causes for the plane crash. Those allegations were refuted by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB).<ref>{{cite news|title=Free-Basing Ruled Out in Nelson Crash|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-28/news/mn-3328_1_nelson-crash|accessdate=October 2, 2011|newspaper=United Press International|date=May 28, 1987}}</ref>

Reports vary as to whether or not the plane was on fire before it crashed. According to witnesses, the plane appeared to be on fire before it crash-landed. However Jim Burnett, then-Chairman of the NTSB, said that even though the plane was filled with smoke, it landed and came to a stop before it was swallowed by flames.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jack|title=Probers Look to 2 Survivors for Clues in Crash That Killed Rick Nelson|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-03/local/me-23919_1_rick-nelson|accessdate=October 2, 2011|newspaper=LA Times|date= January 3, 1986}}</ref> The NTSB conducted a year-long investigation and finally concluded that, while a definite cause was still unknown, the crash was probably due to a fire that was caused by the plane\'s cabin heater "acting up".<ref>{{cite web

When questioned by the NTSB, pilots Brad Rank and Ken Ferguson had different accounts of key events. According to co-pilot Ferguson, the cabin heater was acting up after the plane took off. Ferguson continued that Rank kept going to the back of the plane to see if he could get the heater to function correctly and that Rank told Ferguson several times to turn the heater back on. "One of the times, I refused to turn it on," said Ferguson. He continued, "I was getting more nervous. I didn\'t think we should be messing with that heater en-route." After the plane crashed, Ferguson and Rank climbed out the windows, suffering from extensive burns. They shouted to the passenger cabin, but there was no response. Ferguson and Rank backed away from the plane, fearing explosion. Ferguson stated that Rank told him, "Don\'t tell anyone about the heater, don\'t tell anyone about the heater."<ref name="Pagano, 1987" />

Pilot Rank, however, told a different story: Rank said that he was checking on the passengers when he noticed smoke in the middle of the cabin, where Rick Nelson and Helen Blair were sitting. Even though he never mentioned a problematic heater, Rank stated that he went to the rear of the plane to check the heater, saw no smoke, and found the heater was cool to the touch. After activating an automatic fire extinguisher and opening the cabin\'s fresh air inlets, Rank said that he returned to the cockpit where Ferguson was already asking traffic controllers for directions to the nearest airfield.<ref name="Pagano, 1987" />

Rank was criticized by the NTSB for not following the in-flight fire check-list, opening the fresh air vents instead of leaving them closed, not instructing the passengers to use supplemental oxygen, and not attempting to fight the fire with the hand-held fire extinguisher that was in the cockpit. The board said that while these steps might not have prevented the crash, "they would have enhanced the potential for survival of the passengers."<ref name="Pagano, 1987" /> The words of the NTSB seem to echo that of fire-fighter, Lewis Glover, who was one of the first on the scene. Glover stated, "All the bodies are there at the front of the plane. Apparently, they were trying to escape the fire."<ref>{{cite web|last=Beitler|first=Stu|title=De Kalb, TX Rick Nelson Dies in Airplane Crash, Dec 1985|url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/texas/3622/de-kalb,-tx-rick-nelson-dies-airplane-crash,-dec-1985|publisher=GenDisasters|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref>

An examination indicated that a fire had originated on the right side of the [[aft]] cabin area at or near the floor line. Some reports said the passengers were killed when the aircraft struck obstacles during the forced landing. The ignition and fuel sources of the fire could not be determined.<ref name="DCA86AA012">{{cite web|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/aviation/GenPDF.aspx?id=DCA86AA012&rpt=fi|title=NTSB Report DCA86AA012 File No. 2932|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref> According to another report, the pilot indicated that the crew repeatedly tried to turn on the [[Gasoline heater|gasoline cabin heater]] shortly before the fire occurred, but that it failed to respond. After the fire, the access panel to the heater compartment was found unlatched. The theory is supported by records that showed that [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3s]] in general, and this aircraft in particular, had a history of problems with the cabin heaters.

\'\'\'The Rockingbirds\'\'\' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[country-rock]] band, formed in [[London]] in 1990. They disbanded in 1995, but reformed in 2008 for the Heavenly Records 18th Anniversary shows. They began to tour again in spring 2009 and played the 2009 Glastonbury festival.

==History==

===1990-1995===
The band\'s original line-up featured songwriter Alan Tyler (lead vocals and acoustic guitar), Sean Read (backing vocals and tambourine), Andrew Hackett (electric guitar), Patrick Arbuthnot (pedal steel guitar), Dave (aka Greenwood) Goulding (bass) and drummer Dave Morgan both formerly of [[The Weather Prophets|Weather Prophets]].<ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165436|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Rockingbirds biography\t|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> Their first single release on Heavenly Records was 1991\'s "A Good Day For You Is A Good Day For Me", followed by a tribute song to [[Jonathan Richman]] entitled "Jonathan, Jonathan" in 1992. That same year also saw the release of their eponymously titled debut album (produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]]), which included the "Gradually Learning" single. This gained some radio play and Heavenly (backed by a [[Sony]] distribution deal) produced a video filmed in Austin, Texas. 

In November 1992 Heavenly released \'\'[[The Fred EP]]\'\', which featured The Rockingbirds\' cover of "[[Deeply Dippy]]", which provided the group with their only chart hit, and their only [[Top Of The Pops]] appearance.

1993 saw Heavenly release a 4 track E.P. entitled \'\'Rockingbirds-R-Us\'\' featuring brand new songs. The band\'s new line-up now featured Tim Kent on banjo, Chris Clarke replacing Goulding on bass, and new drummer Trevor Smith. Their second album, \'\'Whatever Happened to the Rockingbirds?\'\', was released in 1995 via [[Cooking Vinyl]] and featured production from [[Edwyn Collins]]. This was preceded by a single "Band Of Dreams" - released on 7" vinyl only -  but the band split a few months later in November \'95, with a farewell gig at The Garage in North London.<ref name="ready-steady-go">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ready-steady-go.org.uk/rockingbirds.htm|title=The Rockingbirds - When Camden went country!|publisher=Ready-Steady-Go|accessdate=2009-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><br />Alan Tyler has continued to record and play live both as a solo-performer and with his new band [[Alan Tyler and the Lost Sons of Littlefield]]. The new band includes Rockingbirds bass player Chris Clarke and occasionally Sean Read.

===The Return of the Rockingbirds===
After reforming for a Heavenly Records 18th Anniversary show at London\'s Royal Festival Hall in 2008 The Rockingbirds played a series of gigs in April 2009 to support a 2-disc re-issue of the first album. This remastered version now features tracks from the \'\'Rockingbirds-R-Us EP\'\' as well as B-sides and live tracks culled from the single releases. A 500 run limited edition 7" single of new Rockingbirds material was also released on 6 April 2009 featuring the tracks "Man In The Moon" / "Lookingback Lullaby".<ref name="garratt">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/content/GoingOut/story.aspx?brand=ENOnline&category=GoingOutMusic&tBrand=ENOnline&tCategory=GoingOutMusic&itemid=NOED14%20Apr%202009%2012%3A19%3A35%3A100|title=Interview: The Rockingbirds|last=Garratt|first=Rob|date=14 April 2009|publisher=[[Norwich Evening News]]|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> They recently featured on the front cover of the 60th anniversary edition of weekly music magazine \'\'[[NME]]\'\'.<ref name="nme">{{Cite web|url=http://twitter.com/FamousTimes/status/250990560419139584|title=The Rockingbirds NME front Cover| publisher=[[NME]]|accessdate=2012-09-26}}</ref> In 2013 they released their first new album in 18 years, \'\'The Return of the Rockingbirds\'\', on Loose Music.

\'\'\'Social Distortion\'\'\' is an American [[punk rock]] band formed in 1978 in [[Fullerton, California]].<ref name="history" /> The band currently consists of [[Mike Ness]] (lead vocals, lead guitar), [[Jonny Wickersham]] (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), [[Brent Harding]] (bass, backing vocals), [[David Hidalgo, Jr.]] (drums), and [[David Kalish]] (keys).

Social Distortion went on a temporary hiatus in the mid-1980s, due to frontman Ness\' drug addiction and troubles with the law which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers that lasted for two years. Since its inception, the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent with many members coming and going \xe2\x80\x93 Ness has been the only constant member. After {{Age|1978|1|1}} years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music.

To date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two [[compilation album|compilations]], one live album, and two [[DVDs]]. They released two albums \xe2\x80\x94 \'\'[[Mommy\'s Little Monster]]\'\' (1983) and \'\'[[Prison Bound]]\'\' (1988) \xe2\x80\x94 before signing a three-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which produced their well-known hit singles "[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]", "[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]", and the cover of [[Johnny Cash]]\'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", and was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&title=social_distortion&artist=social_distortion&perPage=25 |title=RIAA Gold & Platinum Database |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Many of their later albums, including their second gold record<ref name="RIAA" /> \'\'[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]\'\' (1992), were also well received.

==History==

===Early years (1978\xe2\x80\x9382)===
Social Distortion was formed in late 1978 by frontman [[Mike Ness]], inspired by [[The Sex Pistols]] and many other British punk bands as well as [[Rock music|rock]] acts such as [[The Rolling Stones]]. The original lineup consisted of Ness on lead guitar, [[Rikk Agnew|Rikk]] and [[Frank Agnew]] on guitars, and [[Casey Royer]] on drums.<ref name="history" /> Ness met [[Dennis Danell]], who was a year older, in high school and insisted he join the band on bass guitar even though Danell had never played an instrument before. When Danell was brought in, Frank, Rikk, and Casey left to join [[The Adolescents]].<ref name="history" /> Mike and Dennis remained the only constant members for the next two decades with bass and drum members changing every few years. The Adolescents song "Kids of the Black Hole" and Social Distortion song "The Playpen" chronicled this period of the band\'s history.

Its first single, \'\'Mainliner/Playpen\'\' featuring Ness on guitar and vocals, Dennis on bass, and Carrot on drums was released in 1981 on [[Posh Boy]], the label responsible for releasing the first singles and albums of many of the local O.C. punk bands.<ref name="history" /> A disc jockey by the name of [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] of [[KROQ-FM]] was responsible for much of the radio play in [[Orange County, California]], that punk received in the early 80s, and took a liking to Social Distortion, releasing the single "1945" on his 1981 compilation album, \'\'Rodney on the ROQ\'\', \'\'Blood on the ROQ\'\' in 1983, and \'\'The Best Of Rodney on the ROQ\'\' in 1989.

In 1982, the band\xe2\x80\x94now consisting of Ness, Danell (who now played rhythm guitar), [[Brent Liles]] on bass, and [[Derek O\'Brien (drummer)|Derek O\'Brien]] on drums\xe2\x80\x94embarked on their first international tour (US and Canada) with fellow punk band [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]], a trip chronicled in the punk [[rockumentary]] \'\'[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]\'\', which was not released until 1984.

===\'\'Mommy\'s Little Monster\'\' and first hiatus (1983\xe2\x80\x9385)===
Upon its return from the \'\'Another State of Mind\'\' tour in 1982, they recorded their debut album, \'\'[[Mommy\'s Little Monster]]\'\'. The album was released in early 1983 on their own label, [[13th Floor Records]]. \'\'Mommy\'s Little Monster\'\' includes the title track as well as the song for which the previous tour was named, "[[Another State of Mind (song)|Another State of Mind]]". This was the album that "gained the band a national name in punk circles".<ref name="history">[http://www.socialdistortion.com/history/ "A Brief History of Social Distortion"]. SocialDistortion.com.

In 1984 the band was featured in the seminal punk rockumentary, Another State of Mind, which was written, produced and directed by Peter Stuart and Adam Small (co-creator of "Mad TV").

Ness mentions in his DVD commentary that he really had nowhere to stay when he got back to California after the tour ended, so he would crash on the couch of whoever would have him. He details how he plunged headfirst into serious drug addiction and ended up being strung out on heroin for weeks at a time. In 1983, Liles and O\'Brien left the band in the middle of a show on New Year\'s Eve, and were replaced soon thereafter by Ness\' high school friend [[John Maurer]] and a man named [[Bob Stubbs]]. This line-up lasted only a short time until [[Christopher Reece]] joined on drums.<ref name="history" /> Ness\'s drug habit continued throughout 1984 and 1985 as the band continued to gain success with \'\'Another State of Mind\'\' appearing as one of the punk rarities on MTV, and touring in California and Arizona. As a result of Ness\'s escalating drug habit and troubles with the law, Social Distortion briefly went on hiatus in 1985. During this time, Ness was in and out of various rehabilitation centers and jails.

===First comeback and \'\'Prison Bound\'\' (1986\xe2\x80\x9388)===
The band reformed in or around 1986, once Ness finished his [[drug rehabilitation]] program. It released its second album, \'\'[[Prison Bound]]\'\', two years later in 1988\xe2\x80\x94over five years after their debut. The album included then-newcomers John Maurer on bass and Christopher Reece on drums. Although \'\'Prison Bound\'\' never charted on [[Billboard magazine|\'\'Billboard\'\']], the title track still receives extensive airplay on Los Angeles radio station, [[KROQ-FM]].

A notable style change takes place in \'\'Prison Bound\'\'. While \'\'Mommy\'s Little Monster\'\' falls under the general category of [[punk rock]] or [[hardcore punk]], \'\'Prison Bound\'\' takes on a definite [[country music|country/western]] flavor and marks the start of the band\'s entrance into a style sometimes called "[[cowpunk]]." Country legend [[Johnny Cash]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]\' [[honky tonk]] style became more prominent influences on Social Distortion\'s music at this time. There are references to Cash and the Stones in the songs "Prison Bound" and "On My Nerves," and they also cover a Stones song titled "Backstreet Girl," which has a [[Major scale|major key]] sound that foreshadows the more focused cowpunk sound of the later albums.

Five years had passed since releasing its debut. The success was just beginning and, in fact, taking time between albums became a pattern for Social Distortion. Ness acknowledges in a 2003 interview that it \'\'is\'\' a little backward, marketing-wise, to play songs for the fans for a few years before recording them\xe2\x80\x94but it has always worked well for them. "We know which songs are going to be fan favorites on the record before we even record them."<ref>Steininger, Alex.

===Major label years and mainstream success (1989\xe2\x80\x9396)===
After the release of \'\'Prison Bound\'\', Social Distortion left [[Restless Records]] and signed with [[Epic Records|Epic]]. The band then returned to the studio around the summer/fall of 1989, with producer [[Dave Jerden]], to begin recording their [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which was released in 1990. It was Social Distortion\'s first album that was not financed by the band.<ref name="history" /> The album includes the singles "[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]" and \'[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]" as well as a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]\'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". The self-titled album fared better than both \'\'Mommy\'s Little Monster\'\' and \'\'Prison Bound,\'\' and is often credited as Social Distortion\'s best known work, with sales continuing {{Age|1990|3|27}} years after its release. It is also sometimes cited as among the best rock albums of 1990\xe2\x80\x94the album is said to "split the difference between [[rockabilly]] and Ramones-style punk."<ref>[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,991908,00.html "Social Distortion (import bonus tracks) \xe2\x80\x93 Album reviews"]. ArtistDirect.com. Retrieved on February 24, 2007.</ref>

The fourth album, \'\'[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]\'\', was released in 1992. The album included two hit singles\xe2\x80\x94"[[Bad Luck (Social Distortion song)|Bad Luck]]", and "When She Begins". \'\'Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\'\' surpassed all their previous albums in popularity. The album has a similar sound to the previous, eponymous, album, said to be a blend of "punk, blues, country and rockabilly".<ref name="ADbio">[http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,495103,00.html#bio "Social Distortion Bio"] ArtistDirect.com. Retrieved on February 24, 2007.</ref> After the release of this album, drummer [[Christopher Reece]] left Social Distortion in 1994 and was replaced by [[Randy Carr]]. Carr toured with the band and played drums on live performances until he left in 1995.

The band took another hiatus after the release of \'\'Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\'\', and did not return to the studio until 1995.<ref name="history" /> During the break, Social Distortion released a compilation album, \'\'[[Mainliner: Wreckage From the Past]]\'\' (1995), featuring pre-\'\'[[Mommy\'s Little Monster]]\'\' cuts. It contains two versions of "1945" and "Playpen" from their two indie labels, 13th Floor, and [[Posh Boy Records|Posh Boy]], and also a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]]\' "[[Under My Thumb]]".

In June 1994, the band began demoing songs for the fifth album,<ref name="demo">[http://rateyourmusic.com/release/unauth/social_distortion/lost_tracks_ii__the_june_1994_demos/ "Lost Tracks II: The June 1994 Demos"] RateYourMusic.com.

The album also included a re-recorded version of "Under My Thumb", a cover of The Rolling Stones, as a [[hidden track]]. Former [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] drummer [[Chuck Biscuits]] joined the band between the recording and release of the album, and is credited in the liner notes although this album actually features session drummer [[Eddie Livingston]].<ref name="sputnik">[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=5485 "Social Distortion: White Light White Heat White Trash"] SputnickMusic.com. Retrieved on February 24, 2007</ref> \'\'White Light, White Heat, White Trash\'\' was the final Social Distortion album recorded with [[Dennis Danell]] before his death.

===Second hiatus, Danell\'s death and \'\'Sex, Love and Rock \'n\' Roll\'\' (1997\xe2\x80\x932004)===
In 1997, Social Distortion left Epic and returned to [[Time Bomb Recordings]] for the first time in eight years. It released its first (and only) live album, \'\'[[Live at the Roxy (Social Distortion album)|Live at the Roxy]]\'\' in 1998. Social Distortion went on hiatus again as Ness went solo, releasing two albums, \'\'[[Cheating at Solitaire]]\'\' and \'\'[[Under the Influences]],\'\' featuring song covers, in 1999.

Dennis Danell died on February 29, 2000 in his Newport Beach home after apparently suffering a brain [[aneurysm]], leaving Ness as the only remaining original member of the band. There have been some rumors claiming that the band broke up again, following his death. He was replaced by former [[U.S. Bombs]], Cadillac Tramps and L.A.\'s [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]] guitarist [[Jonny Wickersham]], who had previously been Danell\'s guitar technician. Biscuits also left during that time, and was replaced by [[Charlie Quintana]]. After Danell\'s death, the band continued touring semi-frequently, playing sold-out shows in the Los Angeles area around the New Year for three straight years.

[[File:Hamburg~41.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The band\'s 2004\xe2\x80\x9309 lineup, left to right: Wickersham, Harding, Quintana, and Ness]]
Social Distortion started work on the follow-up to \'\'White Light, White Heat, White Trash\'\' in 2000, which was originally to be released in the fall of that year,<ref name="sixthalbum">[http://www.sxdx.com/news.html SxDx.com News] [http://www.sxdx.com/news.html SxDx.com]. Retrieved on February 26, 2007.</ref> but it was not completed. Since 2001, due to the band\'s ongoing tour schedule, the album\'s release was put on hold several times. In the fall of 2003, after completing demos, Social Distortion returned to the studio with producer Cameron Webb to complete the album.<ref name="sixthalbum"/> \'\'[[Sex, Love and Rock \'n\' Roll]]\'\', released on September 28, 2004, would be the band\'s first release with Wickersham and Quintana. Just a month before the release of the album, longtime bassist [[John Maurer]] left the band to stay with his family, and was replaced by [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]\'s [[Matt Freeman]]. He stayed until late 2004, and was replaced by current bassist [[Brent Harding]].

===Subsequent activities and departure of Quintana (2005\xe2\x80\x9309)===
Social Distortion continued touring on and off between 2005 and 2007. The band was scheduled to headline the [[Soundwave Festival]] in Australia in February\xe2\x80\x93March 2008, along with [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and [[The Offspring]], but they cancelled their appearance and released the following statement:

<blockquote>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Social Distortion is regrettably unable to perform at Soundwave Festival 2008 in Australia and must officially withdraw from the bill. We apologise for any inconvenience to our Australian fans and hope to make it there as soon as possible.</blockquote>

During this time, the band played with various other bands, including [[Versus the World (band)|Versus the World]], [[Tsar (band)|Tsar]], [[Shooter Jennings]], [[I Hate Kate]], [[The Black Halos]], [[Flogging Molly]], [[Nine Black Alps]], [[Supersuckers]], [[Blackpool Lights]], The [[Lost City Angels]], The [[Street Dogs]], The [[Backyard Babies]], [[The Hangmen]], [[The Eyeliners]], [[Cooper (band)|Cooper]], [[The Stun Gunz]], [[Mest]], [[Bullets and Octane]], and [[The Dead 60s]].

In February 2006, Ness was injured and broke his wrist in a [[skateboard]]ing accident. For several months, [[T.S.O.L.]] guitarist [[Ron Emory]] and [[The Hangmen]]\'s Bryan Small played guitar while Ness sang with his arm in a cast and sling.

Original member [[Brent Liles]], who played bass on \'\'Mommy\'s Little Monster,\'\' died on January 18, 2007 after being hit by a [[semi-trailer truck|semi truck]] while riding a [[dirt bike]] in [[Placentia, California]].<ref name="liles">[http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/homepage/abox/article_1550716.php "Early Social Distortion bassist ID\'d in wreck"].

Social Distortion released its first \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Social Distortion album)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' compilation on June 26, 2007. It includes hit singles from \'\'[[Mommy\'s Little Monster]]\'\' to \'\'[[Sex, Love and Rock \'n\' Roll]]\'\', yet lacks any song from \'\'[[Mainliner: Wreckage From the Past|Mainliner]]\'\'. Along with a new studio recording of the song, "[[Far Behind (Social Distortion song)|Far Behind]]", new studio recordings of 6 of their classic songs are included as well. Rerecording these songs allowed the band to own rights to them again, instead of Epic (their former label) owning them. Through iTunes in the U.S., as a download only, the Greatest Hits also includes a new Social Distortion cover version of the Chuck Berry classic "Maybellene". Ness stated in an interview that this \'\'Greatest Hits\'\' technically means "what was good with radio."<ref>{{cite web|last=Coddon |first=David L. |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20070517-9999-lz1w17ness.html |title=News > Features - Mike Ness wants to have a few words with you |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=May 17, 2007 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}</ref> Ness also stated in the same interview that "we may follow this up with something that is more essential Social D. \xe2\x80\x93 songs that are the band\'s favorites."

In April 2008, Ness told Spinner that Social Distortion was planning an acoustic album to be released in 2009, stating "I think it could be really, really neat. It\'s almost like a [[Bob Dylan]]/[[Bruce Springsteen]]/[[Johnny Cash]] kind of feel with a punk edge ... but acoustic. Sometimes [the songs] are more powerful stripped down than with full volume." Ness also revealed plans for his next solo album, but he was not sure if it was going to be released before or after the follow-up to \'\'Sex, Love and Rock \'n\' Roll\'\' or the acoustic album.<ref>[http://www.aol.spinner.com/2008/04/02/social-distortion-unplug-on-new-album/ Social Distortion Unplug on New Album].

In a February 2010 interview with Spinner, Ness revealed that the band had just tracked 12 songs, and was "going to probably track another five". He says the self-produced, still-untitled album, which he hopes to release before the end of the year, will feature the classic Social Distortion sound \xe2\x80\x93 a combination of punk, rockabilly and country, presumably. He explained, "It\'s funny \xe2\x80\x93 the record reminds me very much of \'\'[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]\'\', but also I\'m bringing elements of early New York \'70s punk, influences that maybe haven\'t come out as prominently in my writing in the past. It\'s a little more [[Johnny Thunders]]. Some of the early first wave of punk was very blues-based rock \'n\' roll, but it had this urban snottiness to it." Ness also explained what happened to the acoustic album, which was announced back in 2008, "The acoustic thing is just a future project, which I think will be significant and equally important. But as far as the priority goes, it\'s more important now to get a studio record out that is a regular record".<ref>[http://www.spinner.com/2010/02/16/social-distortion-new-album/ Social Distortion\'s New Album to Sound Like \'Dead Boys Meets Black Crowes\'].

==Musical style, influences, and impact==
Social Distortion\'s musical style began as decidedly punk rock or hardcore punk when the band formed in the late 1970s. They are thought to be one of the pioneering bands of the original Southern California punk rock movement out of [[Orange County, California]], and their style closely associated with [[The Dickies]], [[The Germs]], and other bands from that place and time. In the mid-\'80s there was a notable change in their style of music \xe2\x80\x93 taking more from their [[country music]] and [[rock and roll]]. Mike Ness admits in the DVD commentary from \'\'[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]\'\' that he may have even tried \'\'too\'\' hard on the \'\'Prison Bound\'\' album. They did eventually find their niche, and the majority of their albums from the mid-80s on to the early \'90s are considered to be punk rock or [[rockabilly]] \xe2\x80\x93 a melodic punk sound that is distinctly \xe2\x80\x93 and distinctively \xe2\x80\x93 their own.

The music was heavily influenced by [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Sex Pistols]], [[The Clash]], [[New York Dolls]], [[Johnny Thunders]], and [[The Ramones]],<ref>[http://www.socialdistortion.com/news.html The Official Social Distortion Website]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> and have influenced bands such as [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], [[Green Day]], [[Rise Against]], [[Blink-182]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[The Offspring]], and [[Thrice]].
