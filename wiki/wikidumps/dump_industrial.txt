\'\'\'Depeche Mode\'\'\' {{IPAc-en|d|\xc9\xa8|\xcb\x8c|p|\xc9\x9b|\xca\x83| |\xcb\x88|m|o\xca\x8a|d}} are an English [[Electronic music|electronic]] band formed in 1980 in [[Basildon]], Essex. The group\'s original line-up consisted of [[Dave Gahan]] (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), [[Martin Gore]] (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]] (keyboards), and [[Vince Clarke]] (keyboards, chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, \'\'[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]\'\', bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record \'\'[[A Broken Frame]]\'\', released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, [[Alan Wilder]] (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke\'s spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.

The band\'s last albums of the 1980s, \'\'[[Black Celebration]]\'\' and \'\'[[Music for the Masses]]\'\', established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band\'s concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released \'\'[[Violator (album)|Violator]]\'\', catapulting them to massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, \'\'[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]\'\', and the supporting [[Devotional Tour]] exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released \'\'[[Ultra (Depeche Mode album)|Ultra]]\'\' in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan\'s near-fatal drug abuse, Gore\'s alcoholism and Fletcher\'s depression. The release of \'\'[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]\'\' confirmed Depeche Mode\'s willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, [[Exciter Tour]] being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the [[Devotional Tour]], although the band had [[The Singles Tour|toured in 1998]] to support \'\'[[The Singles 86\xe2\x80\x9398|The Singles 86>98]]\'\' compilation album.

Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have sold over 100 million records worldwide,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |title= Depeche Mode mit Weltpremiere beim ECHO |publisher= [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |date= 3 February 2009 |accessdate= 18 August 2014 |language= de}}</ref> making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\'s best-selling bands in music history]].<ref name="Mason">{{cite journal|first= Kerri |last= Mason |title= Depeche Mode Prepares For Tour Of The Universe |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269153/depeche-mode-prepares-for-tour-of-the-universe |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher= [[Prometheus Global Media]] |date= 23 March 2009 |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}</ref> \'\'[[Q (magazine)|Q]]\'\' magazine calls Depeche Mode "the most popular electronic band the world has ever known"<ref name="Q">{{cite web|url= http://bestof.depechemode.com/ |title= Depeche Mode \xe2\x80\x93 The Best Of, Volume 1 |work= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |publisher= DepecheMode.com |accessdate= 25 May 2011}}</ref> and included the band in the list of the "50 Bands That Changed the World!".<ref name="50Bands">{{cite journal|title= Q \xe2\x80\x93 50 Bands That Changed The World! |magazine= Q |date= May 2004 |issue= 214 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World |publisher= Rocklist.net |accessdate= 31 March 2012}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and debut album (1977\xe2\x80\x931981)===
Depeche Mode\'s origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a [[The Cure]]-influenced{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}} band called No Romance In China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. Fletcher would later recall, "Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in."<ref name="P93">{{cite journal|first= Marc |last= Weidenbaum |title= Fashion Victims |magazine= Pulse! magazine |issue= 114 |date= May 1993 |pages= 48\xe2\x80\x9353}}</ref> In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an "[[Ultravox]] rip-off band", The Plan, with friends [[Robert Marlow]] and Paul Langwith.<ref>The Erasure Information Service, "[http://www.erasureinfo.com/features/interviews_03.html Interview with Robert Marlow]", Retrieved on 10 December 2007.</ref> In 1978\xe2\x80\x9379, [[Martin Gore]] played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and The Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals.<ref>{{Wayback|url= http://philburdett.com/fr_biography.cfm |title= Phil Burdett \xe2\x80\x93 Biography |date= 20110715074414 |df= y}}.

In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.

Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke heard "[[Electricity (OMD song)|Electricity]]", the debut single by [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] electronic duo [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD). He said of the song: "It sounded so different from anything I\'d heard; that really made me want to make electronic music, \'cause it was so unique."<ref>{{cite episode|title= Erasure |series= [[The O-Zone]] |network= [[BBC Two]] |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |airdate= 29 November 1995 |minutes= 8}}</ref> Along with OMD, other early influences included [[The Human League]], [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Fad Gadget]].<ref>{{cite episode|title= Synth Britannia (Part Two: Construction Time Again) |series= [[List of Britannia documentaries|Britannia]] |network= [[BBC Four]] |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |airdate= 16 October 2009 |minutes= 4 |quote= When I first started playing synthesizers it [my inspiration] would have been people like The Human League; Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, their very first album; I was a big fan of Daniel Miller\'s work, as the Silicon Teens and as The Normal; and also of Fad Gadget, who was on Mute Records.}}</ref> Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy or borrow the instruments from friends.

The band made their recording debut in 1980 on the \'\'[[Some Bizzare Album]]\'\' with the song "Photographic", which was later re-recorded for their debut album \'\'[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]\'\'.

The band made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, "most of them would tell us to fuck off. They\'d say \'leave the tape with us\' and we\'d say \'it\'s our only one\'. Then we\'d say goodbye and go somewhere else."<ref name="Giles">{{cite journal|first= Jeff |last= Giles |title= This band wants your respect \xe2\x80\x93 Depeche Mode may sell millions of albums and play to capacity crowds in huge football stadiums but these techno-pop idols still aren\'t happy |url= http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/websites/index2.php?username=depechemodefile&page=20 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= TipTopWebsite.com |date= 26 July 1990 |pages= 84\xe2\x80\x9387 |date= 11 July 1990 |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}</ref>

According to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]] offered them "money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances".<ref name="Giles"/>

While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in [[Canning Town]],<ref>Tickell, Paul (January 1982). {{Wayback|title= A Year In The Life of Depeche Mode |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/fac010182/fac010182main.htm |date= 20110808174432 |df= y}}. \'\'[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]\'\'.

Sacred DM. Retrieved 13 October 2011.</ref> The result of this verbal contract was their first single, "[[Dreaming of Me]]", recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, "[[New Life (song)|New Life]]", which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts and got them to appear on \'\'[[Top of the Pops]]\'\'. The band actually went to London by train, dragging their synthesisers all the way to the [[BBC]]\'s studios.

The band\'s next single was "[[Just Can\'t Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can\'t Get Enough]]". This relentlessly upbeat piece of synthpop became the band\'s first UK top ten hit and it remains one of their best known songs. It was also the first Depeche Mode song to get a music video and is the only one of the band\'s videos to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode\'s debut album, \'\'Speak & Spell\'\', was released in October 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts. Critical reviews were mixed; \'\'[[Melody Maker]]\'\' described it as a "great album... one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can\'t get enough",<ref>Colbert, Paul (31 October 1981). {{Wayback|title= Talking Hook Lines |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel311081/mel311081main.htm |date= 20110724052535 |df= y}}. \'\'[[Melody Maker]]\'\'.

===Clarke departs, Wilder joins (1981\xe2\x80\x931982)===
During the touring and promotion for \'\'Speak & Spell\'\', Clarke privately began to voice his discomfort at the direction the band were taking. He later expressed his dissatisfaction, saying "there was never enough time to do anything. Not with all the interviews and photo sessions".<ref>Ellen, Mark (February 1982). {{Wayback|url= http://www.tuug.utu.fi/~jaakko/dm/smash4.txt |title= A Clean Break |date= 20140204023346 |df= y}}. \'\'[[Smash Hits]]\'\'. Retrieved 12 October 2012.</ref> In November 1981, Clarke publicly announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=103}} It also was claimed that Clarke was sick of touring, which Gahan said years later was "bullshit to be quite honest".<ref name="Giles"/> Gahan went on to say he "suddenly lost interest in it and he started getting letters from fans asking what kind of socks he wore".<ref name="Giles"/>

Soon afterwards, Clarke joined up with blues singer [[Alison Moyet]] to form [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] (Yaz in the US) and later, the duo [[Erasure]] with [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]]. Initial talk of Clarke\'s continuing to write material for the group ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]", but they declined.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=107}} Clarke, however, denied in an interview that such an offer ever took place saying, "I don\'t know where that came from. That\'s not true."<ref>{{cite journal|first= Stefan |last= Reinke |first2= Kerstin |last2= Goh |url= http://www.derwesten.de/kultur/musik/erasure-im-soundcheck-id6079325.html?doply=true |title= Erasure im Soundcheck |language= de |newspaper= [[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date= 16 November 2011 |accessdate= 19 October 2013}}</ref> The song went on to become a UK Top 3 hit for Yazoo. Gore, who had written "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and the instrumental "Big Muff" for \'\'Speak & Spell\'\', was forced to become the band\'s new songwriter.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=125}}

In late 1981, the band placed an anonymous ad in \'\'Melody Maker\'\' looking for another musician; it said "Name band, synthesise, must be under twenty-one."<ref name="D93"/> Alan Wilder, a keyboardist from West London, responded and, after two auditions and despite being 22 years old, he was hired in early 1982, initially on a trial basis as a touring member.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=121}} Wilder would later be called the "Musical Director" of the band, responsible for the band\'s sound until his departure in 1995.<ref name="P93"/> As producer Flood would later say, "[Alan] is sort of the craftsman, Martin\'s the idea man and [Dave] is the attitude."<ref name="P93"/>

In January 1982, the band released "[[See You (song)|See You]]", their first single without Clarke, which managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching number six.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=113}} The tour that followed the release of the single saw the band playing their first shows in North America. Two more singles, "[[The Meaning of Love]]", and "[[Leave in Silence]]", were released ahead of the band\'s second studio album. Depeche Mode began work on their second album in July 1982. Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he was not needed for the recording of the album, as the band wanted to prove that they could succeed without Vince Clarke.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=134}} \'\'[[A Broken Frame]]\'\' was released that September and the following month the band set off on their second [[Broken Frame Tour|tour]] of 1982. A non-album single, "[[Get the Balance Right!]]", was released in January 1983, and was the first Depeche Mode track to be recorded with Wilder.{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=58}}

===\'\'Construction Time Again\'\' (1983)===
For their third LP \'\'[[Construction Time Again]]\'\', Depeche Mode worked with producer [[Gareth Jones (music producer)|Gareth Jones]], at [[John Foxx]]\'s Garden Studios and at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studios]] in West Berlin (where much of [[David Bowie]]\'s [[Berlin Trilogy|trilogy]] of seminal electronic albums featuring [[Brian Eno]] had been produced). The album saw a dramatic shift in the group\'s sound, due in part to Wilder\'s introduction of the [[Synclavier]] and [[E-mu Emulator]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]].<ref>{{Wayback|title= Editorials: The Singles 81\xe2\x80\x9385 |url= http://www.recoil.co.uk/editorials/8185/single_04.html |date= 20120307073551 |df= y}}. Recoil.co.uk. Retrieved 16 October 2010.</ref> By sampling the noises of everyday objects, the band created an eclectic, [[Industrial music|industrial]]-influenced sound, with similarities to groups such as the [[Art of Noise]] and [[Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten]], the latter having subsequently released work on the Mute label as well.<ref>Benne (3 May 2005). {{Wayback|url= http://www.muna.de/Single.853.0.html?&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=84&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=854&cHash=c5c23fb615 |title= Inga Humpe \xe2\x80\x93 Mit Depeche Mode in einer 2raumwohnung |date= 20091029130845 |df= y}} (in German).

Along with the music, Gore\'s songwriting was also rapidly evolving, focusing increasingly on political and social issues. A good example of the new sound was on the first single from the album "[[Everything Counts]]", a commentary on the perceived greed of multinational corporations.<ref>Moore, X.  (17 September 1983). {{Wayback|title= Red Rockers Over the Emerald Isle |url= http://sacreddm.net/1980s/nme170983/nme170983main.htm |date= 20110826140804 |df= y}}. \'\'[[NME]]\'\'. Sacred DM.

"Everything Counts" got to number six in the UK, also reaching the top 30 in Ireland, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden and West Germany. Wilder also contributed two songs to the album, "The Landscape Is Changing" and "Two Minute Warning". In September 1983, to promote \'\'Construction Time Again\'\' the band launched [[Construction Time Again Tour]], a concert tour all over Europe.

===\'\'Some Great Reward\'\' (1984) and increasing international success===
In their early years, Depeche Mode had only really attained success in Europe and Australia. However this changed in March 1984 when they released the single "[[People Are People]]". The song became a big hit, reaching No. 2 in Ireland and Poland, No. 4 in UK and Switzerland and No. 1 in West Germany \xe2\x80\x94 the first time a DM single topped a country\'s singles chart \xe2\x80\x94 where it was used as the theme to West German TV\'s coverage of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=82}} But, beyond this European success, the song also reached No. 13 on the US charts in mid-1985, which was the first appearance of a DM single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] (this song was a Top 20 hit in Canada at the same period too). "People Are People" has since become an anthem for the LGBT community and was regularly played at gay establishments and [[gay pride]] festivals in the late 1980s.<ref>Voss, B. (6 May 2009). {{Wayback|url= http://www.davidatlanta.com/2009/5-6/cover/coverstory/2686.cfm |title= Masters of \'The Universe\' |date= 20090609225243 |df= y}}. \'\'[[David Atlanta]]\'\'.

It was the tour in America that year where the band noticed things were changing. They were, according to Gore, "shocked by the way the fans were turning up in droves at the concerts".<ref name="Giles"/> He said that although the concerts were selling well, they were still struggling to sell records.<ref name="Giles"/>

In September 1984, \'\'[[Some Great Reward]]\'\' was released. \'\'Melody Maker\'\' claimed that the album made one "sit up and take notice of what is happening here, right under your nose."<ref>McIlheney, Barry (29 September 1984). {{Wayback|title= Greatness and Perfection |url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel290984/mel290984main.htm |date= 20090104140145 |df= y}}. \'\'Melody Maker\'\'. Sacred DM. Retrieved 13 October 2011.</ref> In contrast to the political and environmental subjects addressed on the previous album, the songs on \'\'Some Great Reward\'\' were mostly concerned with more personal themes such as sexual politics ("[[Master and Servant]]"), adulterous relationships ("Lie to Me"), and arbitrary divine justice ("[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Blasphemous Rumours]]"). Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad ("[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Somebody]]") \xe2\x80\x94 such songs would become a feature of all following albums. "Somebody" was released as a double a-side with "Blasphemous Rumours" and was the first single with Gore on lead vocals. \'\'Some Great Reward\'\' was the first Depeche Mode album to enter the US album charts, and it made the Top 10 in several European countries.

\'\'[[The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg]]\'\' was the band\'s first video release. It is an almost complete film of a concert from their 1984 [[Some Great Reward Tour]], in [[Hamburg]], Germany. In July 1985, the band played their first-ever concerts behind the [[Iron Curtain]], in [[Budapest]] and [[Warsaw]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=95}} In October 1985, [[Mute Records]] released a compilation, \'\'[[The Singles 81\xe2\x86\x9285]]\'\' (\'\'[[Catching Up with Depeche Mode]]\'\' in the US), which included the two non-album hit-singles "[[Shake the Disease]]" and "[[It\'s Called a Heart]]".

During this period, in some circles, the band became associated with the [[goth subculture]], which had begun in Britain in the early-1980s, and was now slowly gaining popularity in the United States. There, the band\'s music had first gained prominence on college radio and [[modern rock]] stations such as [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] in Los Angeles, [[KQAK]] ("The Quake") in San Francisco, [[WFNX]] in Boston and [[WLIR]] on [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]], and hence they appealed primarily to an [[Alternative rock|alternative]] audience who were disenfranchised with the predominance of "soft rock and \'disco hell\'"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/athree.htm |title= Alan Wilder\'s history \xe2\x80\x93 Historical evidence Part 1

Retrieved 13 October 2011.</ref> In Germany, France and other European countries, Depeche Mode were considered teen idols and were regularly featured in European teen magazines, becoming one of the most famous synthpop bands in the mid-80\'s.

===\'\'Black Celebration\'\' (1986)===
Depeche Mode\'s musical style shifted slightly again in 1986 with the release of their fifteenth single "[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]", and its accompanying album \'\'[[Black Celebration]]\'\'. Retaining their often imaginative sampling and beginning to move away from the "industrial pop" sound that had characterised their previous two LPs, the band introduced an ominous, highly atmospheric and textured sound. Gore\'s lyrics also took on a darker tone and became even more pessimistic.

Later, the ads included a phone number one could dial to hear the song. The resulting furore helped propel the single to number 13 on the UK charts, becoming one of their biggest sellers to date; in the US, it was their first gold single and their first Top 40 hit since "People Are People", eventually becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch single in [[Warner Bros.

The [[Devotional Tour|Devotional]] world tour followed. It was documented by a concert film of the [[Devotional (video)|same name]].

Dave Gahan\'s [[heroin addiction]] was starting to affect his behaviour, causing him to become more erratic and introverted.

\'\'\'Coil\'\'\' was an English cross-genre, [[experimental music|experimental]] music group formed in 1982 by [[John Balance]]&mdash;later credited as "Jhonn Balance"&mdash;and his partner [[Peter Christopherson]], aka "Sleazy".<ref name="AbrAhAdAbrA">{{cite news | url=http://maldoror.com/artists/coil/abrahadabra1.htm | title=Coil Interview: The Price of Existence is Eternal Warfare | work=AbrAhAdAbrA | issue=1 | date=23 January 1985 | accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref> The duo worked together on a series of releases before Balance chose the name Coil, which he claimed to be inspired by the [[omnipresence]] of the [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]]\'s shape in nature. Today, Coil remains one of the most influential and best-known [[industrial music]] groups.

The group\'s first official release as Coil was a  1984 12" album titled \'\'[[How to Destroy Angels (song)|How to Destroy Angels]]\'\' released on the Belgian [[Les Disques du Cr\xc3\xa9puscule]]\'s sublabel LAYLAH Antirecords. Following the 12"s success, [[Some Bizarre Records]] produced two albums, \'\'[[Scatology (album)|Scatology]]\'\', \'\'[[Horse Rotorvator]]\'\' and Coil departed SomeBizzare Label and Produced \'\'[[Love\'s Secret Domain]]\'\', which met with little commercial success, but were praised as innovative due to their blend of industrial music and [[acid house]].<ref name="Liar Society">{{cite web

In 1985, the group began working on a series of soundtracks, amongst them music for the first \'\'[[Hellraiser]]\'\' movie based on the novel \'\'The Hellbound Heart\'\' by their acquaintance at that time, [[Clive Barker]]. The group\'s first live performance in 16 years occurred in 1999, and began a series of mini-tours that would last until 2004.<ref name="Brainwashed Live Archive">{{cite web

==Beginning (1982\xe2\x80\x931984)==
Coil was formed in 1982 and became a full-time concern in 1984, following Christopherson\'s departure from [[Psychic TV]].<ref name="AbrAhAdAbrA"/> Balance and Christopherson began working with [[John "Zos Kia" Gosling|John Gosling]] on the project [[Zos Kia]], which resulted in four live performances and the 1984 cassette tape \'\'[[Transparent (Coil album)|Transparent]]\'\'. Following Gosling\'s departure, Balance and Christopherson teamed up with [[Boyd Rice]], and under the alias \'\'Sickness of Snakes\'\', released the split four-track album, \'\'[[Nightmare Culture]]\'\', with the experimental group [[Current 93]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=93 Current 93* / Sickness Of Snakes \xe2\x80\x93 Nightmare Culture|url=http://www.discogs.com/93-Current-93-Sickness-Of-Snakes-Nightmare-Culture/release/104001|website=93 Current 93* / Sickness Of Snakes on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref>

While working on their first official release, 1984\'s 12-inch album \'\'How to Destroy Angels\'\', the group settled on the name "Coil". According to the sleeve notes, the single-track [[Gramophone record|LP]] is "ritual music for the accumulation of male sexual energy", and was produced under a variety of [[technological]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[meteorological]] conditions that was [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]]ally significant for the band members.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==\'\'Scatology\'\', \'\'Horse Rotorvator\'\', and \'\'Love\'s Secret Domain\'\' (1984\xe2\x80\x931992)==
Following the underground hit \'\'How to Destroy Angels\'\', Coil left [[L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords]] for Some Bizzare Records and produced \'\'Scatology\'\', released in 1984 as their first full-length studio album. The album was largely based on the sound of industrial music as well as the [[Post-punk]] movement. While songs such as "Restless Day", "Panic" and "Tainted Love" are representative of a mainstream style, other tracks preview what would become Coil\'s unique electronic style. The single \'\'[[Panic/Tainted Love]]\'\' became the first AIDS benefit music release, as the profits from sales of the single were donated to the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vague|first=Tom|title=Boys From The Crap Stuff|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/coil-1985-zigzag.php?site=coil08|publisher=ZigZag Magazine|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> The "Tainted Love" music video, directed by Christopherson, is in the permanent collection of the [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, U.S.<ref name="Lust\'s Dark Exit">{{cite news | url=http://www.brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/publications/coil-1991-lusts_dark_exit.php?site=coil08 | title=Lust\'s Dark Exit | work=Electric Dark Space | year=1991 |accessdate=19 April 2010}}</ref>

\'\'Horse Rotorvator\'\' followed in 1986 as the next full-length release. Although songs such as "The Anal Staircase" and "Circles of Mania" sound like evolved versions of \'\'Scatology\'\' material, the album is characterized by slower tempos, and represented a new direction for the group. The album has a darker theme than previous releases, according to Balance:

Horse Rotorvator was this vision I\'d had of this mechanical/flesh thing that ploughed up the earth and I really did have a vision of it&mdash;a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night ...

==Soundtracks and side projects (1993\xe2\x80\x931998)==
Coil separated their works into many [[side project]]s, publishing music under different names and a variety of styles. The pre-Coil aliases, Zos Kia and Sickness of Snakes, formed the foundation of a style that would evolve to characterize their initial wave of releases.

Before embarking on their second wave of side projects and pseudonyms, Coil created a soundtrack for the movie \'\'[[Hellraiser]]\'\', although they withdrew from the project when they suspected their music would not be used.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1">Dickie, Tony. "[http://brainwashed.com/coil/writings/compulsion.html Compulsion]". \'\'brainwashed.com\'\', Winter 1992. Retrieved 23 February 2007.</ref> Furthermore, Coil claimed inspiration for [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] was partly drawn from the piercing magazines that director Barker borrowed from the group.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1"/> Balance explained after the release of \'\'Stolen and Contaminated Songs\'\', in around 1992:

<blockquote>
Yeah it would have been brilliant but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have carried on, because they were changing everything and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t being very nice to us, the actual film people. They were keeping us in the dark a lot. We said we\xe2\x80\x99d had enough just at the same time they decided they wanted to use Howard Shore. They just wanted normal film music. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything too scary which is sad and ridiculous for a horror film.<ref name="Con">{{cite web|title=Coil: An interview with John Balance|author=Tony Dickie|url=http://www.compulsiononline.com/interview_coil.htm|website=Compulsion online|publisher=Compulsion|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=1992}}</ref></blockquote>

Also in 1992, Threshold House released a "Remixes And Re-Recordings" version of \'\'How to Destroy Angels\'\'. [[Nurse with Wound]]\'s [[Steven Stapleton]] contributed a remix of the song, "How To Destroy Angels II".<ref>{{cite web|title=Coil \xe2\x80\x93 How To Destroy Angels (Remixes And Re-Recordings)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Coil-How-To-Destroy-Angels-Remixes-And-Re-Recordings/release/59384|website=Coil at Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=2014}}</ref>

Beginning in 1993, Coil contributed music to two of [[Derek Jarman]]\'s films, \'\'[[Blue (1993 film)|Blue]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Angelic Conversation (film)|The Angelic Conversation]]\'\'. In addition, they recorded soundtracks for the documentary \'\'[[Gay Man\'s Guide to Safer Sex]]\'\' as well as \'\'Sarah Dales Sensuous Massage\'\', though both remain unreleased.<ref name="Compulsion, Number 1">{{cite news | url=http://brainwashed.com/coil/writings/compulsion.html | author = Dickie, Tony | title=Compulsion | work=Compulsion | date=Winter 1992 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

Much like the pre-Coil aliases, Coil\'s series of side projects represented a diverse basis from which the group evolved a different style of sound. While \'\'[[Nasa Arab]]\'\'&mdash;credited to the group\'s project "The Eskaton"&mdash;was Coil\'s farewell to the acid house genre, the following projects, [[Born Again Pagans|ELpH]], [[A Thousand Lights in a Darkened Room|Black Light District]], and [[Time Machines]], were all based heavily on experimentation with [[Drone music|drone]], an ingredient that would define Coil\'s following work. These releases also launched the start of Coil\'s new label [[Eskaton]].

\'\'Transparent\'\' was reissued in CD format in 1997 on Threshold House.<ref>{{cite web|title=Threshold House|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/3193-Threshold-House|website=Threshold House on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=2015}}</ref> A disc and booklet were packaged in a "thick" slipcase, which was released

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JohnBalanceAndPeterChristophersonRoughtrade6.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Balance and Christopherson later in the Coil career.]] -->
After the wave of experimental side projects, Coil\'s sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations \'\'[[Unnatural History II]]\'\', \'\'[[Windowpane & The Snow]]\'\' and \'\'[[Unnatural History III]]\'\'. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed to coincide with the [[equinox]] and [[solstice]]s of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation.<ref name="Moons Milk (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

The second single, \'\'[[Summer Solstice: Bee Stings]]\'\', also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[noise music|noise]] song "A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)", which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson\'s who had committed suicide earlier that year.<ref name="Coil News 1998">{{cite web

The fourth single, \'\'[[Winter Solstice: North (album)|Winter Solstice: North]]\'\', also includes a track sung by McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project [[Rosa Mundi (group)|Rosa Mundi]]. The series would later be re-released as the double-CD set, \'\'[[Moon\'s Milk (In Four Phases)]]\'\'.

\'\'[[Astral Disaster]]\'\' was created with the assistance from new band member [[Thighpaulsandra]], and was released in January 1999 via [[Sun Dial]] member Gary Ramon\'s label, Prescription.<ref name="Astral Disaster (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

\'\'[[Queens Of The Circulating Library]]\'\' followed in April 2000, with production credit given to Thighpaulsandra. The single-track, full-length drone album is the only Coil release made without the assistance of Christopherson. \'\'[[Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2]]\'\' followed in September 2000, and Coil began to perform live more intensively, a period that also included writing the music for \'\'[[Black Antlers]]\'\' in between a series of mini-tours.<ref name="Black Antlers (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

Coil finally released \'\'Black Antlers\'\' in June 2004.

In contrast to many of their earlier releases, Coil\'s later material is characterized by a slower sound which relies more on drone than acid house. This change in sound was reflected in their live performances, as songs like "Ostia" and "Slur" were slowed down from their original pace, as well as re-recordings of "Teenage Lightning" and "Amethyst Deceivers" that were later released on \'\'The Ape Of Naples\'\'.<ref name="The Ape Of Naples (Brainwashed.com)">{{cite web

==Coil Live==

{{main|Coil Live}}
Coil\'s live incarnation is associated with a distinct legacy. The first live shows took place in 1983, but after only four performances, 15 years would pass before they would play live again.<ref name="Brainwashed Live Archive"/>

On 14 December 1999, Coil performed \'\'[[elph.zw\xc3\xb6lf]]\'\' at [[Volksbuehne]] in Berlin. Although the performance lasted just under 18 minutes, it marked the beginning of a new era of live performances. Coil would go on to perform close to 50 additional concerts, with varied [[set list]]s as well as performers.

Coil performed twice at the Royal Festival Hall in 2000. The first concert was in April, as part of a weekend curated by Julian Cope, when they first performed as the full band line-up&nbsp;&ndash; and wearing the "fluffy suits" that would become a staple of live performances for the first time&nbsp;&ndash; performing \'\'Time Machines\'\'. They performed again in September, sharing a bill with Jim Thirlwell (as [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]]) on that occasion. Both performances were full sets.

Coil\'s performances were surrealistic visually and audibly. The signature fluffy suits, an idea inspired by [[Sun Ra]], played a foremost role at the live shows.<ref name="Rattlebag Radio RTE interview">{{cite interview |last= |first= |subject=Coil |subjectlink= |last2= |first2= |subject2= |subjectlink2= |last3= |first3= |subject3= |subjectlink3= |last4= |subject4= |interviewer=Dungan, Myles. |title=Rattlebag |publisher=[[RT\xc3\x89 Radio 1]] |type= |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20061208114019/http://brainwashed.com/common/sounds/mp3/coil-interview-rattlebag_dublin-20041022.mp3 |format= |program= |callsign= |city=Dublin, Ireland |date=22 October 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2009}}</ref> The suits would later be used as album covers for the release \'\'[[Live One (Coil album)|Live One]]\'\', while other costumes appear on the covers of \'\'[[Live Two]]\'\' and \'\'[[Live Three]]\'\'\xe2\x80\x94straitjacket and mirror-chested hooded jumpsuit, respectively. Video screens projected footage and animations created by Christopherson, while fog machines created an eerie atmosphere. Balance would often screech and howl during performances, which would add to the effect.

The band\'s performance at the 2003 [[All Tomorrow\'s Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow\'s Parties]] festival was released as \'\'[[...And The Ambulance Died In His Arms]]\'\'.

Balance died on 13 November 2004, after he fell from a second-floor landing in his home.

They decided that time was needed to mourn Balance\'s passing, recuperate from the loss, and assess the quality of the unreleased work. It was also decided that existing video, audio and other works that were in various states of completion at the time of Balance\'s death would eventually be released under the name Coil, and all other planned appearances and releases would be canceled.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Several tribute albums were released in memory of Balance including the compilations \'\'Full Cold Moon\'\', \'\'The Loneliest Link In A Very Strange Chain\'\' (which had been started before Balance passed and was originally due to be called "Never", but switched titles after the tragic event), \'\'[[Rotorelief|Coilectif: In memory ov John Balance and homage to Coil]]\'\', \'\'[[...It Just Is]]\'\' and \'\'[[X-Rated: The Dark Files]]\'\'. The album \'\'[[How He Loved The Moon (Moonsongs For Jhonn Balance)]]\'\' by Balance collaborator [[David Tibet]] was released under his group Current 93. A [[Live December 2004 A Souvenir Of Camber Sands|live album]] by Throbbing Gristle was also dedicated to Balance. On 23 December 2005, a memorial concert was held for Balance, and performers included Christopherson\'s new solo effort [[The Threshold HouseBoy\'s Choir]], [[Alec Empire]] and [[CoH (musician)|CoH]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The final studio album, \'\'The Ape of Naples\'\', was released on 2 December 2005. In August 2006, the rare CD-R releases, \'\'[[The Remote Viewer]]\'\' and \'\'Black Antlers\'\', were "sympathetically remastered" and expanded into two disc versions, which included new and recently remixed material. A comprehensive 16-DVD boxset, titled \'\'[[Colour Sound Oblivion]]\'\', was released in July 2010. A "Patron Edition" was pre-orderable in November 2009 and sold out in three hours.

We don\'t follow any particular religious dogma. In fact, quite the reverse, we tend to discourage the following of dogmas, or false prophets, as it were.

===Influence===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:2000June17CoilWithStockhausenAtSonar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Coil with [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] at the Sonar festival on 17 June 2000.]] -->
Although Coil expressed interest in many musical groups, they rarely, if ever, claimed to be influenced by them. Coil explicitly stated the influence of such non-musical sources as [[William Burroughs]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Bryon Gysin]] and [[Austin Spare]].<ref name="Radio Inferno, Dutch Radio4 Supplement"/> Furthermore, the group were friends with Burroughs and owned some of Spare\'s original artwork.<ref name="Mutek"/>

Balance encouraged fans to trade, discuss and discover new and different forms of music, stressing the importance of variety. Music that Coil expressed interest in is diverse and wide-ranging, from [[musique concr\xc3\xa8te]] to [[folk music]] to [[hardcore punk]] to [[european classical music|classical]]. Among the musicians Coil expressed interest in were early electronic, experimental and minimalistic artists: [[Harry Partch]], [[La Monte Young]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] (once referred to by Balance as "an honorary member of Coil"), [[Alvin Lucier]], and [[Arvo P\xc3\xa4rt]].<ref name="The Complete Interview">{{Cite news

Coil\'s influence on electronic music has become more evident since the death of Balance, with electronic musicians from all over the world collaborating on a series of tribute albums. Some notable artists who appear on these albums are [[Alec Empire]], [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] and [[K.K. Null]] (see \'\'[[...It Just Is]]\'\'). [[Nine Inch Nails]] front-man [[Trent Reznor]] also expressed the significant influence that the group had on his work in February 2014:<ref>{{cite web

<blockquote>
[Coil\'s] \'Tainted Love\' video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it\'s not immediately obvious: Horse Rotorvator was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.<ref name="Harry">{{cite web|title=Trent Reznor On Coil & Nine Inch Nails, Plus Recoiled Review|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14600-trent-reznor-interview-coil-nine-inch-nails|work=The Quietus|publisher=The Quietus|accessdate=28 February 2014|author=Harry Sword|date=27 February 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

The track "At The Heart Of It All" (found on \'\'Scatology\'\') later became the name of an [[Aphex Twin]] track on the Nine Inch Nails remix album \'\'[[Further Down the Spiral]]\'\'; Coil also provided remixes for \'\'Further Down the Spiral\'\'. Furthermore, in 2010, Reznor, [[Mariqueen Maandig]] and [[Atticus Ross]] started a new band called [[How to Destroy Angels (band)|How To Destroy Angels]]\xe2\x80\x94named after the Coil song\xe2\x80\x94which received Christopherson\'s blessing after Reznor made contact with him.<ref name="Harry" />

\'\'\'Controlled Bleeding\'\'\' is a prolific [[Experimental music|experimental]] music group based in [[Massapequa, New York]]. The group was founded by Paul Lemos, the group\'s only consistent member. Most of Controlled Bleeding\'s released recordings feature two main collaborators, Chris Moriarty and vocalist Joe Papa, who both died in the late 2000s.

Since their first full-length release in 1983, Controlled Bleeding have released over 30 albums spanning several different genres, many of which were released on notable independent labels. Their cross-genre approach combined with the out-of-print status of many of the group\'s releases is reminiscent of the work of other experimental and cross-genre groups of the 80s and 90s such as [[Coil (band)|Coil]] and [[Swans (band)|Swans]].

== Recorded output ==

Controlled Bleeding have been highly prolific since 1983, putting out more than 30 full-length releases on labels such as Dossier, Wax Trax!, Subterranean, Soleilmoon, and Roadrunner.<ref name="cbdiscography">{{cite web |url=http://www.belmarnj.com/cb/cbdisco.htm |title=Controlled Bleeding Discography |first=John |last=Dietrich |date=2002-01-15}}</ref> Due to the broad musical interests of the main collaborators, as well as the influence of the band\'s relationships with genre-focused labels like [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]] and [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]], Controlled Bleeding\'s total recorded output spans many different genres including [[noise (music)|harsh noise]], [[dub (music)|dub]], [[progressive rock]], [[industrial dance]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[gothic rock|gothic]], [[Dark Wave|darkwave]], [[classical music|classical]], [[religious music|sacred music]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[free jazz]] improvisation, and \'\'[[musique concr\xc3\xa8te]]\'\'. Through the 80s and 90s, the group jumped from genre to genre; they would often release two or more full-length albums of music in the same year featuring radically different musical styles.<ref>http://antocularismagazine.blogspot.com/2006/07/controlled-bleeding.html</ref>

Controlled Bleeding\'s music is difficult to categorize, not only because of the experimental and varied nature of their work, but also because of the confusing ways in which their music has been released over the years. Some of the band\'s releases are made of remixed earlier material from multiple other releases, sometimes with new or missing song titles. The band\'s full-length releases occasionally contain material that jumps abruptly between multiple disparate genres; most strikingly, tracks of harsh noise appear on releases that are otherwise not noise-based. Additionally, in some cases, later CD issues of their original LPs are renamed, heavily remixed, or feature different tracks altogether,<ref name="cbdiscography"/> due to the group\'s desire to "improve" earlier material.<ref>http://media.hyperreal.org/zines/est/intervs/pl_final.html</ref>

== Early trio: 1978\xe2\x80\x931980 ==

Controlled Bleeding was originally formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] around 1978 by Paul Lemos, Jack Salerno and Dave Southerland. Later, returning to [[Massapequa, New York]], Lemos formed a group with old school friends, Gary Pecorino (organ) and Tony Meola (drums), and released a 7" EP called \'\'Wall of China Love Letter\'\' in 1980. This early incarnation played a kind of progressive-influenced art rock.

Music from these early years was issued on several of Controlled Bleeding\'s later releases. An LP called \'\'Lung Ties\'\' which documented some of this trio\'s live and studio recordings was released on Eksakt Records in 1985 under the band name "Body Sink".<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Body-Sink-Lung-Ties/release/1070390</ref> The 1994 reissue of \'\'Songs from the Ashes\'\' includes three bonus tracks of live recordings of the Lemos/Pecorino/Meola trio playing at the New York City club [[CBGB]]. In 2008, Controlled Bleeding released \'\'Before the Quiet\'\', which consists of many of the \'\'Lung Ties\'\' LP tracks along with more 1978\xe2\x80\x931981 archive material. Some of this material is also included on the 4-LP box set \'\'Songs from a Sewer of Dreams\'\', released in 2007.<ref>http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/control.html#songs2</ref><ref>http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/control.html#before</ref>

== Experimental phase: 1983\xe2\x80\x931988 ==

By 1982 or 1983, Pecorino and Meola had left the group, and were replaced by two new musical collaborators: Joe Papa, a "300-pound scat-singing eccentric",<ref>http://www.controlledbleeding.com/about.php</ref> and Chris Moriarty, a neighbor of Paul who originally filled in on drums. Paul Lemos met Joe Papa after putting an ad in a local music paper in search of a singer.<ref>http://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/paul-lemos/</ref> From late 1983 until Moriarty\'s departure in 1994, all Controlled Bleeding releases featured at least Papa or Moriarty, and usually both.

The next four years of Controlled Bleeding\'s output strayed from the previous trio\'s art rock leanings into more experimental areas. During 1983 and 1984, the band released a series of live-to-two-track cassettes via labels like [[Inner-X-Musick]], Broken Flag, and Ladd-Frith which featured layered, harsh [[Noise (music)|industrial noise]], sometimes mixed with guitar and Joe Papa\'s vocal work. In February 1985,<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Controlled-Bleeding-Knees-And-Bones/release/137764</ref> the band\'s first full-length LP, \'\'Knees and Bones\'\', was released by Hans Fahlberg on his Sweden-based record label Psychout Productions, featuring a particularly harsh wall of sound similar to the work of other American and [[Japanoise|Japanese]] [[Noise (music)|harsh noise]] artists.

Their second LP, \'\'Body Samples\'\', was completed in April 1985 and released on Germany\'s Dossier Records. Although most of the tracks on the album featured harsh sounds similar to their first LP, \'\'Body Samples\'\' also had more layered, textural moments, including melodic synthesizer-based ambience and primal drumming. According to the liner notes in the 1990 CD reissue of \'\'Body Samples\'\', the layered approach on some tracks was due to the group\'s acquisition of a four-track reel-to-reel recorder, which gave the band more freedom than their previous live-to-cassette recording methods.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Controlled-Bleeding-Body-Samples/release/102264</ref> Also during 1985, the band released \'\'Feet Hacked Rails\'\' on Dossier under the pseudonym "The Art Barbeque", which strayed further from noise into more melodic and rhythmic territory; some of the material from \'\'Feet Hacked Rails\'\' appears on the 1990 CD reissue of \'\'Body Samples\'\', along with some tracks from the earlier cassette-only release \'\'Shitslipper\'\'.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Art-Barbeque-Feet-Hacked-Rails/release/431427</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, Controlled Bleeding released five more full-length LPs: \'\'Curd\'\' (1986, Dossier), \'\'Headcrack\'\' (1986, Sterile Records), \'\'Between Tides\'\' (1986, Multimood), \'\'Core\'\' (1987, Subterranean), and \'\'Songs from the Drain\'\' (1987, Dossier). Paul Lemos has stated that these releases contain music made by the band throughout 1984\xe2\x80\x931987, so an exact chronology of the material made during this time period is not known.<ref name="gsinterview">http://www.prongs.org/godsend/cbleeding89.html</ref> Beginning with \'\'Curd\'\', the band left the distortion-heavy noise of their previous releases behind in favor of a more varied experimental approach. \'\'Core\'\' is notable as the first Controlled Bleeding vinyl LP to be released by a label based in the United States, although some of the group\'s early cassettes and compilations were released stateside a few years earlier.

\'\'Headcrack\'\' is the first record released by Controlled Bleeding that demonstrates the [[classical music|classical]]/[[medieval music|medieval]]/[[sacred music]] influences which would reappear throughout their discography, and the album features Joe Papa\'s wordless vocals more prominently than any previous release. A similar sound to \'\'Headcrack\'\' was also featured on \'\'Music for Stolen Icons\'\', a 12" EP released by the band on Sub Rosa in 1986 under the name "Paul Lemos & Joe Papa". 

In 1988 and 1989, the band released two LPs on the Belgian label [[Sub Rosa (label)|Sub Rosa]], \'\'Music from the Scourging Ground\'\' (1988) and \'\'Music for Gilded Chambers\'\' (1989). These LPs continued the band\'s exploration of medieval and sacred music and mixed it with soundtrack-like ambient passages. Also, most notably, these were the first two Controlled Bleeding albums to feature songs with lyrics. These two releases were remixed and combined for the US CD-only release \'\'Songs from the Ashes\'\' (C\'est La Mort, 1990).

=== Availability on CD ===

Some of the band\'s first nine LPs were later issued on CD in various forms. Some of the original tracks were not included in the CD versions, and some material was remixed and/or edited.

== Industrial dance and metal phase (1989\xe2\x80\x931993) ==
=== Industrial dance ===

From 1988 to 1990, Controlled Bleeding made another strong stylistic shift and recorded several releases of [[Heavy metal music|metal]]-tinged [[Electronic body music|industrial dance music]] which were released on [[Wax Trax! Records]]. Thanks to the label\'s large advertising budget<ref name="gsinterview"/> and a favorable critical response, this material provided the highest record sales of the band\'s career thus far, and gave the band a worldwide reputation as an industrial dance act.<ref name="belmarnj.com">http://www.belmarnj.com/cb/cbinterview.htm</ref> The first EP in this style, \'\'Songs from the Grinding Wall\'\' (1989), was heavily promoted by the label, and was followed by a full-length release, \'\'Trudge\'\' (1989), which the label promoted further by issuing 12" singles for the album tracks "The Fodder Song" and "Words (of the Dying)".

In addition to a heavier use of MIDI sequencing and sampling, these were the first Controlled Bleeding recordings to prominently feature Chris Moriarty\'s vocals, and Moriarty and Lemos shared lead vocal duties throughout. They also used lyrics a lot more often, signaling a departure from the often wordless vocals provided by Joe Papa on previous releases. Lemos and Moriarty later released a side project EP, \'\'Joined at the Head\'\' (1990, Wax Trax!), which blended \'\'Trudge\'\' sounds with more [[Heavy metal music|metal]] and [[thrash metal|thrash]] influences. These Wax Trax! releases were later reissued on the CD compilation \'\'Buried Blessings\'\' (1993, Cleopatra), although "Healing Time" and "Christ Said" from \'\'Trudge\'\' were omitted.

Two of the J.A.T.H. tracks would later appear on their next industrial dance album \'\'Penetration\'\' (1992, Third Mind Records), which introduced a slight [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influence along with updated electronic rhythms.

=== Skin Chamber ===

Between \'\'Trudge\'\' and \'\'Penetration\'\', Lemos and Moriarty recorded a collection of grindcore demos in their home studio under the band name "Fat Hacker" and sent them to the A&R at [[Roadrunner Records]], not expecting much of a response.<ref name="youtube.com">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUe8Jl-t9Q</ref> To their surprise, the label showed interest, and the duo spent several months refining their metal experiments into an album, now working under the name [[Skin Chamber]]. The resulting album, \'\'Wound\'\' (1991), was influenced heavily by industrial metal bands such as Swans and Godflesh, and was relatively commercially successful.<ref name="belmarnj.com"/> Skin Chamber\'s second album, \'\'Trial\'\' (1993, Roadrunner), was recorded with a larger budget, and although it displayed a wider variety of influences and sonic textures as well as an inspired vocal appearance by Joe Papa, it was not received as favorably by fans or critics.<ref name="youtube.com"/>

=== Compilations and other releases ===

In addition to the five releases mentioned above, Controlled Bleeding found the time to release even more music during this five-year period. In 1990, compilations of songs from their career thus far were released in Italy (\'\'Gag\'\', Material Sonori Records) and the United States (\'\'Hog Floor (A Fractured View)\'\', Subterranean). The band also issued the aforementioned reworked CD versions of \'\'Body Samples\'\' and \'\'Curd\'\' during this time.

Two harsh noise releases would also appear during this time; an archival release of outtakes from the 1983 \'\'Knees and Bones\'\' recording sessions called \'\'Phlegm Bag Spattered\'\' <ref>This was accidentally misspelled "Plegm Bag Spattered" on the release.</ref> (1990, Dark Vinyl), and a mixed release of new and archival noise recordings on Japan\'s Vanilla Records called \'\'Bladder Bags and Interludes\'\' (1992).

In 1989, the first solo album by Paul Lemos, \'\'Sludge\'\' (1989, Dossier) was released, displaying strong industrial dance influences on side A and dark ambient/soundtrack work on side B. Lemos later released another solo album, \'\'Phlegm Dive\'\' (1992, Dossier) which was composed largely of demo and alternate versions of previously released tracks.

Although the industrial dance and metal releases were mainly a collaboration between Paul Lemos and Chris Moriarty, Lemos and Joe Papa split off to write and record two new albums of ambient and medieval-influenced music during this same time period on two new record labels: \'\'Golgotha\'\' (1991, Staalplaat) and \'\'Music for Stolen Icons II\'\' (1993, Artware, released as "Paul Lemos & Joe Papa"). One track from \'\'Golgotha\'\', "Awakened Beneath the Ground", would also appear at the end of \'\'Penetration\'\'.

== Dark ambient and dub: 1994\xe2\x80\x931997  ==

After the cooler-than-expected reception of the second Skin Chamber album, Paul Lemos became disenchanted with industrial dance and metal, and perhaps as a result, his collaborations with Chris Moriarty slowed considerably at this time.<ref name="chaindlk.com">http://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/Controlled-Bleeding/</ref> The next Controlled Bleeding album, \'\'The Drowning\'\' (1994, Dark Vinyl) clearly signalled Lemos\'s intent to return to more experimental waters: the 40-second industrial dance track that begins the album makes a sudden, unexpected transition to eight minutes of some of the harshest noise sounds that Controlled Bleeding ever recorded. The rest of the album was filled with dark ambience, noise, and cavernous rhythms, unaccompanied by lyrics and using very few vocal sounds. 

\'\'The Drowning\'\' would be the last time in Controlled Bleeding\'s catalog that Moriarty would be listed as a band member on a collection of new music. He went on to release a solo album, \'\'Grip Life\'\', the next year under the band name "Body Clock", a mixed collection of musical styles which featured guest appearances by Lemos on guitar and Chris\'s friend Trang on vocals.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Body-Clock-Grip-Life/release/336790</ref>

Later in 1994, the band released two more reissues of earlier albums. \'\'Songs from the Vault\'\', released on Dark Vinyl Records, was a collection of remixed tracks from \'\'Headcrack\'\' and \'\'Music for Stolen Icons I\'\'. The second reissue, \'\'Songs from the Drain\'\' (Dossier), began with three newly recorded tracks, the first of which was a demonstration of a brand new sound for Controlled Bleeding: [[dub music]]. Lemos and Papa would focus and refine their brand of dub on their next full-length, \'\'Dub Songs from a Shallow Grave\'\' (1995, Dossier), which was composed almost completely of electronic dub songs with Papa on vocals.

The next official album by the band was a two-CD set on Hypnotic records called \'\'Inanition\'\'. The first disc was entirely new music, and was composed of two new dub tracks sandwiched between two very long pieces of ambient music, in a style and pacing reminiscent of many of [[Bill Laswell]]\'s ambient dub projects. Trang, who was a guest on Moriarty\'s solo album, also made her first appearance with the group here on vocals. The second disc was a compilation of ambient tracks from their entire career, dating as far back as 1986\'s \'\'Curd\'\'. 

Also in 1996, Lemos and Papa released \'\'Songs from the Shadows\'\' on Death Factory/Cold Meat Industries under the pseudonym "In Blind Embrace", which was a more gothic-sounding album that harkened back to the songs featured on \'\'Songs from the Ashes\'\'; appropriately, the album featured a guest appearance by vocalist [[Rozz Williams]]. This album was later re-released in 2008 on MVD Audio under the name "Controlled Bleeding - \'\'In Blind Embrace\'\'".

The last two albums of this period were released in 1997. \'\'Gilded Shadows\'\' (Hypnotic) was another full-length electronic dub effort, once again featuring both Joe Papa and Trang on vocals. Their final album of this period, \'\'The Poisoner\'\' (Soleilmoon), consisted of two long dark ambient tracks, was the most soundtrack-like of any Controlled Bleeding release and featured San Diego experimental composer Guy Lohnes on processed guitar, as well as Trang on vocals. These two albums, although falling into different genres, were both carefully recorded over a longer period of time than most previous albums by the group, and were very stylistically consistent; as such, they received some of the best reviews of Controlled Bleeding\'s career.<ref>http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/control.html#poisoner</ref>

== Inactive: 1997\xe2\x80\x932002 ==

After the release of \'\'Gilded Shadows\'\' and \'\'The Poisoner\'\' in 1997, Lemos took a break from making music, and put Controlled Bleeding on hold. According to later interviews, this break was due to a lack of musical inspiration that set in after working so hard on the last two releases.<ref name="chaindlk.com"/> 

In 1999, a two-CD "best-of" collection was released on Cleopatra Records called \'\'Rest in Peace: The Best of Controlled Bleeding\'\'. The first disc, "Hard Rhythms and Noise", was a retrospective of the band\'s industrial dance, metal, and noise periods, and the second disc, "Dark Voices and Instrumentals", focused on the band\'s sacred music, gothic, and dark ambient work. Furthermore, the liner notes announced that Controlled Bleeding was officially deactivated as a musical project.<ref>http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/control.html#can</ref>

The next year, a compilation of dub music from \'\'Dub Songs from a Shallow Grave\'\', \'\'Inanition\'\', and \'\'Gilded Shadows\'\' called \'\'Our Journey\'s End\'\' was released on Material Sonori. This release also included a cover of "The Talking Drum" by King Crimson, which also appeared on the \'\'Rest in Peace\'\' compilation, and featured Chris Moriarty on drum programming.<ref name="myspace.com">http://www.myspace.com/controlledbleeding/blog/371058577</ref> Although this release was a compilation of previously released tracks, no song titles were included, and the liner notes did not state that the material was previously released.<ref>http://www.ssmt-reviews.com/artist/control.html#our</ref> Slightly surprisingly, this release was credited to "The Controlled Bleeding", and was the first time that "The" appeared before the band name on any release.

== Reactivation: 2002\xe2\x80\x932009 ==

After a five-year hiatus, Controlled Bleeding released an album of new music entitled \'\'Can You Smell the Rain Between\'\' (2002, Tone Casualties), once again using the name "The Controlled Bleeding". Straying again from the cohesion of their 1997 releases, Lemos and Papa included tracks of ambient music, dub, and free jazz-inspired live improvisation.<ref name="chaindlk.com"/> The album includes remixes of material from \'\'The Poisoner\'\' featuring guitarist Guy Lohnes, and [[Tatsuya Yoshida]] of [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] makes a guest appearance on drums on the track "Felch Space Scan". The release includes a cover of "[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]" by [[Brian Eno]].

In early 2003, the trio of Lemos, Papa, and Yoshida released a full-length [[free jazz]]-inspired effort under the project name Breast Fed Yak called \'\'Get Your Greasy Head Off the Sham\'\'. This release expands upon the sounds and ideas of the more chaotic, improvisational tracks on their 2002 album, and is based entirely on live instrumentation and Joe Papa\'s unusually rapid [[scat singing]].

Although no new material was released after their 2003 album, Papa and Lemos made some live appearances as Breast Fed Yak in 2006, featuring Keith Abrams and Ron Anderson of [[Pak (band)|PAK]].

=== Compilations ===

Many reissues of older Controlled Bleeding material in various forms has appeared more recently. \'\'Shanked and Slithering\'\' (2005, Hospital Productions) is a compilation of previously released and unreleased noise material mostly from 1983 to 1986 which has been entirely remixed and remastered. 

In November 2007, the vinyl-only label Vinyl on Demand issued a limited 4-LP set composed of unreleased live and studio archive material called \'\'Songs from a Sewer of Dreams\'\'. There is a full LP of brand new music included with this box, as well as 3 LPs of recent and older archive material.

\'\'Before the Quiet\'\' (2008, MVD Audio) collects a full-length CD of material from the Lemos/Meola/Pecorino trio lineup of 1978\xe2\x80\x931981. 

Finally, a 4-CD compilation on Hong Kong label Ultra Mail Productions called \'\'Gibbering Canker-Opera Slaves\'\' was released in 2009, featuring both remastered cassette-only tracks and a large amount of new and old unreleased material; the track selection on this CD box set slightly overlaps the material on the LP box set \'\'Songs from a Sewer of Dreams\'\'. The box set is limited to 400 copies, 200 of which include a bonus 5th disc and are signed by Paul Lemos.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Controlled-Bleeding-Gibbering-Canker-Opera-Slaves-Studies-In-Meditation-And-Evisceration/release/2059730</ref>

Although Chris Moriarty and Paul Lemos had begun talking about reforming Skin Chamber, Moriarty died in Phoenix, Arizona on March 22, 2008.<ref name="myspace.com"/> Joe Papa died on November 23, 2009.<ref>http://www.myspace.com/controlledbleeding/blog</ref>

== Current status ==

Beginning in early 2010, Lemos began improvisational collaborations with Ron Anderson of [[Pak (band)|PAK]] and [[Weasel Walter]], and began preparing EPs of new material for Soleilmoon and Rich Black\'s label Winged Disk.<ref>http://www.myspace.com/controlledbleeding/blog/526998865</ref> Black compiled a series of short videos to go along with the group\'s short, layered pieces entitled "Bees (1-6)", which was posted on YouTube. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woix2v6lfOg Bees (1-6) video])

In 2011, Lemos has formed a new trio with original drummer Tony Meola and keyboardist Mike Bazini, and has recorded a new set of material with producer [[Martin Bisi]] (Swans, The Young Gods), which was released as "Odes to Bubbler" (Winged Disk / Soleilmoon, 2011). The new trio has played several live dates in the NYC area in that year, including shows at [[Cake Shop NYC]] and Silent Barn in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

In 2015 they released (anti)split album with the Italian band [[Sparkle in Grey]] entitled "Perversions of the Aging Savant" on the Belgian label Off Records, owned by the occasional drummer of [[Tuxedomoon]], Alain Lefebvre.

\'\'\'Delerium\'\'\' is a Canadian [[electronic music]]al duo that formed in 1987, originally as a side project of the influential [[industrial music]] act [[Front Line Assembly]].<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/293660/review/6068286 Chimera : Delerium : Review : Rolling Stone<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Throughout the band\xe2\x80\x99s history, their musical style has encompassed a broad range, including dark ethereal ambient [[trance music|trance]], voiceless industrial soundscapes, and electronic pop music. They are best known for their worldwide hit "[[Silence (song)|Silence]]".

==Members and history==
Delerium has traditionally been a two-person project, but the only constant member throughout its history has been [[Bill Leeb]]. Leeb was a guest musician and early supporter of industrial dance pioneers [[Skinny Puppy]], but after he left in 1986 he went on to create his own project, [[Front Line Assembly]] with collaborator Michael Balch. Later, the two worked on the side project Delerium and released their first album, \'\'[[Faces, Forms & Illusions]]\'\'. After Balch left both Front Line Assembly and Delerium, Leeb worked with [[Rhys Fulber]], and the two released several albums under the Delerium moniker; these years saw a gradual stylistic change from darker ambient to a more danceable sound. After the release of \'\'[[Karma (Delerium album)|Karma]]\'\', Fulber left to pursue other interests, and Leeb teamed up with producer [[Chris Peterson (producer)|Chris Peterson]] to release \'\'[[Poem (album)|Poem]]\'\'.  2003, however, saw the reunion of Leeb and Fulber for the release of \'\'[[Chimera (Delerium album)|Chimera]]\'\', followed by \'\'[[Nuages du Monde (album)|Nuages du Monde]]\'\' in 2006.

In contrast to Leeb and collaborators\' other projects, Delerium has included several guest [[vocalists]] since the release of \'\'[[Semantic Spaces]]\'\'.  These have included mostly women, such as [[Kristy Thirsk]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Leigh Nash]] (of [[Sixpence None the Richer]]), Elsieanne Caplette (of [[Elsiane]]), [[Lisa Gerrard]] (sampled only), [[Ja\xc3\xabl]] (of Swiss band [[Lunik]]), [[Camille Henderson]], [[Nerina Pallot]], [[Emily Haines]] (of [[Metric (band)|Metric]]), [[Jacqui Hunt]] (of [[Single Gun Theory]]), [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]] and [[Shelley Harland]]. Other than Leeb, only three males have contributed vocals to a Delerium album: [[Matthew Sweet]] ("Daylight", on \'\'Poem\'\'), Greg Froese ("Apparition", on \'\'Nuages du Monde\'\'), and Michael Logen ("Days Turn Into Nights", on the newest release \'\'Music Box Opera\'\'); in addition, the noted [[griot]] [[Baaba Maal]] was sampled ("Awakenings, on "[[Spiritual Archives]]").

The [[Medi\xc3\xa6val B\xc3\xa6bes]] provided the vocal track for, and starred in the video of, \'\'Aria\'\'; the vocals are an adapted version of the vocals from "All Turns to Yesterday" on the B\xc3\xa6bes\' \'\'[[Worldes Blysse]]\'\' album. They are also featured on two tracks from Delerium\'s 2006 album, \'\'Nuages du Monde\'\'.

Although it may be argued that Front Line Assembly has the largest cult following of all Leeb and associates projects, Delerium is undoubtedly the most financially successful. In addition to these two mainstays, related projects of the Leeb, Fulber, Peterson, Balch family include [[Equinox (electro-industrial band)|Equinox]], [[Intermix (band)|Intermix]], [[Noise Unit]], [[Pro-Tech]], and [[Syn\xc3\xa6sthesia (Canadian band)|Syn\xc3\xa6sthesia]], among others.  In addition, in 2007 Leeb and Fulber collaborated with Leigh Nash under the name [[Fauxliage]], also Rhys Fulber maintains his solo project [[Conjure One]] since his temporary exit from Delerium.

==Music==
The single "[[Silence (song)|Silence]]", featuring vocals by [[Sarah McLachlan]], reached number three on the [[UK]] [[music chart]]s. In 2000, three years after \'\'Karma\'\' was released, notable [[DJ]]s such as [[Ti\xc3\xabsto]] and [[Airscape]] produced [[remix]]es of "Silence", which generated interest and gained considerable radio [[airplay]] for the original track.<ref name="about.com.review">{{cite web | author = Rivaldo, Joey | date = | url = http://dancemusic.about.com/od/reviews/fr/DeleriumSil2k4.htm | title = Delerium - Silence 2004 | work = | publisher = about.com | accessdate = 2008-11-10 }}</ref><ref name="mindphaser2005">{{cite web | author = Bauer, Henrik | date = August 14, 2005 | url = http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=739 | title = Bill Leeb > Noise Unit 2005 Interview | format = | work = | publisher = Mindphaser.com | accessdate = 2006-06-17 }}</ref>

In 2003, Delerium embarked on their first tour, with vocals performed by [[Kristy Thirsk]] and Shelley Harland. In January 2005, Delerium performed at the \'\'One World\'\' [[benefit concert]] in [[Vancouver]] for the [[2004 Asian tsunami]], where "Silence" was performed live for the first time with [[Sarah McLachlan]]. The song has been described as one of the greatest trance songs of all time.<ref name="about.com.review"/>

\'\'\'Nine Inch Nails\'\'\' (abbreviated and stylized as  \'\'\'NI\xd0\x98\'\'\') is an American [[industrial rock]] band, founded in 1988 by [[Trent Reznor]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. As its main [[producer (music)|producer]], singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor is the only official member of the group and remains solely responsible for its direction.<ref name = "AMG">{{cite web| author = Huey, Steve| url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nine-inch-nails-mn0000351733/biography| title = Nine Inch Nails| accessdate = November 24, 2006| publisher = [[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Nine Inch Nails\' music straddles a wide range of genres. After recording a new album, Reznor usually assembles [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band]] to perform with him. The touring band features a revolving lineup that often rearranges songs to fit a live setting. On stage, Nine Inch Nails often employs visual elements to accompany performances, which frequently include light shows.<ref name = "Reimink">{{Cite news| last = Reimink| first = Troy| title = Changes in songs, lineup keep Nails sharp| work = [[Grand Rapids Press]]|publisher=[[Booth Newspapers]]| page = D1| date = March 5, 2007}}</ref>

[[Underground music]] audiences warmly received Nine Inch Nails in its early years. Reznor produced several highly influential records in the 1990s that achieved widespread popularity: many Nine Inch Nails songs became radio hits;<ref name = "Allmusic charts">{{cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5033|pure_url=yes}}| title = Nine inch Nails > Charts & Awards| publisher = [[AllMusic]]| accessdate = August 15, 2009}}</ref> and [[Nine Inch Nails discography|their entire catalog]] has reached record sales exceeding over 20&nbsp;million albums worldwide,<ref name="Yahoo!Court" /> with 10&nbsp;million sales certified in the United States alone.<ref name="RIAAbestsellers" /> In 1997, Reznor appeared in \'\'[[Time (magazine)|Time]]\'\' magazine\'s list of the year\'s most influential people, and \'\'Spin\'\' magazine described him as "the most vital artist in music."<ref name="Time">{{Cite journal| url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986206-18,00.html| title = Time\'s 25 most influential Americans| journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| publisher = [[Time Inc.]] ([[Time Warner]])| date = April 21, 1997| volume = 149| issue = 16| page = 66| accessdate = April 15, 2008}}</ref>
In 2004, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' placed Nine Inch Nails at 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.<ref name="Bowie" /> Despite this acclaim, the band has had several feuds with the corporate side of the recording industry. In 2007, these corporate entanglements resulted in Reznor announcing that Nine Inch Nails would split from its label and release future material independently.<ref name="BBFreeAgent" />

Since 1989, Nine Inch Nails has released eight studio albums. After a hiatus from 2009 to 2013, Nine Inch Nails released \'\'[[Hesitation Marks]]\'\', through [[Columbia Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kroq.cbslocal.com/2013/06/05/nine-inch-nails-premieres-came-back-haunted-from-new-album-hesitation-marks/ |title=Nine Inch Nails Premieres \'Came Back Haunted\' From New Album \'Hesitation Marks\'  |publisher=KROQ|date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> Prior to this, \'\'[[Ghosts I\xe2\x80\x93IV]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]\'\' were both independently released in digital form, with physical releases coming later.

Nine Inch Nails has been nominated for thirteen [[Grammy Award]]s and won twice for the songs "[[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|Wish]]" and "[[Happiness in Slavery]]", in 1992 and 1996 respectively.

In 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboard with a [[Cleveland]] band called the [[Exotic Birds]], then managed by [[John Malm, Jr.]]<ref name="NIN Spin 1996">{{cite book|publisher=Spin Media LLC|title=SPIN|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA5|date=February 1996|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |page=5|id={{ISSN|08863032}}}}</ref> Reznor and Malm became friends,<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 22</ref> and when Reznor left the Exotic Birds to work on music of his own, Malm informally became his manager.<ref>\'\'Reznor v.

Three music videos were created in promotion of the album. [[MTV]] aired the videos for "Down in It" and "Head Like a Hole", but an explicit video for "Sin" was only released in partial form for \'\'[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]\'\'.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 44</ref> The original version of the "Down in It" video ended with the implication that Reznor\'s character had fallen off a building and died in the street. This footage attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. As Reznor explains in an interview with \'\'Convulsion Magazine\'\':

<blockquote>There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a \'\'[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]\'\'-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it&nbsp;... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere&nbsp;... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer\'s field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it\'s a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it\'s some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, \'yeah, he\'s rotting,\' (I had corn starch on me, right) \'he\'s been decomposing for 3 weeks.\' You could see the other members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.5.html| title = Nine Inch Nails| accessdate = April 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115015943/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/1.5.html|archivedate=November 15, 2008|author=Bains, Jon|work=Convulsion Magazine}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1989, while doing promotion for the album, the band were asked what shows they would like to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) that they would like to appear on [[Dance Party USA]], since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gawker.com/5897544/heres-video-of-nine-inch-nails-performing-on-dance-party-usa-22-years-ago| accessdate=January 12, 2014| title=Here\'s Video of Nine Inch Nails Performing on Dance Party USA 22 Years Ago| publisher=[[Gawker]]| date=March 29, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1990, Nine Inch Nails began the \'\'[[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series]]\'\', in which they toured North America as an opening act for [[alternative rock]] artists such as [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref name="AMG" /><ref>Huxley (1997), p. 45</ref> Reznor began [[Instrument destruction|smashing his equipment]] while on stage; \'\'Rockbeat\'\' interviewer Mike Gitter attributed the live band\'s early success in front of rock oriented audiences to this aggressive attitude.<ref name = "Rockbeat">{{cite web|title= The Man Behind the Machine |url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/xart198.shtml |first=Mike |last=Gitter |work=Rockbeat|year= 1992}}</ref> Nine Inch Nails then embarked on a world tour that continued through the first [[Lollapalooza]] festival in 1991.<ref name="NIN Spin 1996" />

After a poor European reception opening for [[Guns N\' Roses]], the band returned to America amid pressure from TVT to produce a follow-up to \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\'.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 52</ref> After finding out they were hindering control of his project, Reznor criticized the labeling of Nine Inch Nails as a [[synthpop]] band<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 57</ref> and demanded his label terminate his contract, but they ignored his plea.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=6141| title = Nine Inch Nails : Happiness Is Slavery| author = Greene, Jo-Ann| work = Musician Magazine| date = February 21, 2001| accessdate = September 30, 2010}}</ref> In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference.<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Nine Inch Nails |journal= [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |date=March 1994|page=}}</ref> Involved in a feud with TVT, he signed a record deal with [[Interscope Records]] and created [[Nothing Records]]:

<blockquote>We made it very clear we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren\'t ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I\'ve finally got this thing going but it\'s dead. Flood and I had to record \'\'Broken\'\' under a different band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. [[Jimmy Iovine]] got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn\'t my doing. I didn\'t know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.<ref name="NIN Spin 1996" /></blockquote>

In 1992, Nine Inch Nails relocated to [[10050 Cielo Drive, Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles]] (renamed "Le Pig" by Reznor), the site of the [[Tate-LaBianca murders|Tate murders]], when [[Charles Manson]]\'s "family" murdered [[Sharon Tate]],<ref name="Huxley 1997 p. 97">Huxley (1997), p. 97</ref> wife of noted film director [[Roman Polanski]], and four of her friends.<ref name = "AMG" /><ref name="NIN Spin 1996" /> It was used for the band to record \'\'Broken\'\', an [[extended play]] (EP) that was the first release distributed by Nothing Records<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 62</ref> and reached the top 10 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200.<ref name="NIN Spin 1996" /> In the liner notes, Reznor credited the 1991 [[List of Nine Inch Nails live-band members|Nine Inch Nails touring band]] as an influence on the EP\'s sound.<ref>\'\'[[Broken (EP)|Broken]]\'\' ([[Interscope Records]]/[[Nothing Records|nothing]]/TVT, September 22, 1992) packaging; liner notes.</ref> He characterized \'\'Broken\'\' as a guitar-based "blast of destruction", and as "a lot harder&nbsp;... than \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\'".<ref name="Shock" /> The inspiration for the harder sound came from the way the live band played during concerts such as Lollapalooza.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Larkin|editor1-first=Colin|chapter=Nine Inch Nails|title=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Songs from \'\'Broken\'\' earned Nine Inch Nails two Grammy Awards: a performance of the EP\'s first single "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" from [[Woodstock \'94]],<ref name = "AwardsDatabase" /> and the second single "[[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|Wish]]".<ref name="AwardsDatabase" /> In reference to receiving the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] for "Wish", Reznor joked his epitaph should read: "REZNOR: Died. Said \'fist fuck\', won a Grammy."<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 65</ref> Against touring of the brand new material, Reznor began living and recording full-time at Le Pig, working on a follow-up free of restrictions from his record label.<ref name="NIN Spin 1996" />

\'\'Broken\'\' was followed by its companion remix EP \'\'[[Fixed (EP)|Fixed]]\'\' in late 1992.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 80</ref> The only track that was left off the final version of the release is [[Butch Vig]]\'s remix of "Last" (the outro of the "Last" remix is heard in "Throw This Away", which also includes Vig\'s remix of "Suck").<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 82</ref>  The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11&nbsp;kHz file, "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by [[FTP]] from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|p2p]] networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com).<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 84</ref>  Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction.

The music video for "Closer" was directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and received frequent rotation on MTV, though the network heavily censored the original version, which they perceived to be too graphic. The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion, sexuality, animal cruelty, politics, and terror; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a [[crucifix]] mask, a monkey tied to a [[cross]], a pig\'s head spinning on some type of machine, a diagram of a [[vulva]], Reznor wearing an [[Sadomasochism|S&M]] mask while swinging in shackles, and of him wearing a [[ball gag]].<ref name="Closer video">{{cite web| title = Nine Inch Nails: Closure (VHS)| publisher = DeepFocus.com| url = http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/closure.html| accessdate = August 26, 2007}}</ref>  A radio edit that partially mutes the song\'s explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime.<ref name="NIN Spin 1996" />

Critical response to \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\' has generally been favorable, and retrospective reviews regard it as one of the most important albums of the 1990s.

After the 1994 release of \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\', the live band embarked on the [[Self Destruct Tour]] in support of the album. The stage set-up contained dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as "Hurt". The tour debuted the band\'s grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves, and they would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.<ref name="Huxley Page 54">Huxley (1997), p. 54</ref> The tour reached its widest mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at [[Woodstock \'94]] that was broadcast on [[Pay-Per-View]] and seen in as many as 24&nbsp;million homes.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 125</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16319994.html| title = Feedback muddy from Woodstock PPV| author = Umstead, R.

Five years elapsed between \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\' and Nine Inch Nails\' next studio album, \'\'[[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]]\'\', which arrived as a [[double album]] in September 1999.<ref name="Bleak" /> \'\'The Fragile\'\' was conceived by making "songwriting and arranging and production and sound design&nbsp;... the same thing.

Reznor followed \'\'The Fragile\'\' with another remix album, \'\'[[Things Falling Apart]]\'\', released in November 2000 to poor reviews, a few months after the 2000 \'\'[[Fragility Tour|Fragility]]\'\' tour which itself was recorded and released on CD, DVD, and VHS in 2002 as \'\'[[And All That Could Have Been]]\'\'. A deluxe edition of the live CD came with the companion disc \'\'[[And All That Could Have Been#Still|Still]]\'\', featuring stripped-down versions of songs from the Nine Inch Nails catalog along with several new pieces of music.<ref name="Machian"/>

[[AllMusic]]\'s Steve Huey states that "Nine Inch Nails were the most popular [[industrial music|industrial]] group ever and were largely responsible for bringing the music to a mass audience."<ref name="AMG" /> Reznor has never referred to his own work as industrial music, but admits to borrowing techniques from such early industrial bands as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Test Dept.]]<ref name="Axcess" /> Despite the disparity between those artists initially operating under the term "industrial" and Nine Inch Nails, it has become common in journalistic descriptions of Reznor\'s body of work to describe it as such.

Certain techniques and styles can be found throughout Nine Inch Nails\' catalog.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 165</ref> Songs such as "[[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|Wish]]", and "[[The Day the World Went Away]]" exhibit terraced [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]. Reznor\'s singing follows a similar pattern, frequently moving from whispers to screams. He also has used software to alter his voice in several songs, as evident in "Starfuckers, Inc." and "[[Burn (Nine Inch Nails song)|Burn]]".

Nine Inch Nails\' earliest influences include [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Skinny Puppy]], which helped shape what became 1989\'s \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\'.<ref name=AMG /> The album\'s liner notes also paid tribute to the hip-hop group [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=wapo_klein>{{cite news|last1=Klein|first1=Joshua|title=Nine Inch Nails\' Body Of Work Gains \'Teeth\'|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/03/AR2005050301368.html|accessdate=December 17, 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 4, 2005}}</ref> Another large influence on the band\'s sound is [[Gary Numan]], which is evident as Reznor has been credited with saying, "after hearing \'[[Cars (song)|Cars]]\' I knew I wanted to make music with synthesizers."<ref name=mervis_gazette>{{cite news|last1=Mervis|first1=Scott|title=Synth-rock pioneer Gary Numan adds a shot of industrial power|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2014/03/20/Synth-rock-pioneer-Gary-Numan-adds-a-shot-of-industrial-power/stories/201403200114|accessdate=January 2, 2015|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}</ref> The 2005 single "[[Only (Nine Inch Nails song)|Only]]" exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan\'s persuasion.<ref name=wapo_klein /> Other artists of significance to Nine Inch Nails encompass late 70s and 80s acts such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Joy Division]] and [[Adam Ant]].<ref name=wapo_klein />

Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from "generic imitations" dating from his initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a "truer, less imitative way".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Geoff Rickly interviews Trent Reznor| url=http://www.theninhotline.net/archives/articles/manager/display_article.php?id=11 |last = Rickly| first = Geoff |authorlink= Geoff Rickly| work = [[Alternative Press]]| date = June 26, 2004}}</ref> Following the release of \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\', mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails\' influence: David Bowie compared Reznor\'s impact to that of [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name="Bowie">{{Cite web| title = Nine Inch Nails| last = Bowie| first = David| authorlink = David Bowie| work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date =April 21, 2005| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090506001940/http://rollingstone.com/news/story/7250012/94_nine_inch_nails| archivedate = May 6, 2009| accessdate = March 13, 2007}}</ref> Bob Ezrin, producer for [[Pink Floyd]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Peter Gabriel]], described Reznor in 2007 as a "true visionary" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://torontoist.com/2007/04/thank_god_for_t.php| title = \'Thank God for Trent Reznor\'| work = [[Gothamist|The Torontoist]]|publisher= Ink Truck Media| date = April 19, 2007| accessdate = April 20, 2007| first = Marc| last = Lostracco}}</ref> Nine Inch Nails has been credited by music journalists for popularizing industrial music, despite ambivalence from Reznor.<ref name="AMG" /><ref name="Huxley Page 46">Huxley (1997), p. 46\xe2\x80\x9347</ref>

Reznor is the sole official member of Nine Inch Nails. However, he has typically formed a backing group of musicians to perform the songs in a live setting. This live band, also known as Nine Inch Nails, rearranges the band\'s studio catalog and creates a different sound than that of Reznor\'s studio recordings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zahlaway|first1=Jon|title=Live Review: Nine Inch Nails in Boston|url=http://www.livedaily.com/reviews/Live_Review_Nine_Inch_Nails_in_Boston-8158.html|publisher=[[LiveDaily]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070601044050/http://www.livedaily.com/reviews/Live_Review_Nine_Inch_Nails_in_Boston-8158.html|archivedate=June 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DVD Review: Nine Inch Nails Live|url=http://media.www.westerncourier.com/media/storage/paper650/news/2007/03/23/TheEdge/Dvd-Review.Nine.Inch.Nails.Live-2789289.shtml|publisher=[[Western Courier]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427085045/http://media.www.westerncourier.com/media/storage/paper650/news/2007/03/23/TheEdge/Dvd-Review.Nine.Inch.Nails.Live-2789289.shtml|archivedate=April 27, 2009}}</ref> Band members have occasionally been invited to participate in the recording process, but creative control within the studio has always been exclusively with Reznor.<ref name="Huxley 1997, p. 170"/>

The [[Tapeworm (band)|Tapeworm]] project was created in 1995 as a Nine Inch Nails side-project between Reznor and various live-band members as a more "democratic" creative environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wiederhorn|first1=Jon|title=Nine Inch Nails, Tool Frontmen Recording Together|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1456878/nine-inch-nails-tool-frontmen-recording-together/|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title = Pretty Quake Machine| first = Paul| last = Semel| journal = Incite| date=June 2000| issue = 7

The lineup of the live band had a tendency to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes,<ref>{{cite episode| title = Trent Reznor talks to Ian Camfield| network = [[Xfm London]]| airdate = July 22, 2005
}}</ref> as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.

==Corporate disputes==
Reznor is an outspoken critic of the music industry, particularly the influence that music businesses have exerted upon his creative freedom. Nine Inch Nails has clashed with several music industry corporations, culminating in Reznor\'s decision to proceed as an independent artist who does not employ the financial backing of the music industry to fund his creative output.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 48</ref>

===TVT Records===
In the early 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was involved in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label\'s attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = "Shock" /> Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.<ref>Huxley (1997), p. 55</ref> In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite web|title=Court Holds Reznor/Malm Contract Not Unconscionable|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of three million US dollars.<ref name = "E!

At the behest of [[Prudential Financial|Prudential Securities]] bankruptcy proceedings, TVT put the rights to Reznor\'s recordings for the label on auction in 2005. This offer included the whole TVT catalog, including \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\' and a percentage of royalties from Reznor\'s song publishing company, Leaving Hope Music/TVT Music. [[Rykodisc]], which did not win the auction but was able to license the rights from Prudential, reissued the out-of-print \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\' CD on November 22, 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=05&m=10#1130439320| title = Rykodisk to reissue pretty hate machine *updated*| publisher = The NIN Hotline| date = October 27, 2005| accessdate = November 28, 2006}}</ref> Ryko also reissued the "Head Like a Hole" CD and a vinyl edition of \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\' in 2006. The label considered releasing a deluxe edition, just as Interscope had done for \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\'. They were influenced by Reznor and liked the idea, but did not want to pay him for the album and the idea was scrapped.<ref name = "Toronto Sun">{{cite web| url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/N/Nine_Inch_Nails/2005/11/07/1296952.html| title = Reznor grits his teeth| author = Ladouceur, Liisa| work=[[The Toronto Sun]]\'\'|publisher= [[Sun Media]]| date = November 8, 2005| accessdate = May 14, 2008

===Universal Music Group===
In May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website skeptical of [[Universal Music Group]] (parent company of Nine Inch Nails\' record label, [[Interscope Records]]) for their pricing and distribution plans for \'\'Year Zero.\'\'<ref name="RollingStoneKreps">{{cite web| last = Kreps| first = Daniel| title = Nine Inch Nails\' Trent Reznor Slams Records Labels for Sorry State of the Industry| work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]| date = May 14, 2007| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/| accessdate = April 12, 2011|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080406103223/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/14/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-slams-records-labels-for-sorry-state-of-the-industry/|archivedate=April 6, 2008}}</ref> He labeled the company\'s retail pricing of \'\'Year Zero\'\' in Australia as "ABSURD", concluding that "as a reward for being a \'true fan\' you get ripped off." Reznor went on to say that he hated Interscope, and in later years the "climate" of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music.<ref name="UMG">{{cite web| url = http://www.nin.com/tr| accessdate = August 22, 2007| last = Reznor| first = Trent| title = Updates from Trent| date = May 13, 2007| publisher = Nine Inch Nails| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070517041353rn_1/nin.com/tr/| archivedate = May 17, 2007}}</ref> Reznor\'s post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.<ref name="Reznor Smashes UMG">{{cite web| title = Reznor Smashes UMG, Websites Write About It| publisher = The NIN Hotline| date = May 17, 2007| url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&m=5#1179461909| accessdate = May 19, 2007}}</ref> In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on UMG at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/steal-away-steal-steal-and-steal-some-more/2007/09/18/1189881482912.html| title = Nails frontman urges fans to steal music| work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]| date = September 18, 2007| accessdate = September 18, 2007| last = Moses| first = Asher}}</ref> Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin\'."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=07&m=9#1189989696| title = Trent follows up on Universal AU| publisher = The NIN Hotline| date = September 16, 2007| accessdate = September 18, 2007}}</ref>

Reznor announced on October 8, 2007, that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope Records and was now free to proceed as a "totally free agent, free of any recording contract with any label".<ref name="BBFreeAgent">{{cite web| last = Cohen| first = Jonathan| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1048419/nine-inch-nails-celebrates-free-agent-status| title = Nine Inch Nails Celebrates Free Agent Status| accessdate = August 15, 2009| work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company]]| date = October 8, 2007}}</ref> Reznor also speculated that he would release the next Nine Inch Nails album online in a similar fashion to \'\'[[The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!]]\'\', which he produced.<ref>{{cite web| work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher= New York Media| author = Westhoff, Ben| url = http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/10/trent_reznor_and_saul_williams.html| title = Trent Reznor and Saul Williams discuss their new collaboration...| date = October 30, 2007| accessdate = October 31, 2007}}</ref> Reznor later released the first nine tracks of \'\'[[Ghosts I\xe2\x80\x93IV]]\'\' and the entirety of \'\'[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]\'\' in 2008 for free download.

In another post on his website, Reznor again openly criticized Universal Music Group for preventing him from launching an official interactive fan remix website. Universal declined to host the site just days before its scheduled launch, citing the potential "accusation", in Reznor\'s words, "that they are sponsoring the same technical violation of copyright they are suing [other media companies] for".<ref>{{cite web| work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]| author = Kreps, Daniel| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/20/trent-reznor-puts-new-nin-site-on-hold-warns-of-apocalyptical-lawsuit/| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122163426/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/20/trent-reznor-puts-new-nin-site-on-hold-warns-of-apocalyptical-lawsuit/ |archivedate=November 22, 2007| title = Trent Reznor puts new NIN site on hold| date = November 20, 2007| accessdate = November 21, 2007}}</ref> Reznor wrote in response that he was "challenged at the last second to find a way of bringing this idea to life without getting splashed by the urine as these media companies piss all over each other\'s feet".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/music-industry/universals-legal-tangles-with-youtube-kill-official-nine-inch-nails-fan-remix-site-326634.php| work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]| title = Universal\'s Legal Tangles With YouTube Kill Official Nine Inch Nails Fan Remix Site| date = November 26, 2007| accessdate = January 29, 2008}}</ref> Despite these obstacles, the remix website was launched in November 2007.

===Other corporations===
Nine Inch Nails was scheduled to perform at the 2005 [[MTV Movie Awards]], but withdrew from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of [[George W. Bush]] as a backdrop to the band\'s performance of "[[The Hand That Feeds]]". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: "apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me."<ref name="E! Online" /> MTV replied that it respected Reznor\'s point of view, but was "uncomfortable" with the performance being "built around partisan political statements."

In 2006, after being alerted by a fan website, Reznor issued a [[cease and desist]] to [[Fox News Channel]] for using three songs from \'\'The Fragile\'\' on air without permission. The songs "La Mer", "The Great Below", and "The Mark Has Been Made" appeared in an episode of \'\'[[War Stories with Oliver North]]\'\' detailing the [[battle of Iwo Jima]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue.php?y=06&m=10#1161617908| title = Fox News, War Stories, and Nine Inch Nails| publisher = The NIN Hotline| date = October 23, 2006| accessdate = November 29, 2006}}</ref> A post appeared on Reznor\'s blog, which read: "Thanks for the Fox News heads-up.

As part of the alternate reality game which accompanied the release of \'\'Year Zero\'\', three tracks from the album were intentionally "leaked" prior to their official release at a number of Nine Inch Nails concerts on [[USB flash drive]]s.<ref name="CoolerThanLost" /> The high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet, and owners of websites hosting the files soon received cease and desist orders from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], despite the fact that the viral campaign, and the use of USB drives, was sanctioned by Nine Inch Nails\' record label.<ref name="BillboardPaolette">{{cite web| last = Paoletta| first = Michael| title = Online Odyssey Stoking Interest In New NIN Album| work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Company]]| date = March 30, 2007| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053298/online-odyssey-stoking-interest-in-new-nin-album| accessdate = May 20, 2007}}</ref> The source that broke the story was quoted as saying, "These fucking idiots are going after a campaign that the label signed off on."<ref name="BillboardPaolette" />

The music of Nine Inch Nails has reportedly been used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] as [[music torture]] to break down the resolve of detainees.<ref>{{cite web| title = Musicians don\'t want tunes used for torture| publisher = [[MSNBC]].

If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities.

Aside from disagreements over the usage of Nine Inch Nails material, some corporations have dismissed content due to perceived obscenity. In 2009, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] rejected an update to Nine Inch Nails\' [[iPhone]] application, \'\'NIN: Access\'\', because it found \'\'The Downward Spiral\'\' to contain "offensive or obscene content", referring to the lyrical content.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=42064_0_2_0_C| title = Nine Inch Nails\' iPhone application gets the boot from Apple| work=[[Side-Line]]|publisher=Seba Dolimont| date = March 4, 2009| accessdate = May 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name=bbc_apple>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8039779.stm| title = Reznor takes a byte out of Apple| work = [[BBC News]]| date = May 8, 2009}}</ref> Reznor criticized their decision, citing the audio was also available through the [[iTunes]] application.<ref name=bbc_apple />

A similar incident involving digital content distribution occurred in 2013 when Nine Inch Nails re-released the original 1993 film \'\'[[Broken (1993 film)|Broken]]\'\' on [[Vimeo]]. Within hours of launch, the video was removed due to a terms of service violation on material that "harass, incite hatred or depict excessive violence."<ref>{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/nineinchnails/status/331488703950229505/photo/1| title = nineinchnails: And just like that, the Broken...| publisher = [[Twitter]]| accessdate = May 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/6/4305438/underground-nine-inch-nails-snuff-film-finally-officially-released| title = Nine Inch Nails\' 20-year old \'Broken\' film is too violent for Vimeo (update)| work=The Verge|publisher=Nathan Ingraham| date = May 6, 2013| accessdate = May 6, 2013}}</ref>

\'\'\'The Axis of Perdition\'\'\' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[industrial music|industrial]] [[black metal]] band, from [[Middlesbrough]]. It was signed to Code666 Records.

The band rose from the ashes of \'\'Minethorn \'\'and consists of Tetsuo Unit BRJ (a.k.a. Brooke Johnson, vocals, guitars, bass and programming) and Test Subject MGB (a.k.a. Michael Blenkarn, guitars, keyboards and programming).<ref name="Rivadavia">Rivadavia, Eduardo "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p559536/biography|pure_url=yes}} Axis of Perdition Biography]", \'\'[[Allmusic]]\'\', Macrovision Corporation</ref>

==Music==
The Axis of Perdition\'s output comprises [[black metal]] experimentation with [[industrial music]] and [[dark ambient]] textures. The Axis of Perdition\'s debut album stated that "Axis of Perdition plays something there isn\'t words for yet (exclusively)".

Their sound is primarily based on distorted guitars with [[black metal]] vocals, programmed drums, and discordant sound effects including screams and static. The [[black metal]] aspects of the music are digitally distorted, interspersed with atmospheric soundscapes formed by synthesizers and field recordings. The Axis of Perdition\'s tracks tend to feature shifting free-form arrangements that lack a typical verse-chorus structure and tend toward lengthiness (one such track, from \'\'Deleted Scenes from the Transition Hospital\'\', is over twelve minutes long).

Tapping inspiration from [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Ramsey Campbell]] and the \'\'[[Silent Hill]]\'\' games (their EP \'\'Physical Illucinations in the Sewer of Xuchilbara\'\' is named for the dark deity of the games) as well themes of urban decay and mental illness, The Axis of Perdition are often compared to groups like [[Anaal Nathrakh]]<ref>[http://www.bnrmetal.com/groups/aop.htm BNR Metal biography]</ref> and [[Blut Aus Nord]]<ref>[http://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/001523.html Bagatellen review]</ref> for their similar grim, urban [[industrial metal]] aesthetics.

In 2013, the group separated due to a mutual agreement between Blenkarn and Johnson, but it is unknown whether this is either a permanent or temporary. 

==Final line-up==
* [[Brooke Johnson]] - Vocals, Jazz Guitar, Ambience. (also member of the bands [[Mine(thorn)]], Halo of the Sun, Pulsefear, Hesper Payne, Nord, Irradiant and Monument)
* [[Michael Blenkarn]] - Lead & Rhythm Guitar, Keyboard & Piano, Programming, Ambience. (also member of the bands Wodensthrone and Phaleg)
* [[Ian Fenwick]] - Bass Guitar. (also member of the band [[Mine(thorn)]] and Hesper Payne)
* [[Dan Mullins]] - Live Drums & Percussion. (Also a member of [[The Raven Theory]] ex-[[Bal-Sagoth]], and [[My Dying Bride]], amongst others)

The band recorded a demo of the song "Pandemonium", which was distributed among different record labels. After receiving good responses the band signed a deal with [[Tabu Recordings]] and released their first full length \'\'[[Monument Bineothan]]\'\' which got the band nominated in the 35th Annual [[Spellemannsprisen]] for the metal category against [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Gorgoroth]], and [[Keep of Kalessin]].<ref name=Award /> In August 2007 the band announced on their website that they would soon be recording their follow-up to "Monument" with acclaimed Danish producer [[Tue Madsen]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Producer Tue Madsen | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=79712}}</ref>

\'\'\'Mortal\'\'\' was a Christian [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[dance music|dance]] band fronted by [[Jerome Fontamillas]] and [[Jyro Xhan]]. Both members went on to found the [[alternative rock]] group [[Fold Zandura]], and for a time were members of both bands simultaneously. The band is known for its lyrical intelligence, incorporating advanced [[theology]] with what has been billed as "Industrial Praise and Worship."<ref name="Berman">{{cite web|url=http://tlem.netcentral.net/reviews/96/mortal_rev.html |title=Review: Mortal by Mortal |last=Berman |first=Ed |publisher=The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000712104223/http://tlem.netcentral.net/reviews/96/mortal_rev.html |archivedate=July 12, 2000}}</ref> According to \'\'[[CCM Magazine]]\'\' "Mortal has had a much greater influence... on industrial music than its modest output would suggest."<ref name="CCM_17_7"/>

==Background==

Led by the duo [[Jerome Fontamillas]] and [[Jyro Xhan]], Mortal was one of the first Christian bands to play industrial metal.<ref name="Sue">{{cite web |url= http://www.suezine.fi/haastattelut?t=1&sid=87 |title= White Metal |accessdate= 2007-09-07 |author= Lahtonen, Jussi |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 2005-10-25 |format= |work= Sue Rock Punk Metal Zine |publisher= |pages= |language= Finnish |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> While not actually the first to do so, Mortal enjoyed significant success, and, along with other early contemporaries such as [[Circle of Dust]] and [[Argyle Park]], played a notable role in paving the way for future Christian industrial and industrial metal bands.

The group began in 1988 as Mortal Wish, and  produced a six-song demo with additional members Ray Tongpo and Wilson Peralta.<ref name="AMG Mortal">{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p169755|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic  ((( Mortal > Overview  ))) |publisher=\'\'[[Allmusic]]\'\'}}</ref> They shortened their name, signed a record deal with Intense Records and released their first album \'\'[[Lusis]]\'\' in 1992, produced by [[Terry Scott Taylor]]<ref name="AMG Mortal" /> and Allan Aguirre of [[Scaterd Few]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} It was well received by the critics, with \'\'[[CCM Magazine]]\'\' dubbing \'\'Lusis\'\' the "strongest debut project to enter the Christian market in years."<ref name="CCM_14_9"/> The second album \'\'[[Fathom (album)|Fathom]]\'\' (1993) was Mortal\'s most guitar-driven, and became one of the band\'s most popular releases.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Mortal/LusisFathom/519/ |title= Mortal |accessdate= 2007-10-13 |last=Figgis |first= Alex |date= 1999-10-01 |format= |work= Cross Rhythms |publisher= Open Publishing |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=Nothing rivals such true genre classics as \'Neplusultra", \'Rift\' or the phenomenal \'Bright Wings\'. Truly a musical milestone any industrial dance/rock/metal fan would appreciate. }}</ref> The song \xe2\x80\x9dRift\xe2\x80\x9d was rearranged later and a music video was shot for it in 1994. The video dealt with the horrors of child abuse.

Mortal later experimented with a live band,<ref name="CCM_17_7"/> and a [[grunge]] sound on 1994\'s \'\'[[Wake (Mortal album)|Wake]]\'\',<ref name="CM53"/>  as well as with a [[dance music|dance]]-based [[meditation music|meditational]] sound on their follow-up, \'\'[[Pura (album)|Pura]]\'\'.<ref name="CM33" />

During this time, the band became mired in legal issues involving their label, leading to on-again, off-again attempts to retire the name Mortal. As Gyro would report to \'\'[[True Tunes News]]\'\' in 1994: "I have peace with the fact that Mortal will permanently quit... There are legal things happening with our label that will end Mortal as a name."<ref name="TTN_6_11">{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John J. |authorlink=John J. Thompson |title=Too Young To Die: An Interview With Mortal |pages=18 |date=Spring 1994 |volume=6 |issue=11 |journal=[[True Tunes News]]}}</ref> The duo formed [[Fold Zandura]] partly to get around these issues, partly to carve out a more alternative rock sound. Fold Zandura released one album and three EPs.

The Mortal moniker was revived in order to release  a self-titled album on [[5 Minute Walk]] Records in 1996. According to the liner notes, three songs were originally Fold Zandura songs. In 1998 they released a best of called \'\'Godspeed\'\'. It featured 13 album songs and 2 non-album songs.

In 2000 Jerome joined [[Switchfoot]] as a session musician and later joined them full-time.

In 2002 Jyro and Jerome released a Mortal reunion album called \'\'[[Nu-En-Jin]]\'\' with [[Tooth & Nail Records]], featuring an updated industrial sound, consisting mostly of heavily distorted looping electronics. Lyrically, the songs have a very sci-fi flare, with the liner notes detailing the various fictional alternative universes in which they are supposedly set.

\'\'\'Mindless Self Indulgence\'\'\' (often identified using the abbreviation \'\'\'MSI\'\'\') is an American [[electronic rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 1997. Their music has a mixed style which includes [[punk rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[electronica]], [[techno]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[breakbeat hardcore]]. MSI has also been known to define themselves as "electro-punk jungle pussy" or "industrial jungle pussy punk".<ref>http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories06/june/0609067.htm</ref>  Their group name is derived from a solo EP that frontman [[Jimmy Urine]] wrote in 1995.

==History==
The group was formed in 1997 when Jimmy Urine was joined by [[Steve, Righ?]] on guitar, Urine\'s brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist [[Lyn-Z]]), and Urine\'s cousin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elftown.com/_Mindless%20Facts |title=Mindless Facts |publisher=Elftown.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> [[Kitty (drummer)|Kitty]] on drums. They have released five albums, two EPs, one live album, and one live DVD. Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.

The group maintains a devout fanbase, and has opened for many well-known acts such as [[Linkin Park]], [[System of a Down]], [[Korn]], [[Sum 41]], [[Insane Clown Posse]] and [[Rammstein]]. Notable bands who have opened for them include [[The Red Paintings]],  [[The Dresden Dolls]], [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], [[mc chris]], [[The Birthday Massacre]], [[Tub Ring]], [[Death Spells]], and [[Dog Fashion Disco]]. In January 2009, the band headlined the [[Kerrang!]] Relentless Energy Drink tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1302301/kerrang-tour-returns-in-2009 |title=Kerrang! Tour Returns in 2009 |first=Jen |last=Wilson |work=Billboard |date=October 22, 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>

In December 2010, they released a comic entitled \'\'Adventures Into Mindless Self Indulgence\'\' about various tour stories and significant moments of the band\'s career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=29278 |title=Mindless Self Indulgence to Sign New Book at Two West Coast Events |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> The band released a remastered CD/DVD version of their first full length album, \'\'[[Tight (album)|Tight]]\'\', in 2011, entitled \'\'Tighter\'\'. It included bonus tracks and recordings from their early days. On October 25, 2012, the band announced their fifth album via a [[Kickstarter]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1268472090/brand-new-mindless-self-indulgence-record|title=Brand New Mindless Self Indulgence Record!|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|author=Mindless Self Indulgence|date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2012-10-26}}</ref> \'\'[[How I Learned to Stop Giving a Shit and Love Mindless Self Indulgence]]\'\' was released in May 2013, following with the release of singles "It Gets Worse" in December and "Fuck Machine" in January 2014. On January 20, 2014, MSI announced that they would be taking a hiatus from touring after the completion of their 2014 tour.<ref>http://www.hitthescene.net/2014/01/22/mindless-self-indulgence-to-go-on-hiatus/</ref>

==Uppity Cracker==
Uppity Cracker is an [[independent record label]] created by Jimmy Urine and James Galus, which the band has used to distribute numerous promos after their former label refused to distribute releases that featured controversial lyrics (such as the song "Panty Shot"). The label has been used for MSI releases such as \'\'Tight\'\', \'\'Alienating Our Audience\'\', and \'\'Despierta Los Ni\xc3\xb1os\'\', and for releases by the band\'s other project, [[The Left Rights]]. Albums that have been released on other labels also carry the Uppity Cracker imprint. The label\'s only release not related to Mindless Self Indulgence is by New York pop-rap group The O.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

 ****** Brighter Death Now

b'{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}
\'\'\'Brighter Death Now\'\'\' is the artist name under which [[Roger Karmanik]] (b. 1965 as Roger Karlsson), the founder of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] record label [[Cold Meat Industry]], releases [[death industrial]], [[power electronics]] and [[dark ambient]] music.

Whereas early Brighter Death Now recordings tended to be largely instrumental and atmospherically oriented, present-day releases often feature screamed vocals, distorted beyond comprehension. Throughout its history, Karmanik has kept his music\'s thematic elements focused on such topics as child molestation, sadism, and psychosis.[https://soundcloud.com/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/brighter-death-now-innerwar]

The \'\'Great Death\'\' trilogy and \'\'May All Be Dead\'\' have become rare collectors items, and are sought after by many Brighter Death Now fans. Roger Karmanik has been active under other names such as \'\'Lille Roger\'\' (Swedish for Little Roger) and \'\'Bomb The Daynursery\'\'.

In 2009, Karmanik remixed the short films of [[Jason LaRay Keener]] as projection for live shows. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL8369K3ClE watch]

Karmanik closed down Cold Meat Industries around the beginning of 2014 as he expressed that he was suffering mentally and physically from the stress of running the label. By the end of 2014, Karmanik had fully immersed himself within the shroud of Brighter Death Now and announced the creation of his new label Familjegraven whose sole purpose is to release his own projects, including rarities, reissues, and new recordings. Promises Of Death begins with a burst of power electronics might and fury of Swedish / English sloganeering blurting above a vertiginous torrent of thrummed black noise and overwhelming reverberation.

\'\'\'Current 93\'\'\' is an eclectic British [[experimental music]] group, working since the early 1980s in [[folk music|folk]]-based musical forms. The band was founded in 1982<ref>{{cite web|title=Current 93|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6426-current-93/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc.|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Brandon Stosuy|date=11 September 2006}}</ref> by [[David Tibet]] (n\xc3\xa9<!-- n\xc3\xa9e is used for girls; n\xc3\xa9 for boys --> David Michael Bunting, renamed \'Tibet\' by [[Genesis P-Orridge]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Genesis P-Orridge Pays Tribute To Sleazy|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05385-genesis-p-orridge-pays-tribute-to-sleazy|work=The Quietus|publisher=thequietus.com|accessdate=28 January 2014|author=Genesis Breyer P-Orridge|date=November 2010}}</ref> sometime prior to forming the group).

==Background==
Tibet has been the only constant in the group, though [[Steven Stapleton]] (of [[Nurse with Wound]]) has appeared on nearly every Current 93 release.<ref name="93 bio">{{cite web|title=Current 93|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/current-93-mn0000114708|work=All Music|publisher=Rovi Corp|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> [[Michael Cashmore]] has also been a constant contributor since [[Thunder Perfect Mind (Current 93 album)|Thunder Perfect Mind]]. [[Douglas P.]] of [[Death in June]] has played on well over a dozen Current 93 releases, and [[Steve Ignorant]] of [[Crass]] (using the name Stephen Intelligent), [[Boyd Rice]], [[runes|runologist]] [[Freya Aswynn]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Bj\xc3\xb6rk]], [[Andrew W.K.]], [[Will Oldham]], [[Ben Chasny]], [[Rose McDowall]],<ref name="93 bio" />

Current 93 have released over twenty albums and many singles as well.

Much of Current 93\'s early work was similar to late 1970s and early 1980s [[industrial music]]: abrasive [[tape loop]]s, droning synthesizer noises and Tibet\'s distorted, excoriating vocals. 

Tibet\'s lyrics have been fairly consistent, regardless of delivery: The  earlier recordings reflect his preoccupation with death, [[Christ]], [[mysticism]], [[Aleister Crowley]] (Tibet borrowed the term "93 Current" from Crowley \xe2\x80\x93 the 93 Current being the current of [[Thelema]] or [[Agape]]), [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[runes]], [[swastika]]s, [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], \'\'[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]\'\', and a variety of [[occult]] notions. The later to present-day period of Current 93\'s recordings increasingly reflect Tibet\'s interest in [[Christian mysticism]] and [[apocalypse]]. Tibet has stated that he identifies himself as a Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6426-current-93/ |title=Pitchfork: Interviews: Current 93 |publisher=Pitchforkmedia.com |date=11 September 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>

}}

\'\'\'Der Blutharsch\'\'\' is the primary musical project of [[Austria]]n musician [[Albin Julius]].

==History==
Originally a side project to [[The Moon lay hidden beneath a Cloud]], Julius\' first release as Der Blutharsch was a self-titled [[picture disc]] (1996), limited to 250 copies. Early Der Blutharsch recorded material was very [[dark ambient]] in sound, heavy on historic samples and [[post-industrial]] melodic drones. As the discography progressed, the material became more lively, with the more bombastic approach and a focus on a form of [[martial industrial]] with emphasis on neoclassical instrumentation combined with experimentalism. Subject matter and imagery largely derived from historical topics relating to the history of Germanic Europe.

With the release of \'\'Time Is Thee Enemy!\'\' in 2003, Julius took Der Blutharsch into the direction of a [[rock band]]. Gone were the martial aspects of Der Blutharsch, only apparent to some extent in promotional imagery. Instead of a one-man project, promotional material showcased the project as a fleshed out group. Live shows continued in this direction with a focus on placing the group further into the area of [[psychedelic rock]]. Subsequently, any traces of the previous focus on historical themes disappeared with new promotional imagery showcasing references to psychedelic pop art.

==Live==
Live, Der Blutharsch started as a one-man electronic music show. Later, Albin Julius performed as a two or three man show, with martial drumming and spoken (or shouted) lyrics. This can be seen in the \'\'Gold Gab Ich F\xc3\xbcr Eisen\'\' (1999) and \'\'God Blast America!\'\' (filmed 2002, released 2011) videos. Later, Der Blutharsch became a full band, with [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] instruments and female vocal accompaniment. Julius has since enlisted several musicians as "full time" members of the group with the setup of a traditional rock band. In September 2009 they played at the [[Incubate (festival)]] in [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]].

==WKN==
Julius releases all \'\'\'Der Blutharsch\'\'\' material  on his own [[record label]], WKN ([[Wir Kapitulieren Niemals]]). This translates from German to English as \'\'We will never surrender\'\'.

==Symbolism and aesthetics==

===Original logo===
Originally, Der Blutharsch used a logo that was a single [[Sig Rune]] within a triangular shield, reading \'Der Blutharsch\' in the upper portion of the triangle in a [[Fraktur (typeface sub-classification)|Fraktur]] font. This appeared on most early Der Blutharsch vinyl releases and on the original Der Blutharsch website, but was replaced on later pressings by the new logo.

===Current logo===
On later Der Blutharsch releases, the original Sig Rune logo was replaced with an [[iron cross]] embellished with oak leaves. Reissues of old material also excluded the previous logo in favor of the \'new\' logo.

===Controversy===
Julius\' output is often described as [[Neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] owing to his frequent use of military-related themes and fascist aesthetics, including [[Nazism|Third Reich-era]] material, in the composition of his works. Der Blutharsch released 7" split singles with the Italian neo-fascist bands [[Zetazeroalfa]] and [[Sotto Fascia Semplice]] and Austrian [[doom metal ]] band [[Our Survival Depends On Us]], but has also worked with the anarchist industrial band [[Terroritmo]], now called Wakinyan.[http://vinylfroinde.rockoi.com/board/viewtopic.php?p=1190&sid=c1700a44ea0ba0c63489fb04fdb89b96][http://www.zetazeroalfa.org/discografia.html][http://ie.novopress.info/?p=574] In 2004, Der Blutharsch was forced to cancel a performance in Israel after protests from members of the Israeli cabinet and [[Knesset]], the mayor of [[Tel Aviv]], and the [[Anti-Defamation League]].[http://www.shekhovtsov.org/articles/Anton_Shekhovtsov-Apoliteic_Music.html]

}}
\'\'\'Mortiis\'\'\' is a band from [[Notodden]], [[Norway]] fronted by H\xc3\xa5vard Ellefsen, who is also known as the namesake of the band. The name is a misspelling of the word \'mortis\', which is the pronunciation used by the band. Mortiis started as the solo project of Ellefsen as a means to convey a story. This aspect was lost over time and Mortiis slowly formed into a band.

==Band members==

===H\xc3\xa5vard Ellefsen===
H\xc3\xa5vard Ellefsen, often referred to as Mortiis, is the only constant band member.  He was born in [[Skien]], [[Telemark]].  Mortiis began his musical career playing [[bass guitar|bass]] for the [[black metal]] act [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. He stayed with the band just over one year before going on to create his own solo project, though unlike his previous band the music would be [[dark ambient]] oriented. Ellefsen was experimenting greatly with music during his early solo career.  He started four separate projects, though the focus was always on Mortiis.

Ellefsen wrapped up work on the soundtrack to the movie \'\'Broken\'\' and [[The Devil\'s Chair]] (Renegade Films) in 2007. Both films were directed by [[Adam Mason]] who first worked with him on the Mortiis video for \'\'Decadent & Desperate\'\'. Having completed an album\'s worth of songs, Ellefsen commented at how they were "atmospheric and eerie" and also "very dark" while "some of it actually is semi-song structured, with some melody and sense to it."  They were done under the Mortiis name. The collected music will eventually be released as a Mortiis album.

Mortiis as a band was formed shortly after the release of \'\'[[The Smell of Rain]]\'\'.

Dark Dungeon Music was the personal record label of Mortiis. It operated between 1995 and 1999 while Mortiis resided in Halmstad, Sweden, and released mostly limited-edition vinyl. It was dissolved as Mortiis moved back to Norway in late 1999.

===Current line-up===
* Mortiis (H\xc3\xa5vard Ellefsen) - lead vocals, [[Programming (music)|programming]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]
* Levi Gawron (Levi Gawrock Tr\xc3\xb8ite) - lead [[guitar]], [[Programming (music)|programming]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], [[bass guitar|bass]]

==History==

===Era I===
The title of \'\'Era I\'\' was never intentional. It came about in 2001 when Mortiis was set to release \'\'[[The Smell of Rain]]\'\', which was such a departure from his earlier records that he wanted to brand it in a way to signify this. All works previous to \'\'The Smell of Rain\'\' were thereafter referred to as \'\'Era I\'\' as consequence. All of the \'\'Era I\'\' albums were composed entirely on synthesizers, creating a sound that Mortiis described as "dark dungeon music". The last album of this era, \'\'The Stargate\'\', went a step further by introducing a wider range of instruments including acoustic guitars, flutes and dark vocals; mainly provided by [[Sarah Jezebel Deva]].

===Era II===
\'\'[[The Smell of Rain]]\'\' created a divide among fans;{{Who|date=February 2009}} the songs this time had an [[electropop]] feel to them, and frontman Ellefsen took to lead vocals for the first time. This would be the only release under the title of \'\'Era II\'\'. It was during this era that Ellefsen decided he needed to seek members to perform in a live setting, which later helped change how Mortiis as a band sounded.

===Era III===
With \'\'Era III\'\' came \'\'[[The Grudge (album)|The Grudge]]\'\', which took an even more drastic turn from previous eras and is said to have made the biggest impression of any of his albums. \'\'The Grudge\'\' took on a heavy [[industrial rock]] emphasis, combining grinding guitars and industrial programming. Some of the longtime fans were again not too happy with this turn, but it helped gain Mortiis more new fans. In 2005, the Norwegian Culture Council selected \'\'The Grudge\'\' to be freely available for listening to the public in libraries across the country.<ref name="artifact">{{cite news |url=http://www.earache.com/news_stories/mortiis.html#free_cd|publisher=Earache|title=Album made available to public for free |date=April 14, 2005}}</ref>

On April 16, 2007 Mortiis released a remix album titled \'\'[[Some Kind of Heroin]]\'\', reworking material from \'\'The Grudge\'\', via [[Earache Records]]. "Some Kind of Heroin" offers diverse remix material including interpretations by a wide range of contemporaries, such as [[Zombie Girl]], [[Gothminister]], [[Implant (band)|Implant]], [[XP8]], [[PIG (musical project)|PIG]], [[The Kovenant]], [[Velvet Acid Christ]], [[Girls Under Glass]], [[David Wallace]], [[Kubrick]], [[Flesh Field]], [[Dope Stars Inc]], [[In the Nursery]] among others.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=21119_0_2_0_C Mortiis to release remix album]</ref>

\'\'The Great Deceiver\'\' was originally finished in 2008, and includes mixes by Chris Vrenna (NIN, Manson). Additional material has also been finished. In fact, enough material for another album was finished during 2009. Late 2009 and early 2010 earlier music has been partly reprogrammed and re-arranged for future live use.

On 10 October 2010 Mortiis released [[Perfectly Defect]] as a free internet only download album. During this time and the subsequent tours, the visual appearance and sound was similar to that of Era III, but with a more Industrial appearance closer to [[Combichrist]] and without any form of mask which had been a key characteristic of previous eras. Although this is marked as being part of Era III, this could be construed as a movement in Era IV.

===Inactivity===
While Mortiis (as a band or a solo musician) has never stated that the project is on hiatus, last tour ended at P60 in Amstelveen (Netherlands) on July 8, 2011,<ref>Bandsintown. 2011. Online at http://www.bandsintown.com/Mortiis/past_events?page=1 [accessed 3rd August 2014]</ref> with no performance, recording or releases since. However, during this time the mailing list, Instagram account and Facebook page was active, hinting at a return at some point.

==Image==
For nearly the entirety of the bands existence, frontman Ellefsen has altered his facial appearance using several alternatives before using a [[prosthetic]] mask and ear set. The studio who made Mortiis\' mask asked for a character reference for the moulding. The mask was always coupled with ears. During \'\'Era I\'\' the mask covered his whole face, though by \'\'Era III\'\' it had an appearance whereby it seemed to be falling off and was stitched in place. The mask was dropped after the release of \'\'Some Kind of Heroin\'\'. Having stated in an interview that the mask has been shelved "for better or worse", as part of the significance of \'\'Some Kind of Heroin\'\'.<ref>[http://www.earache.com/archive/mortiis/SideLine_Jul07_Mortiis.jpg Interview]</ref>

Ellefsen\'s choice of dreadlocks (sometime after Era I), and various outfits helped produce the "Mortiis image". When asked as to what the mask represents he has answered, "\'\'I do not look upon myself as a goblin, or troll, or elf, or medieval. I am merely Mortiis.\'\'"<ref>Source: [http://www.starvox.net/intview/mortiis.htm StarVox.net Interview]</ref> Mortiis has been known to repair his live clothes by using black tape to seal holes and tears.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} They often cover themselves in corn flour before going on stage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

When talking about the influence for the imagery that his band uses, Ellefsen has commented, "\'\'A lot of people do not get that you can do more than just look like you\'re waiting for a bus. I mean how dull is that? I grew up with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[W.A.S.P.]] and [[Alice Cooper]].\'\'" <ref>Source:[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIyKi472R8Y Studio Pop Interview 2003]</ref>

==Remixes==
Mortiis was credited for a number of remixes, though most are produced solely by Ellefsen.  Most notable for the [[Alfa Matrix]] signed bands, [[Zombie Girl]] (on the album \'\'[[Blood, Brains and Rock \'N\' Roll]]\'\') and also for another female fronted industrial metal act [[I:Scintilla]] who released their album "[[Optics (album)|Optics]]" on the Belgian industrial label [[Alfa Matrix]] holding a bonus disc with a remix by Mortiis beside others by [[Combichrist]], [[Clan Of Xymox]].<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=22825_0_2_0_C I:Scintilla remixed by Mortiis, Combichrist, KMFDM and Clan Of Xymox for new album]</ref>
Mortiis provided remixes also for Italian Industrial Rock/Metal bands like [[Dope Stars Inc.]], [[T3CHN0PH0B1A]], as well as American Ethereal/Neoclassical act [[Melankolia]].<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Melankolia-III/release/3570771]</ref>

\'\'\'SPK\'\'\' were an Australian [[industrial music]] and [[noise music]] group formed in 1978. They were fronted by mainstay member, [[Graeme Revell]] on keyboards and percussion. In 1980 the group travelled to the United Kingdom where they issued their debut album, \'\'[[Information Overload Unit]]\'\'. In 1983 Sinan Leong joined on lead vocals. The group disbanded in 1988, two years later Revell and Leong relocated to the United States, where Revell has worked as a [[Hollywood]] film score composer. According to Australian rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], SPK were "at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes".

==History==
SPK was formed in 1978 in Sydney when New Zealand-born [[Graeme Revell]] (aka "EMS AKS", "Operator", "Oblivion") met Neil Hill (aka "Ne/H/il"). Revell was working as a nurse on a [[psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] at [[Callan Park Hospital for the Insane|Callan Park Hospital]] where Hill was also working.  Hill and Revell shared a house and an interest in the [[manifesto]] of the German radical [[Marxist]] group known as the [[Socialist Patients\' Collective|Sozialistisches Patientenkollektiv]] (SPK).<ref name="Blake"/> The duo were influenced by [[Kraftwerk]], [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Neu!]], [[Faust (band)|Faust]], and [[John Cage]] \xe2\x80\x93 they started playing their own variety of [[industrial music]] as SPK.<ref name="Blake"/> According to rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]] the acronym SPK is variously given as "SoliPsiK, SepPuKu, Surgical Penis Klinik, System Planning Korporation and Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The band recruited two teenagers, Danny Rumour on lead guitar and [[David Virgin]] on bass guitar (both ex-Ugly Mirrors, and went on to form Sekret Sekret), on early recordings by SPK in 1979.<ref name="McFarlane"/> In that year they independently released three 7" pressings: \'\'SoliPsiK\'\' as a three-track extended play in April, "Factory" as a single in August and "Mekano" in November.<ref name="McFarlane"/>

Dominik Guerin (aka "Tone Generator") joined on synthesisers in 1980, and later concentrated on the band\'s visual content. In May they issued an EP, \'\'Meat Processing Section\'\', as Surgical Penis Klinik. Without Hill, SPK relocated to London where Guerin and Revell recorded their debut album, \'\'[[Information Overload Unit]]\'\', in a [[Vauxhall]] [[Squatting|squat]] with the help of Revell\'s brother Ashley Revell (aka "Mr.Clean") and Mike Wilkins (guitar, bass guitar, backing vocals). The album deals with psychotic states and mental retardation. The original 1981 release on Side Effects has a black cover with a small picture of head being operated on, the 1985 version on Normal is blue and pictures a man in a wheelchair and the 1992 CD reissue has System Planning Korporation with the initials SPK highlighted in red.<ref name="Bush"/> McFarlane suggested "the album\'s harsh, thumping sound appealed to fans of [[Throbbing Gristle]] and early [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]]".<ref name="McFarlane"/> In June 1980 they issued the single, "Slogun", with lyrics inspired by the Marxist manifesto: "Kill, Kill, Kill for inner peace / Bomb, Bomb, Bomb for mental health / Therapy through violence!"  Other musicians working with SPK included James Pinker (drums, percussion) and Karel van Bergan (violin, vocals), who toured with them to the United States. In July 1981 in Australia, the M Squared label released another single, "See Saw".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The cover depicts SoliPsiK with members given as Kitka (aka Kit Katalog), Sushi (aka Margaret Hill), Charlyiev (aka [[Paul Charlier]]) and Skorne (Neil Hill). Both tracks are co-written by Charlier and Hill.<ref name="Chambermusik"/>

In 1982 SPK\'s Guerin and Revell were joined by Brian Williams (aka [[Lustmord]]), John Murphy of Forresta di Ferro (aka "Kraang") and [[Hoodlum Priest (musician)|Derek Thompson]] (who later had a brief stint in [[The Cure]] and went on to record as Hoodlum Priest). SPK\'s second album, \'\'[[Leichenschrei]]\'\' (English: \'\'The Scream of the Corpse\'\') (1982), shows Sozialistisches Patienten Kollektiv (English: Socialist Patients\' Collective). After its recording they were joined by Sinan Leong on vocals, who had initially auditioned for a planned SPK side-project, Dance Macabre. Leong and Revell later married. In 1983 Thompson left SPK because Revell "wanted to make a very commercial sounding album which I did not".<ref name="Thompson"/> McFarlane found that "SPK had softened the approach somewhat with discernible synth melodies and dance beats coming to the fore amongst the noise".<ref name="McFarlane"/> In August 1983, the group issued a [[compilation album]], \'\'Auto Da F\xc3\xa9\'\', showing SepPuKu written with SPK in red capital letters.<ref name="Bush3"/> It included three studio tracks recorded in 1981. Bush suggested the album was the "beginning of a more organized approach for SPK material, \'\'Auto Da-F\xc3\xa9\'\' presents an intriguing industrial-disco fusion, reminiscent of prime contemporary material by Cabaret Voltaire and DAF ... Although fans probably thought of [it] as an unconscionable crossover attempt, it\'s still quite experimental in retrospect".<ref name="Bush3"/> The three-track EP, \'\'Dekompositiones\'\' (also by SepPuKu) followed soon after. Its tracks were added to a later version of \'\'Auto Da F\xc3\xa9\'\'.

In early February 1984, just before his 28th birthday, Neil Hill committed suicide.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Two days later his wife Margaret Hill (n\xc3\xa9e Nikitenko) died as a result of complications from anorexia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In March SPK issued another single, "Metal Dance", which was co-written by Revell, Leong and Thompson.<ref name="APRAMetal"/> SPK returned to Australia for a tour and recorded their third album, \'\'[[Machine Age Voodoo]]\'\', in Sydney which was issued in 1984 on [[Warner Music Group|WEA Records]]. For the album, SPK\'s Revell and Leong were joined by Jeff Bartolomei on keyboards, Mary Bradfield-Taylor on vocals, Graham Jesse on saxophone, James Kelly on guitar, Sam McNally on keyboards and Phil Scorgie on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/> McFarlane saw the album as "mixed mainstream disco-pop and sweet vocals with electronic experimentation (sort of like [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] meets Kraftwerk)".<ref name="McFarlane"/> While Bush felt it was "another leap towards dance-rock and away from the group\'s industrial past".<ref name="Bush2"/> The album spawned a single, "Junk Funk" in 1985.<ref name="McFarlane"/>

Leong and Revell returned to Australia and added Karina Hayes as vocalist. They issued \'\'[[Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers]]\'\' in 1986 which provided a single, "In Flagrante Delicto". It was followed by \'\'[[Digitalis Ambigua: Gold & Poison]]\'\' in 1987. Allmusic\'s Sean Carruthers observed that Revell "was in a period of transition... [s]omewhere between the industrial noise of the early years and his later soundtrack work".<ref name="Carruthers"/> In 1988, the band issued a live album, \'\'Oceania... In Performance 1987\'\' but disbanded during the year. In 1989, Revell moved into work on scores and soundtracks.<ref name="McFarlane"/> SPK\'s track "In Flagrante Delicto" was used by Revell for his work on the soundtrack for the 1989 film, \'\'[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]\'\'.<ref name="Survival"/> By 1991 Leong and Revell had moved to Los Angeles.

McFarlane regarded SPK to be "at the forefront of the local post-punk, electronic/experimental movement of the late 1970s ... [their] music progressed from discordant, industrial-strength metal noise to sophisticated and restrained dance-rock with strange attributes".<ref name="McFarlane"/>

==Acronym==
The meaning of the SPK abbreviation is deliberately unclear; the album covers suggest several different alternatives. The most well known is [[Socialist Patients Collective|Sozialistisches PatientenKollektiv]], but there are also others, such as \'\'Surgical Penis Klinik\'\', \'\'System Planning Korporation\'\', \'\'[[Seppuku|SePuKku]]\'\', \'\'Selective Pornography Kontrol\'\', \'\'Special Programming Korps\'\' and \'\'[[Solipsism|SoliPsiK]]\'\'

The most notable recordings of SPK are early: \'\'Information Overload Unit\'\', \'\'Leichenschrei\'\' and \'\'AutoDaFe\'\'. SPK\'s music is best described as disturbing and psychologically disorienting, in line with their [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], [[subversive]] philosophy. Live performances included video backing (some of which was issued in two \'\'Twin Vison\'\' videos, \'\'Despair\'\' and \'\'Two Autopsy Films\'\'), [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] performances with animal carcasses and other attempts to make the audience uncomfortable. The group issued manifestos, such as DoKuments 1 and 2, "The Post-Industrial Strategy", which appeared in [[RE/Search]]\'s \'\'Industrial Culture Handbook\'\'.<ref name="Survival"/><ref name="RESerarch"/> There is a clear dichotomy between early industrial SPK (1978\xe2\x80\x9383) and the more commercial music later favoured by Revell. Later releases, such as \'\'Machine Age Voodoo\'\' (1984), were more [[synthpop]]-oriented than industrial. Still later, the group moved into electronic orchestral work, with the release of \'\'Zamia Lehmanni: Songs of Byzantine Flowers\'\' (1986).

\'\'\'Skinny Puppy\'\'\' is a Canadian [[industrial music]] group, formed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], in 1982. The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the [[electro-industrial]] genre.<ref>Adem Tepedelen, "Skinny Puppy Bark Back", \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\', May 20, 2004. [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/skinnypuppy/articles/story/6056448/skinny_puppy_bark_back] Access date: October 24, 2008.</ref>

Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by [[cEvin Key]] while he was in the new wave band [[Images in Vogue|Images In Vogue]], Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of [[singer|vocalist]] [[Nivek Ogre]]. Over the course of a dozen studio [[album]]s and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included [[Dwayne Goettel]] (1986\xe2\x80\x931995), [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave "Rave" Ogilvie]] (long-time associate, producer, and "unofficial" fourth member until 1995), [[Mark Walk]] (2003\xe2\x80\x93present), and a number of guests, including [[Bill Leeb]] (1985\xe2\x80\x931986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), [[Al Jourgensen]] (1989), and many others.

After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label [[Nettwerk]], anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP \'\'[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]\'\' in 1984 to their 1992 album \'\'[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]\'\', Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated [[cult]] following,<ref name="Chartattack 2001-07-20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans |title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans |accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=[[Chartattack]]|date=2001-07-20|author=Chartattack.com staff}}</ref> fusing elements of [[ambient music|ambient]], [[noise music|noise]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[electro music|electro]], and [[rock music]] and making [[innovative]] use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as [[chemical warfare]] and [[animal testing]].

In 1993, Skinny Puppy left [[Nettwerk]] and long-time producer [[Dave Ogilvie|Rave]], signing with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and relocating to [[Malibu, California]], where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, \'\'[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]\'\'. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a [[heroin]] overdose two months later. The album was completed with [[Dave Rave|Rave]] and released in Goettel\'s memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|a number of other projects]], went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with Mark Walk, they have since released three albums on the German label [[SPV GmbH|Synthetic Symphony]], and toured extensively.

==History==

===Early years and first releases (1982\xe2\x80\x931987)===
{{Listen|filename=Skinny Puppy-Assimilate (1985).ogg|title="Assimilate"|description=Assimilate went on to become one of the most popular Skinny Puppy songs. This track is from \'\'[[Bites (album)|Bites]]\'\'.}}

Skinny Puppy formed in 1982 from the partnership of cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) and Nivek Ogre (Kevin Graham Ogilvie) in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Key was dissatisfied with the pop direction of his then-current band [[Images in Vogue]], and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more raw and experimental. Initially Key had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in [[Images in Vogue|Images In Vogue]], however, when [[Images in Vogue|Images In Vogue]]  relocated to [[Toronto]], Key made Skinny Puppy his full-time project.<ref name="IIV">{{cite web|url=http://imagesinvogue.ca/history.html|title=A Short History|publisher=The Official Images In Vogue Site|accessdate=2006-04-27 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060216221832/imagesinvogue.ca/history.html |archivedate=2006-02-16}}</ref> Key had already created the name of the project and the concept of music from a "dog\'s eye view" when Ogre joined, and it was with this idea that they recorded their first self-released cassette \'\'[[Back & Forth (album)|Back & Forth]]\'\' in 1984, with help from [[Dave "Rave" Ogilvie]]. This was the beginning of a long partnership between Skinny Puppy and Rave, who would serve as their producer until 1993, and again in 1995, and was occasionally listed as a member of the band in album liner notes. \'\'Back & Forth\'\' drew the attention of Vancouver startup label [[Nettwerk]], who signed the band later that year. The first live Skinny Puppy show was at Unovis in Vancouver in February 1984.

The dark electro-pop styles of their debut EP \'\'[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]\'\' in 1984, and first album \'\'[[Bites (album)|Bites]]\'\' at the following year, earned the band a fan base. [[Tom Ellard]] of [[Severed Heads]] lent a hand to the production of the \'\'Bites\'\' track "Assimilate", which became one of the band\'s first underground hits. Other popular songs from this period included "Smothered Hope", "The Choke", "Dead Lines", "Last Call", and "Far Too Frail".

Key and Ogre opened for [[Chris & Cosey]] on their 1985 Canadian tour as [[Bites (album)|Hell \'O\' Death Day]]; some of this material appeared on later Skinny Puppy releases. Bill Leeb, working under the pseudonym [[Bill Leeb|Wilhelm Schroeder]], an early friend of the band, was never listed as a member in album liner notes, but contributed [[bass synth]] to a handful of tracks and was a touring member in 1985. By 1986 he had left the band to form [[Front Line Assembly]]. Dwayne Goettel, who played
[[synthesizer]]s and [[Sampler (signal)|samplers]], joined Skinny Puppy in 1986 (his band, [[Water (band)|Water]], had opened for Skinny Puppy in [[Edmonton]] in 1985). Classically trained as a pianist/keyboardist, Goettel had previously worked with the [[synthpop]] band [[Psyche (band)|Psyche]], among others.<ref name="Remix Magazine interview"/><ref name="SEE Magazine">{{Cite web|url=http://www.seemagazine.com/Issues/2005/0811/mus7.htm|title=Infectious bite|accessdate=2007-05-14|publisher=[[SEE Magazine]]|date=2005-08-11|author=SEE Staff}}</ref>

Their audience expanded with a distribution deal with [[Capitol Records]]/[[EMI]], and [[Play It Again Sam (record label)|Play It Again Sam]] issued a number of their releases in Europe. Their production values improved with the addition of Goettel on \'\'[[Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse]]\'\' in 1986, and \'\'[[Cleanse Fold and Manipulate]]\'\' in the year that followed.<ref name="Remix Magazine interview"/><ref name="AMG bio">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5447/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Skinny Puppy: Biography|author=Jason Ankeny|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> Skinny Puppy performed live in-studio on [[CBC Radio]]\'s \'\'[[Brave New Waves]]\'\' program in September 1986, while \'\'M:TPI\'\'\'s "[[Dig It (Skinny Puppy song)|Dig It]]", the band\'s first single and video, received a fair amount of [[airplay]] on [[Toronto]]\'s [[CFNY-FM]]. Other prominent songs from this period include two singles and one [[extended play|EP]], "[[Addiction (Skinny Puppy song)|Addiction]]" (remixed by [[Adrian Sherwood]]), "[[Chainsaw (Skinny Puppy song)|Chainsaw]]", "[[Stairs and Flowers]]" (12" vinyl; [[United States]] only), along with two other tracks: "Deep Down Trauma Hounds", and "One Time One Place".

Skinny Puppy toured for three years in North America and Europe; a live performance at [[Toronto]]\'s Concert Hall in 1987 was released on [[VHS]] in 1989 and [[CD]] in 1991 as \'\'[[Ain\'t It Dead Yet?]]\'\'.

===Subsequent success (1988\xe2\x80\x931989)===
Over time, the band became outspoken advocates for [[animal rights]], and used the European \'\'Head Trauma\'\' tour and North American \'\'[[VIVIsectVI]]\'\' tour to draw attention to the issue. The title of the album, \'\'[[VIVIsectVI]]\'\', released in 1988, was a pun intended to associate [[vivisection]] with [[Satanism]] (i.e. the "[[Number of the Beast|666]] sect").<ref name="SEE Magazine"/> The album\'s lyrics dealt with criticism of [[pollution]], [[chemical warfare]], [[deforestation]], [[rape]], [[cocaine addiction]], and the promotion of [[sexual abstinence]] to stop the spread of [[AIDS/HIV]]. Lead track "Dogshit" was released as a single in 1988 under the name "[[Censor (single)|Censor]]" (due to censorship issues, radio stations urged the band to change its name for [[radio airplay]]), while the single "[[Testure]]" (which denounced the [[vivisection]] of animals for research purposes) reached No.&nbsp;19 on \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\'\'s [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart in 1989.<ref name="AMG singles chart">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5447/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Skinny Puppy: Charts & Awards: Billboard Singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> A music video was produced for "[[Testure]]", featuring footage of a man being tortured by monstrous-looking surgeons, augmented with clips from \'\'[[The Plague Dogs (film)|The Plague Dogs]]\'\' and \'\'[[Unnecessary Fuss]]\'\', and included a statement denouncing vivisection. Key and Ogre were arrested for "[[disorderly conduct]]" at a 1988 concert in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] after an audience member, believing the [[stuffed animal]] Ogre was "vivisecting" to be a real dog, called the police.<ref>"Skinny Puppy Jailed for Toy Dog Operation." [[The Toronto Star]], October 26, 1988.</ref><ref>"Skinny Puppy U.S. tour going to the dogs." [[The Toronto Star]], November 4, 1988.</ref>

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band members also worked on [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|various side projects]]. Key and Goettel were involved with [[The Tear Garden]] (a collaboration with [[The Legendary Pink Dots]]), [[Doubting Thomas (Canadian band)|Doubting Thomas]] (an outlet for their non-Skinny Puppy instrumentals), and the rock band [[Hilt (band)|Hilt]]. Ogre struck up a friendship with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]\'s [[Al Jourgensen]], and joined [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and some of its side projects on their live tours. For Skinny Puppy\'s fifth album, \'\'[[Rabies (Skinny Puppy album)|Rabies]]\'\', released in 1989, Jourgensen joined Rave as producer. The album, featuring Jourgensen\'s electric guitar work on several tracks, drew mixed reviews, although the singles "[[Tin Omen (single)|Tin Omen]]"  and "[[Worlock (single)|Worlock]]", the latter of which paired a riff sampled from [[The Beatles]]\' "[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]" with a clip of [[Charles Manson]] singing the song, became enduring favorites among many fans. A video produced for "[[Worlock]]", featuring spliced-together footage from dozens of [[horror films]], and a statement denouncing censorship of the genre by the [[MPAA]], was circulated widely as a promotional and bootleg item.<ref name="Official discography"/>

This period marked the beginning of divisions within the band,<ref name="AMG bio"/> as rather than tour in support of \'\'Rabies\'\', Ogre joined [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]\'s \'\'[[The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]\'\' tour as an additional vocalist. Key was later quoted as saying of Ogre\'s involvement with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Martin Atkins]]\' [[Pigface]] during this period that he sometimes felt "like a wife that\'s been cheated on".<ref name="IndustrialnatioN No.&nbsp;5">\'\'[[IndustrialnatioN]]\'\' No.&nbsp;5, 1991.</ref>

===\'\'Too Dark Park\'\' and \'\'Last Rights\'\' (1990\xe2\x80\x931992)===
Their next album, \'\'[[Too Dark Park]]\'\', was released in 1990. The album is built on the harsh electronic rock of previous albums, yielding the singles "[[Tormentor (single)|Tormentor]]"  and "[[Spasmolytic (single)|Spasmolytic]]". Environmental degradation was a major theme on songs such as "Nature\'s Revenge" and "Shore Lined Poison", while layers of background noise grew to a crescendo on the album\'s closer "Reclamation". The North American \'\'[[Too Dark Park]]\'\' tour included the band\'s most graphic backing film to date, featuring everything from [[Budd Dwyer]]\'s televised suicide, to [[animal experimentation]], to [[nerve gas]] attacks in the [[Iran\xe2\x80\x93Iraq War]]. Ogre was restrained in a stage piece called "The Chair of No Cares" and injected with various substances, then prowled the stage on large metal [[stilt]]s. Similar sequences were featured in the "[[Spasmolytic (song)|Spasmolytic]]" music video, directed by [[Jim Van Bebber]].

The album that followed two years later, \'\'[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]\'\', pushed the dark noise of \'\'[[Too Dark Park]]\'\' further into experimental territory. The stage show of its accompanying tour in North America was built around a detailed narrative that involved Ogre interacting with a backing film, a "virtual reality" machine, a bleeding [[crucifix]], and a large, rotating device called "The Tree of No Cares" from which dangled severed heads and pornographic magazines. The 1992 single "[[Inquisition (single)|Inquisition]]" included the b-side "Lahuman8", one of several pieces commissioned by the [[contemporary dance]] group [[La La La Human Steps]] for their 1991 production \'\'Infante C\'est Destroy\'\'. A second single, "[[Love In Vein]]", was never released, although an unfinished remix intended for it later appeared on \'\'[[Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4]]\'\' in 1996. The "Killing Game" video and tour backing film were directed by [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]].

A track titled "Left Handshake" was excluded from \'\'Last Rights\'\', leaving a blank track 10 on some copies of the album. Clearance for a lengthy vocal sample from [[Timothy Leary|Leary]]\'s \'\'[[Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out (Timothy Leary album)|Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out]]\'\', released 25 years prior to the album\'s release, was approved by [[Timothy Leary|Leary]], but denied by the [[copyright]] holder.<ref name="Official discography"/> The song, in which a crazed Ogre responds to [[Timothy Leary|Leary]]\'s instructions for avoiding a "[[bad trip]]", was eventually released on the initial European edition of \'\'Brap\'\' in 1996, and on a limited edition single called "[[Track 10]]" sold at the Skinny Puppy reunion concert in 2000] at Dresden.

===\'\'The Process\'\' and breakup (1993\xe2\x80\x931999)===
Ogre, Key, and Goettel signed a contract with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and moved to [[Malibu, California]], in 1993 to record \'\'[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]\'\', a concept album inspired by 1960s cult [[The Process Church of The Final Judgment]], with [[Roli Mosimann]] producing. The recording sessions were beset by everything from fires to the [[Northridge earthquake]] (this event occurred in early 1994), and [[Roli Mosimann|Mosimann]] was eventually replaced with [[Martin Atkins]]. [[Martin Atkins|Atkins]]\' presence exacerbated the rift that was forming between Ogre on the one hand, and Key and Goettel on the other. The band\'s bickering and excessive drug use made the recording process so long and costly that American reduced Skinny Puppy\'s contract from three albums to one. In 1994, Key and Goettel returned to Vancouver with the master tapes, but Ogre remained in [[Los Angeles]] and quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995. Goettel was found dead of a [[heroin]] overdose in his parents\' home two months later.<ref name="AMG bio"/> \'\'The Process\'\' was eventually completed with [[Dave Ogilvie|Rave]], released in 1996, and dedicated to the memory of Goettel. It was an overall stylistic departure from their previous albums, prominently featuring untreated vocals, guitar, and more accessible song structures. The liner notes that accompanied the [[CD]] included thank-yous to "Electronic Music Lovers" and "Puppy People", followed by the words "The End" in bold type.<ref name="The Process CD liner notes">\'\'[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]\'\', [[CD]] liner notes, Skinny Puppy, American Recordings, 1996.</ref>

During the \'\'[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|Process]]\'\' era, a loose-knit art/philosophy collective also known as [[The Process (collective)|The Process]] was formed, with early contributions from Ogre and [[Genesis P-Orridge]], among others. [[Genesis P-Orridge|P-Orridge]] and [[Larry Thrasher]] of [[Psychic TV]] jammed with Skinny Puppy during this period, a recording of which was eventually released as \'\'[[Puppy Gristle]]\'\' in a limited edition in 2002. These jams partly inspired the creation of the [[Download (band)|Download]] project, which Key and Goettel formed with Mark Spybey and [[Phil Western]] in 1994. Download explored everything from electronic improvisation with spoken vocals to [[minimal techno]] and [[intelligent dance music|IDM]], and toured in 1996. Earlier, in 1993, Goettel and [[Phil Western|Western]] had issued a [[breakbeat hardcore]] single on their own [[Subconscious Records]], and after Goettel\'s death in 1995, Subconscious evolved into a recording studio and record label imprint that Key used to release a number of his own and Skinny Puppy\'s recordings. Key also continued to work with [[The Tear Garden]], produced [[ambient techno]] and [[chill out music]] with [[Phil Western|Western]] in the side project [[PlatEAU (band)|platEAU]], and released his first solo album in 1998.

Ogre had toured extensively with [[Martin Atkins]]\' industrial [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Pigface]] since 1991, and toured with them again in 1995 after leaving Skinny Puppy. He recorded material for his side project [[W.E.L.T.|W.E.L.T]]. with [[Ruby (band)|Ruby]]\'s Mark Walk before quitting Skinny Puppy, but due to legal issues with [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]], this would not see release until 2001 under the new name [[ohGr]]. In the meantime, he guested with [[KMFDM]] in 1997 and 1999, and released an album with [[Martin Atkins]] under the name [[Rx (band)|Rx]] (also known as Ritalin). The [[ohGr]] and [[Rx (band)|Rx]] releases included some of Ogre\'s most pop-oriented songwriting to date. Ogre and Mark Walk also contributed several tracks to the \'\'[[Descent II]]\'\' game soundtrack.
{{Listen|filename=Skinny Puppy-Smothered Hope (Ogre & Mark Walk remix) (1998).ogg|title="Smothered Hope (Ogre & Mark Walk remix)"|description=from \'\'[[remix dystemper]]\'\' (1998)}}

Several collections were released while Skinny Puppy was dormant, including \'\'[[Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4]]\'\' in 1996 and \'\'[[The Singles Collect]]\'\' and \'\'[[B-Sides Collect]]\'\' in 1999. [[Nettwerk]] commissioned a [[remix album]] in 1998; titled \'\'[[remix dystemper]]\'\', it featured classic Skinny Puppy tracks re-worked by a diverse range of artists, including [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]] pioneers [[Autechre]], alt-metal band [[Deftones]], rapper/hip hop producer [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] and Industrial mainstay [[KMFDM]]. Ogre and Mark Walk also took part, contributing a [[breakcore]] remix of "[[Dig It (Skinny Puppy song)|Dig It]]" and an updated version of \'\'[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]\'\'\'s "Smothered Hope" with new vocals by Ogre.

===Reunion, \'\'The Greater Wrong of the Right\'\' and \'\'Mythmaker\'\' (2000\xe2\x80\x932008)===
In 2000, Ogre and Key reunited and performed live as Skinny Puppy for the first time since 1992 at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]]. This unique concert was professionally filmed and recorded, and while a DVD never materialized, live clips of "Testure" and "Worlock" were broadcast on the \'\'Crazy Clip Show\'\' in Germany and "Worlock" was included on a VCD compilation by German magazine \'\'Sonic Seducer\'\' in 2002. The live album \'\'[[Doomsday: Back and Forth Series 5: Live in Dresden]]\'\' was released in 2001.

Key joined [[ohGr]] on drums for its 2001 tour, while Ogre appeared on the track "Frozen Sky" on Key\'s 2001 album \'\'[[The Ghost of Each Room]]\'\'. The first new Skinny Puppy track in several years, "Optimissed", appeared on the [[Underworld (soundtrack)|\'\'Underworld\'\' soundtrack]] in 2003. Ogre, Key, Mark Walk and various guests, including [[Danny Carey]] of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Wayne Static]] of [[Static-X]], recorded the band\'s ninth studio album, \'\'[[The Greater Wrong of the Right]]\'\', released in 2004 on [[Synthetic Symphony]], a sub-label of [[SPV GmbH|SPV]], their European distributor since the mid-1990s. The new Skinny Puppy sound was in a similar vein as \'\'The Process\'\', with a somewhat more rock-oriented style. "Pro-Test", the band\'s first music video since 1996, was rather different than any of their previous video work (featuring a showdown between rival b-boys and goths [[breakdancing]]/[[krumping]] crews on a sidewalk in Los Angeles).

Skinny Puppy toured North America and Europe in support of the album in 2004, joined by [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]] on guitar and [[Justin Bennett]], formerly of [[Professional Murder Music]], on drums. Shows in Toronto and Montreal were filmed for the live DVD \'\'[[Greater Wrong of the Right Live]]\'\', which was released in September 2005. The DVD included \'\'Information Warfare\'\', a documentary about the U.S.-led wars in Iraq made by Morrison. The anti-[[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] stance taken by the band at their live shows drew the ire of [[PABAAH]] (Patriotic Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood), which attempted a boycott of college radio stations that played Skinny Puppy.<ref name="The BG News"/><ref name="PABAAH">{{cite web|url=http://www.pabaah.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=717 |title=Take Action vs College Radio|accessdate=2005-02-17|publisher=[[PABAAH]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050217192430/http://www.pabaah.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=717 |archivedate = 2005-02-17}}</ref> Skinny Puppy toured Europe again in 2005, and returned to the studio to complete their next album, \'\'[[Mythmaker]]\'\', which was released in January 2007. While some fans longed for the sounds of their earlier days, the band stated their intention to move forward rather than dwell in the past,<ref name="Remix Magazine interview"/> and played a mixture of new and old material at their shows, including material from the back catalog that had never been performed live before. The band\'s 2007 North American and European tour, titled \'\'Mythrus\'\', began in May 2007.

Nivek Ogre under Ogre, also appeared in the 2008 dark musical, Repo! The Genetic Opera.

===In Solvent See Tour and \'\'HanDover\'\' (2009\xe2\x80\x932012)===
According to a news posting on the official Skinny Puppy website, the band\'s next studio album was originally slated for release in October 2009,<ref name="Official News Archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.skinnypuppy.com/news.html|title=Skinny Puppy Official Website News Archive|accessdate=2008-07-13|date=2008-04-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615010419/http://www.skinnypuppy.com/news.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-15}}</ref>  but the release of this album has since been delayed due to insolvency issues with the SPV label (thus leading to Ogre naming the 2009 tour the "In Solvent See" tour).

Ogre said in an Interview with the Auxiliary Magazine in June 2013, "There is a very military side to Industrial music, and we are far more in the psychedelic side."<ref>http://www.auxiliarymagazine.com/issue28/AuxiliaryMagazineJune13.pdf</ref>

==Other projects==
{{Main|List of Skinny Puppy side projects}}
Key and Ogre are active in a number of other projects. Key has released several solo albums, and major side projects include [[Doubting Thomas (band)|Doubting Thomas]], [[Download (band)|Download]], [[Plateau (band)|platEAU]], and [[The Tear Garden]]. Key also works as [http://www.scaremeister.com Scaremeister], his film scoring alter ego, having previously contributed to [[John Debney]]\'s score for \'\'[[End of Days (1999 film)|End of Days]]\'\' (1999).

Ogre\'s main project outside Skinny Puppy is [[ohGr]], which released four albums, \'\'[[Welt (album)|Welt]]\'\' (2001), \'\'[[SunnyPsyOp]]\'\' (2003), \'\'[[Devils in my Details]]\'\' (2008), and \'\'[[Undeveloped]]\'\' (2011). Ogre toured with [[KMFDM]] in 1997 and contributed vocals to their albums \'\'[[Symbols (album)|Symbols]]\'\' (1997) and \'\'[[Adios (KMFDM album)|Adios]]\'\' (1999).

"Industrial Revolution: Jackhammer of the Gods". [[Guitar World]], June 1995.</ref> Skinny Puppy experimented with analog and digital recording techniques, composing multi-layered music with [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum machine]]s, acoustic percussion, tape-splices, [[found sound]]s, distortion, samplers, and conventional rock music instruments. They also incorporated samples from films and radio broadcasts into their songs, and applied liberal amounts of distortion and other effects to Ogre\'s vocals, which were often delivered in the [[stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]] style. Lyrical themes included [[animal rights]], [[politics]], [[religion]], [[drug abuse]], [[disease]], and [[environmental degradation]]; these themes were often lyrically and conceptually intertwined. Skinny Puppy\'s often informal, improvisational approach to musical composition is indicated by use of the term \'\'brap\'\', coined by them and defined as a verb meaning "to get together, hook up electronic instruments, get high, and record".<ref>\'\'Brap: Back & Forth vol. 3 & 4\'\', CD liner notes, Skinny Puppy, Nettwerk Productions, 1996.</ref>

Live performances involved periods of [[musical improvisation]], film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines. On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a [[hangman\'s noose]], Key cutting steel with an [[angle grinder]], and [[mock execution]]s of Ogre and [[George H.W.

==Guantanamo Bay Torture Allegations==
Skinny Puppy have accused the US military of using their music to torture inmates at their [[Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detention facility, without the band\'s knowledge or permission. In response, the band have sent an "invoice" to the Pentagon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skinny Puppy Bills Pentagon for Using Its Music at Gitmo|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/skinny-puppy-bills-pentagon-music-gitmo/story?id=22383549|website=ABC News|accessdate=2015-03-13}}</ref>

\'\'\'Fear Factory\'\'\' is an American [[heavy metal music|metal]] band that was formed in 1989. During the band\'s career, it has released eight full-length albums and has evolved through a succession of styles, including [[industrial metal]], [[death metal]], [[groove metal]], and [[thrash metal]].<ref name="ugo">[http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?cat=metal&artist=fearfactory&full=Fear%20Factory www.ugo.com] "Despite the setback of their shoddy first album, Fear Factory tightened its sound and as traditional death metal structures began to fade, they evolved into a popular industrial metal band while also incorporating a groove metal style. However, their sound has become so unique it seems to elude and genre, and arguments continue over the label that should be placed on them. This has also gotten them heard in the mainstream, and many say Fear Factory is a \'stepping stone\' for mainstream listeners to venture deeper into the underground."</ref><ref name="dis">[http://www.drownedinsound.com/bands/491 www.drownedinsound.com] "LA\'s Fear Factory were once named Ulceration. They originally formed in 1990, but when the new decade dawned, it probably occurred to them that Fear Factory was a much better name for a combination of thrash metal, death metal, groove metal, industrial metal, metal metal and probably some other metals."</ref><ref name="em">[http://edmontonmusic.com/bands/fear+factory.html edmontonmusic.com] "\'Ulceration\' was not picked for any real reason other than that Burton C.

In April 2009, a new lineup was announced. Cazares returned as lead and rhythm guitarist, and [[Gene Hoglan]] as drummer. Bell and Stroud reprised their respective roles, and the band completed a seventh studio album titled \'\'[[Mechanize]]\'\'. Former members Christian Olde Wolbers and [[Raymond Herrera]]\xe2\x80\x94both of whom were playing in [[Arkaea]]\xe2\x80\x94disputed the legitimacy of the new lineup, and a legal battle from both parties was begun. Fear Factory released its eighth studio album, \'\'[[The Industrialist]]\'\', in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therockfather.com/blog/item/329-go-buy-the-new-fear-factory-album-its-out-today |title=New Fear Factory Album |publisher=Therockfather.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>

Over the years, Fear Factory has seen changes in its members, with Burton C. Bell being the only consistent member since 1990. The band has performed at three [[Ozzfest]]s and the inaugural [[Gigantour]]. Its singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200. The band has sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==History==

===Early years (1989\xe2\x80\x931990)===
Fear Factory was formed in 1989 under the name \'\'\'Ulceration\'\'\', which the band agreed would "just be a cool name".<ref name="FFF" /> In 1990, the name "Fear Factory" was adopted to reflect the band\'s new [[death metal]] sound, which was influenced by early British [[industrial metal]], [[industrial music]], and [[grindcore]] yet remained rooted in a conservative [[extreme metal]] approach; a facet of the band\'s music that resulted in its wider music audience appeal.

The band\'s origins can be traced to an outfit formed by guitarist [[Dino Cazares]]\xe2\x80\x94formerly of \'\'[[The Douche Lords]]\'\'\xe2\x80\x94and drummer [[Raymond Herrera]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |author= Huey, Steve |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23420/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title= Fear Factory Biography |accessdate= 2007-03-14 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> Their first line-up was completed with the addition of vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] (ex-\'\'Hate Face\'\'<ref name="AMG" />), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheared him singing [[New Year\'s Day (song)|New Year\'s Day]] by [[U2]].<ref name="FFF">{{cite web |author= Hook, James; Maske, Douglas A.; Rhoney, Stephen |url= http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050205232828/http://www.fearfactoryfans.com/bio.php |archivedate= 2005-02-05 |title= Who is Fear Factory? |accessdate= 2007-03-14 |publisher= FearFactoryFans.com}}</ref> Cazares played bass on the first two Fear Factory albums \'\'Concrete\'\', \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' and about 60% on \'\'Demanufacture\'\', on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone, and with only one-and-a-half days for Christian to record the bass, Dino and [[Colin Richardson]] decided that having Cazares playing most of the bass would speed the recording of the album.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Fear Factory\'s earliest demo recordings are strongly reminiscent of the early works of [[Napalm Death]] and [[Godflesh]], an acknowledged influence of the band in the grindcore-driven approach of the former and the mechanical brutality, bleakness, and vocal stylings of the latter. According to Brian Russ of [[The BNR Metal Pages]], the demos are remarkable for integrating these influences into the band\'s death metal sound and for Burton C. Bell\'s pioneering fusion of extreme [[death growl]]s and clean vocals in the same song, which was to become a significant and influential element of the band\'s sound throughout their career.{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}<ref name="BNR" /> The use of grunts and "throat singing" combined with clean vocals later defined the [[nu metal]] and other emerging subgenres of metal. Many vocalists in today\'s metal scene use two or more methods of singing and vocalizing lyrics. The band contributed two songs to the \'\'L.A. Death Metal Compilation\'\' in 1990.<ref name="AMG" /> The band played its first show on October 31, 1990.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===\'\'Concrete\'\' (1991)===
{{Main|Concrete (Fear Factory album)}}

In 1991, Fear Factory recorded  a series of cuts for their debut album with the then-little-known producer [[Ross Robinson]] in [[Blackie Lawless]]\' studio. The band\'s members were unhappy with the terms of their recording contract and caused a delay with the album\'s release. The band retained the rights to the songs, many of which they re-recorded in 1992 with a different producer, Colin Richardson, for inclusion on their debut release \'\'[[Soul of a New Machine]]\'\'. Meanwhile, Ross Robinson obtained the rights to the recording, which he used to promote himself as a producer. The album was officially released in 2002 by [[Roadrunner Records]] under the title \'\'Concrete\'\' after the band\'s breakup. The release was controversial because the album was issued because of the band\'s outstanding contractual obligation and without the approval of every band member.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Fan opinion has been divided as to whether Ross Robinson\'s production properly captured the intricacies of the band\'s sound. The released album favored a straight-up approach and Robinson\'s distinct drum sound. \'\'Concrete\'\' has become an important album for fans of the early Fear Factory sound; it can be seen as a bridge between the band\'s sound on their demo recordings and their debut release, \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\', and a blueprint for later songs and [[b-side]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Based on the \'\'Concrete\'\' recording, [[Max Cavalera]] recommended Fear Factory to the then-death-metal-focused Roadrunner Records label, which offered the band a [[recording contract]].<ref name="FFF" /> While the band signed the contract, it has since become controversial because of Roadrunner\'s treatment of the band during the events surrounding its 2002 breakup. This was reflected in the first album \'\'Archetype\'\' (2004), which was released following the band\'s reformation. The opening song with lyrics by Burton C. Bell, "Slave Labor", was direct about the band\'s feelings on the matter. After working with numerous bassists, [[Andrew Shives]] was hired as a live bassist prior to the release of \'\'Archetype\'\'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===\'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' (1992\xe2\x80\x931994)===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Soul of a New Machine}}

\'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' (1992), which was recorded with producer Colin Richardson, gave the band greater exposure in the music scene. It was considered revolutionary for its industrial death metal sound that combined Bell\'s harsh and melodic vocals, Herrera\'s machine-like battery, the integrated industrial samples and textures and the sharp, down-tuned, rhythmic, death metal riffs of Dino Cazares. Cazares and Herrera wrote all the music. Because the band had no bass player, Cazares played both guitar and bass on the recording.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Due to the extreme nature of the music, the album never reached the level of popularity attained by their later, more accessible works, and remains a cult favorite.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' is considered by many as Fear Factory\'s final work death metal album because with each album, the band\'s style shifted away from the death metal subgenre.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

To promote the album, Fear Factory embarked on extensive U.S. tours with [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Sick Of It All]]. During this period, sampler/keyboardist [[Reynor Diego]] joined the group. An album tour of Europe with [[Brutal Truth]], then [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], and [[Sleep (band)|Sleep]], followed. The following year, they hired [[Front Line Assembly]] member [[Rhys Fulber]] to remix some songs from the album, demonstrating the band\'s willingness to experiment with their music. The results took on a predominantly [[industrial music|industrial]] guise, and were released as the \'\'[[Fear Is the Mindkiller]]\'\' [[Extended play|EP]] (1993). \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' and \'\'Fear is the Mindkiller\'\' were released (2004) as a package in a new re-mastered reissue by Roadrunner Records.

In 1993, Andrew Shives was forced to leave the band.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} In November the same year, the band met Belgian Christian Olde Wolber through [[Evan Seinfeld]] of Biohazard. Wolbers was recruited as Fear Factory\'s permanent bassist.<ref name="FFF" /> Although Christian joined the band immediately, the tight studio deadlines and Cazares\' regular tweaking of the guitar parts on the next album made it difficult for him  to play all the bass parts of the album\'s songs, so Cazares recording the bass for part of the album.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===\'\'Demanufacture\'\' (1995\xe2\x80\x931997)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Demanufacture}}
Fear Factory\'s second album \'\'Demanufacture\'\' (1995), generally considered to be the band\'s defining work, features, in comparison to the overly brutal approach favored in the early recordings, a more industrial metal sound characterized by a mix of rapid fire thrash metal/industrial metal guitar riffs and tight, pulse driven drum beats, roaring (rather than growled, but still aggressive) vocals that made way for melodic singing and powerful bass lines.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The album\'s production is more refined and the integration of atmospheric keyboard parts and industrial textures upon Cazares\' and Herrera\'s precise musicianship made the songs sound clinical, cold and machine-like and gave the band\'s music a futuristic feel than the band\'s previous works. Many fans consider Rhys Fulber\'s involvement with the band integral to this dimension of their sound. There were extensive contributions from Reynor Diego as well; adding key samples, loops and electronic flourishes to the group dynamics.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

\'\'Demanufacture\'\' received much critical acclaim; it was considered a metal classic, awarded the maximum five K\'s rating in the UK\'s \'\'[[Kerrang!]]\'\' rock magazine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It went on to become a fairly successful album; whereas \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' failed to chart anywhere, \'\'Demanufacture\'\' made the Top 10 of the Billboard Heatseekers charts and a video was produced for the song "[[Replica (song)|Replica]]"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The video was featured in the \'\'[[Test Drive 5]]\'\' video game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The song "Zero Signal" was featured on the \'\'[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]\'\' film soundtrack (1995){{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Instrumental versions of \'\'Demanufacture\'\' songs were later used in [[Personal computer|PC]] videogames \'\'[[Carmageddon]]\'\' and \'\'[[Messiah (video game)|Messiah]]\'\'{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

Fear Factory spent the next few years touring with such bands [[Black Sabbath]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Iron Maiden]], and appearing at the 1996 and 1997 [[Ozzfest]]s, and other music festivals.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In May 1997, the band released a new album composed of \'\'Demanufacture\'\' remixes by artists such as DJ Dano or [[Junkie XL]] called \'\'[[Remanufacture - Cloning Technology]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was the band\'s first appearance on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] ;it also appeared on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Roadrunner Records re-released, in a 10th Anniversary single package, \'\'Demanufacture\'\' and \'\'Remanufacture\'\' in 2005, which is similar to that of \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\' (2004). This edition also includes bonus tracks from the [[digipak]] version of \'\'Demanufacture\'\' (1995).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

{{Main|Obsolete (album)}}
Fear Factory\'s third studio album, \'\'Obsolete\'\' (July 1998), was reportedly completed earlier than planned by canceling an appearance at the [[Dynamo Open Air Festival]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

\'\'Obsolete\'\' was similar in sound to \'\'Demanufacture\'\', and introduced the [[progressive metal]] and [[alternative metal]] elements to the band\'s output.<ref name="Obsrev">{{cite web |author= Prato, Greg |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r366131|pure_url=yes}}
 |title= Obsolete Review |accessdate= 2007-03-14 |publisher= Allmusic}}</ref> For the first time, the album featured Christian Olde Wolbers writing and recording full-time with the band. It also featured Cazares\' debut use of 7-string Ibanez guitars tuned to A tuning (A,D,G,C,F,A,D), and paved the way for a lower-tuned sound than previously. The album is also notable for Rhys Fulber\'s increased involvement with the band.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While Fear Factory had explored the theme of "Man versus Machine" in their earlier work, \'\'Obsolete\'\' was their first [[concept album]] that dealt specifically with a literal interpretation of this subject.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It tells a story called \'\'Conception 5\'\', which was written by Bell, that takes place in a future world where mankind is rendered "obsolete" by machines. Its characters include the "[[Edgecrusher]]", "Smasher/Devourer", and the "Securitron" monitoring system. The story is presented in the lyrics booklet in a screenplay format between the individual songs. The printed story parts link the lyrics of the songs together thematically.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

\'\'Obsolete\'\' was released during the alternative metal boom of the late 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It was supported by tours with [[Slayer]] and later, [[Rammstein]], and a headlining spot on the second stage at Ozzfest in 1999 as last-minute replacements for [[Judas Priest]]. \'\'Obsolete\'\' became the band\'s highest selling album, marking the band\'s first entry into the Top 100 on the Billboard charts. The album also spawned singles "[[Descent (song)|Descent]]" and a [[digipak]] bonus track, "[[Cars (song)|Cars]]", a cover of the [[Gary Numan]] song featuring a guest appearance by Numan on the song.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The single made the Mainstream Rock Top 40 in 1999 and was also featured in the video game, [[Test Drive 6]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Numan also performed a spoken-word sample on the album\'s title track.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A video was filmed for the song "[[Resurrection (Fear Factory song)|Resurrection]]". To date, \'\'Obsolete\'\' remains the only Fear Factory album to have achieved gold sales in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===\'\'Digimortal\'\' and demise (2001\xe2\x80\x932002)===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2014}}
{{Main|Digimortal (album)}}

In early 2001, Fear Factory was asked to headline [[SnoCore Tour|SnoCore Rock]]. The success of \'\'Obsolete\'\' and "Cars" was a turning point for the band; Roadrunner Records was now keen on capitalizing on the band\'s sales potential and pressurized the band to record more accessible material for the follow-up album, titled \'\'Digimortal\'\', which was released in 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

\'\'Digimortal\'\' remained consistent with the band\'s lyrical evolution; Bell now sang about man and machine having merged and unable to be separated without causing harm. Musically, the shift to simpler, more radio friendly song structures lost the band some of its extreme metal fans. Fan opinion, however, remains strongly divided between those who view the album as a colossal failure, those who associate it with the nu metal movement, and others who say the sound is the same Fear Factory at its core and praise the merits afforded by the Rhys Fulber production.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

\'\'Digimortal\'\' made the Top 40 on the Billboard album charts, the Top 20 in Canada and the Top 10 of the Australian album charts. The track "[[Linchpin (song)|Linchpin]]" reached the Mainstream Rock Top 40.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A remix of "Invisible Wounds" was included on the \'\'[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]\'\' film soundtrack, and an instrumental digipak bonus track called "Full Metal Contact" was originally written for the video game, \'\'[[Demolition Racer]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A VHS/DVD release called \'\'[[Digital Connectivity]]\'\', which documents each of the four album periods of the band via interviews, live clips, music videos and tour/studio footage, was released in January 2002.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Although \'\'Digimortal\'\' had a successful start, the sales did not reach the levels of \'\'Obsolete\'\' and the band received little tour support. The direction of the album coupled with strong personal differences between some of the band members created a rift that escalated to the point where Bell announced his exit in March 2002. The band disbanded immediately thereafter; its publicists said this was "largely because vocalist Burton C. Bell is tired of playing angry, aggressive music and wants to form a band that\'s more indie-rock-oriented".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In a final collaboration, the group recorded two songs for the video game \'\'[[The Terminator: Dawn of Fate]]\'\' that month.<ref name="shuttingdown">Wiederhorn, Jon [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452793/fear-factory-shutting-down.jhtml Fear Factory Shutting Down] MTV.com (March 7, 2002).

Over time, tensions within the band developed, between the guitarist Dino Cazares and the other members, particularly Bell.

Wolbers and Herrera reunited later in 2002 and laid the foundations for the return of Fear Factory.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Cazares was now permanently out of the band.

Videos were shot for the songs "[[Cyberwaste]]", "[[Archetype]]" and "[[Bite the Hand That Bleeds]]"; the latter featured on the \'\'[[Saw (2003 film)|Saw]]\'\' film soundtrack.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The band performed on further tours with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] in the US and with [[Mnemic]] in Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The new Fear Factory has largely abandoned the direct "Man versus Machine" theme prevalent on earlier releases in favor of subjects such as religion, war, and [[corporatism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

To the surprise of many fans, Fear Factory announced plans to record and release its next full-length album over a very short period of time with mainstream rock producer [[Toby Wright]], who had worked with [[Korn]] and [[Alice in Chains]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This was allegedly due to pressure from Fear Factory\'s new label [[Calvin Records]], which preponed the album\'s release date from four months away to just a month and a half so the band would have a new album to support on the inaugural [[Gigantour]], which they had been invited to participate on by [[Dave Mustaine]].<ref name="Utopia">{{cite web |author= Yates, Rod |url= http://www.utopia.com.au/pages/interviews/interview-fearfactory.php |title= Fear Factory |accessdate= 2007-03-14 |publisher= Utopia Records, Australia}}</ref>

The resulting album, \'\'Transgression\'\', was released on August 22, 2005, in the United Kingdom, and on the following day in North America, almost a year after \'\'Archetype\'\'.

On April 8, 2009, Bell and Cazares announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud on bass and drummer [[Gene Hoglan]] of [[Death (metal band)|Death]], Strapping Young Lad, [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]], and [[Dethklok]]. On April 28, this project was announced to be a new version of Fear Factory without Herrera and Wolbers.<ref name="Blab4">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=118983 | title=FEAR FACTORY Reforms With DINO CAZARES, BURTON C.

In June 2009, Wolbers and Herrera spoke about the issue on the radio program "[[Speed Freaks]]". Herrera said he and Wolbers were still in the band. "[Christian and I] are actually still in Fear Factory&nbsp;...&nbsp;[Burton and Dino] decided to start a new band, and furthermore, they decided to call it Fear Factory. They never communicated with us about it", said Herrera.<ref name="roadrunnerrecords.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=122059|title=FEAR FACTORY Members Embroiled In \'Legal Battle\' Over Band\'s Name|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref>  Herrera also said the four original members\xe2\x80\x94Bell, Cazares, Wolbers, and Herrera\xe2\x80\x94were contractually regarded as Fear Factory Incorporated, and, "it\'s almost like them two against us two, so it\'s kind of a stalemate".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The drummer also said he and Wolbers had written eight songs for the next Fear Factory record, but that a "personal disagreement" had arisen between them and Bell, which left Bell not wanting to continue work with the band.<ref name="roadrunnerrecords.com"/>

Bell and Cazares later spoke about their reasons for excluding Herrera and Wolbers. Cazares said Bell wanted to reunite the classic Fear Factory line-up of himself, Cazares, Herrera, and Wolbers, but that Herrera and Wolbers refused to be part of any reunion with Cazares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/dino_cazares_what_we_are_doing_now_is_traditional_fear_factory_sound.html |title=Dino Cazares: \'What We Are Doing Now Is Traditional Fear Factory Sound\' &#124; Interviews @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> Bell also said he wanted to fire the band\'s manager Christy Priske, who was also Wolbers\' wife, and Herrera and Wolbers refused. Herrera and Wolbers threatened to sign a new record deal without Bell, prompting him to form a new version of Fear Factory without them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124659 |title=FEAR FACTORY\'s BELL Says Management Dispute Led To Split With HERRERA, WOLBERS |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref> In some interviews, Wolbers said Bell had made "growing unacceptable demands", which were declined. He said, "Ray and I wanted what was best for the business and what he [Burton] was trying to change wasn\'t really good for the business. It was only bad for the business, so that\'s why he went into that whole phase of hijacking the name and trying to run with it." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=124077 |title=BURTON C.

During an interview on June 23, 2009, Cazares said he could never have a working relationship with Raymond and Christian again, saying they were too money-driven and criticized the music they recorded on \'\'Archetype\'\' for being too similar to the band\'s earlier output. Despite ongoing issues between the two parties, the new Fear Factory went ahead with the recording process. In late July 2009, a short video shot with a cell telephone showed Cazares recording drum tracks with longtime contributor Rhys Fulber. On November 6, 2009, [[blabbermouth.net]] said a new album, \'\'Mechanize\'\', would be released on February 9, 2010, on [[Candlelight Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=129951|title=FEAR FACTORY Signs With CANDLELIGHT RECORDS|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref> On November 8, 2009, Fear Factory released a track titled "[[Powershifter]]" on YouTube.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfekNwxK0e4 ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> On November 10, 2009, Bell announced the track list for \'\'Mechanize\'\', along with an explanation of each song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130169|title=FEAR FACTORY: \'Mechanize\' Track-By-Track Guide By BURTON C.

In January 2010, Fear Factory played in Australian and New Zealand tour on the Big Day Out tour, playing their first Australian dates since 2005 on January 17 at Parklands Showgrounds on Queensland\'s [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Fear Factory released \'\'Mechanize\'\' on February 5, 2010, and began a U.S. tour titled "Fear Campaign Tour 2010", in late March. In August 2010, the band headlined the [[Brutal Assault]] open air festival in [[Czech Republic]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In September 2010, Fear Factory toured Australia, New Zealand, and Tokyo as the opening act for [[Metallica]]. The New Zealand concerts were in Christchurch, two shows that were brought about by a petition sent to Metallica asking them to visit New Zealand\'s second-largest city.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  After the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]], the South Island concerts were in doubt, but on September 15, 2010, an official announced the CBS Arena had escaped harm and both shows went ahead.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In an interview during the [[70000 Tons of Metal]] cruise, Bell said Fear Factory was planning to write and record a "full-on concept" album, which was due for release in 2012. He said, "We\'re gonna kind of take a break a little bit, but we\'re definitely going into the studio at some point and start writing. We wanna take our time doing it. Personally&nbsp;...&nbsp;\'\'Mechanize\'\', don\'t get me wrong, is a good record\xe2\x80\x94I\'m very proud of it\xe2\x80\x94but it\'s gotta be better than that.

On May 2, 2013, Cazares commented regarding the status of Fear Factory albums \'\'Archetype\'\' and \'\'Transgression\'\', which were recorded without his participation, and the band\'s decision not to play songs from them live, saying "they don\'t count" as Fear Factory albums.<ref name="metalforcesmagazine.com"/> Contradicting this, Fear Factory played the track \'\'Archetype\'\' on its 2013 Australian tour in early July, with minor changes to the song\'s lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|title=FEAR FACTORY Performs Non-DINO CAZARES-Era Song \'Archetype\' In Brisbane; Video Available |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=192110|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref> On August 2, 2013, ex-drummer Hoglan said he left Fear Factory because he was prevented from participating on the album, and only found out about its completion online.<ref>{{cite web|title=GENE HOGLAN Found Out Via BLABBERMOUTH.NET That He Was No Longer Needed By FEAR FACTORY|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=193290|publisher=BlabberMouth}}</ref>

==Influence==
Fear Factory\'s innovative approach towards and hybridization of the genres industrial metal, death metal, and alternative metal has had a lasting impact on metal music ever since the release of their first album in 1992. Fear Factory is noteworthy among contemporaries for its lyrical focus on [[science fiction]], with much of the band\'s music telling a single story spanning several concept albums. The band has been called a "stepping stone",<ref name="UGO">{{cite web |author= Anonymous |url= http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=fearfactory&cat=metal |title= WHY WE LIKE \'EM |accessdate= 2007-03-15 |publisher= UGO.com}}</ref> leading mainstream listeners to venture into less-known, more extreme bands, and are consistently appreciated.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the liner notes of the re-released version of \'\'Soul of a New Machine\'\', [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] vocalist [[Robert Flynn]], Chimaira vocalist [[Mark Hunter (musician)|Mark Hunter]], and [[Spineshank]] guitarist Mike Sarkisyan cited Fear Factory as an influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Robert Flynn said his vocal style was influenced by Burton Bell\'s vocals and Machine Head have been wrongly credited for the vocal style.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Mark Hunter said Chimaira\'s drumming was heavily influenced by Raymond Herrera. Slipknot, Static-X, and [[Coal Chamber]] have also mentioned Fear factory in their liner notes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

\'\'\'Godflesh\'\'\' are a British [[industrial metal]] band from [[Birmingham]], England. They were formed in 1988 by [[Justin Broadrick]] ([[guitar]], [[vocals]] and [[programming (music)|programming]]) and G.C. Green ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and disbanded in 2002. Godflesh\'s innovative music is widely regarded as a foundational influence on industrial metal and [[post-metal]].<ref name=iht/> Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2010.

==History==

===Formation (1982\xe2\x80\x931988)===
In 1982, Green founded \'\'\'[[Fall of Because]]\'\'\' (named after a [[Killing Joke]] song)<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web | url=http://www.godflesh.com/faq.html | title=The Godflesh FAQ | date=31 July 2001 | accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> with [[Paul Neville (musician)|Paul Neville]]. Broadrick, who had been playing guitar as a member of [[Napalm Death]], joined the group in mid-1985 as drummer and vocalist. He left the band in 1987. Broadrick then spent a couple of years (1986\xe2\x80\x931988) as a member of [[Head of David]]. In 1988, he contacted Green about reforming Fall of Because. Justin decided to take over on guitars and they chose to use a drum machine to help out. They also decided to change their name to Godflesh.<ref name="FAQ"/>

===Career trajectory (1989\xe2\x80\x932001)===
Godflesh established a presence in [[underground music]] with releases such as their \'\'[[Godflesh (EP)|self-titled EP]]\'\', \'\'[[Streetcleaner]]\'\' and \'\'[[Pure (Godflesh album)|Pure]]\'\', which demonstrated the effectiveness of [[lo-fi]] production values in heavy music. A brief flirtation with major label [[Columbia Records]] in 1994 for \'\'[[Selfless (album)|Selfless]]\'\' and the \'\'[[Merciless (EP)|Merciless]]\'\' [[Extended play|EP]] saw the duo take on a more high-end production approach. In 1996 Godflesh released \'\'[[Songs of Love and Hate (Godflesh album)|Songs of Love and Hate]]\'\', which featured the drumming of [[Bryan Mantia]] ([[Guns N\' Roses]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]]). The next album, \'\'[[Us and Them (Godflesh album)|Us and Them]]\'\', released in 1999, saw the group experimenting with a more electronic, [[drum and bass]]-oriented sound in which the guitar played a less central role. In 2001 Godflesh released the double album retrospective \'\'[[In All Languages (Godflesh album)|In All Languages]]\'\'. That same year they released an album of new material, \'\'[[Hymns (Godflesh album)|Hymns]]\'\', which featured the precise drumming of new band member Ted Parsons (formerly of [[Swans (band)|Swans]] and [[Prong (band)|Prong]]) and brought the band back to its slow and heavy roots while retaining elements of its experiments with [[electronica]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].

===Dissolution (2002)===
Green left Godflesh in late 2001. The band announced that Green would be replaced by former [[Killing Joke]] and [[Prong (band)|Prong]] bassist [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]]. In the interim, however, Broadrick\'s thirteen-year relationship with his girlfriend dissolved, and Broadrick suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] shortly before departing for a tour of the [[United States]].<ref name="mtv-Godflesh_Breaks_Up">{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn |title=Godflesh Singer Suffers Breakdown, Breaks Up Band |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453723/20020501/story.jhtml |publisher=MTV |format=JHTML |date=2002-05-01 |accessdate=2009-10-20 }}</ref> Broadrick recalls the breakdown as a "real [[Brian Wilson#Reduced production role in the Beach Boys and mental fatigue|Brian Wilson]] moment" and said that he "felt paralyzed by the stress, which had been building for several months, and I literally couldn\'t get out of bed. I was numb and couldn\'t move, so when the car came to pick me up to take me to the airport, I ran and hid at another friend\'s house in Birmingham."<ref name="breakup-1"/>

The canceled tour caused even more problems for Broadrick. Bus companies had been hired; the groups [[High on Fire]] and Halo had been booked to support. And everyone who lost money came after Broadrick. He stated: "I was getting death threats from the bus company in L.A.. I lost close to $35,000, which I did not have at all. I was broke and had to sell my house and pay off all my debt on credit cards. I pretty much did nothing for four months besides drink heavily."<ref name="breakup-1">{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1553090/metal-file-jesu-obituary-animosity-more-news-that-rules/ | title=Metal File: Jesu, Obituary, Animosity & More News That Rules | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=22 February 2007 | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Harris, Chris}}</ref> On a poster promoting [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]]\'s first EP \'\'[[Heart Ache]]\'\', the caption read as follows "Godflesh is dead, long live Jesu."

Broadrick issued a statement about the end of Godflesh:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godflesh.com/articles/statement.html|title=Godflesh Disbands|date=13 May 2002|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>

{{bq|On April 10th 2002, I disbanded Godflesh. This was something I had painfully been pondering since GC Greens\' departure from the band in Oct 2001. Regrettably it took until the day of leaving for a lengthy U.S tour for the realization to finally take its toll on me. Unfortunately the finality of the decision and the responsibilities of making the decision proved too much for me to bear, and I collapsed under the weight. I found that without GC Green, Godflesh is not Godflesh, and him leaving proved to be an omen for me. I also feel that everything we originally intended or even imagined with Godflesh we have done. My only regret has been the hurting of both remaining band members Ted Parsons and Paul Raven, and disappointing those that believe in Godflesh worldwide... In the near future, my new rock project Jesu will surface. So this is by no means the end of my songwriting/guitar/vocalizing. Simply the end of a chapter. Endless gratitude to all those that have believed in and supported Godflesh throughout the 14 year history. You know who you are... Long live the new flesh...}}

===Reunion (2010\xe2\x80\x932013)===
In November 2009, a reunion show was officially announced for the 2010 edition of the [[Hellfest Summer Open Air]] ([[Clisson]], France).

Asked in a February 2010 interview about Godflesh\'s future, Broadrick replied, "Godflesh will not commit to anything but Hellfest currently. I am unsure as to where we will go from there, if we go anywhere at all." He also revealed that the band will not rule out the possibility of new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/godflesh-mainman-doesn-t-rule-out-possibility-of-new-material/|title=Godflesh Mainman Doesn\'t Rule Out Possibility Of New Material|date=2010-02-05|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=2010-02-06}}</ref>

Godflesh played at the 2010 Supersonic Festival in Birmingham, UK on 23 October, co-headlining with Swans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capsule.org.uk/supersonic/2010/page/supersonic-2010|title=SWANS + GODFLESH HEADLINE SUPERSONIC FESTIVAL 2010}}</ref> They appeared at the 2011 edition of the [[Roadburn Festival|Roadburn festival]] at the 013 venue in Tilburg, Holland, where they performed their first album, \'\'Streetcleaner\'\', in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/godflesh-to-perform-entire-streetcleaner-album-at-roadburn-festival/ |title=GODFLESH To Perform Entire \'Streetcleaner\' Album At ROADBURN Festival |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

In December 2010, Broadrick told [[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] magazine that the band is slowly putting together ideas for a new studio album. He explained, "It\'s something we\'re discussing all the time, and I do have bits and pieces of material. But it\'s something we\'d really like to develop. It\'d be quite easy to knock out eight to 10 in-character songs and release it as quickly as possible to capitalize on the popularity of the group, but it would feel entirely wrong. If it\'s another two years until another Godflesh record, so be it. The most important thing is making a record that stands up with the rest of the back catalogue. I do have this in me again, though."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/reunited-godflesh-working-on-new-material/ |title=Reunited GODFLESH Working On New Material |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=4 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref>

In April 2012, Broadrick confirmed in the April/May edition of \'\'[[Rock-a-Rolla]]\'\' magazine that a new album is in the works: "We intend to release a new album, most likely in 2013, and to record it in late 2012. Probably an EP will come before the album. We will be taking our time with this album, we are not taking it \'lightly\'."<ref>\'\'Rock-a-Rolla\'\' Issue 37.

It was their first North American performance in about 17 years.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Godflesh released their first new recording in over 12 years through \'\'[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]\'\' magazine\'s Flexi Series, which is a cover version of [[Slaughter (Canadian band)|Slaughter]]\'s "[[F.O.D. (Fuck of Death)#Godflesh cover|F.O.D. (Fuck of Death)]]". The flexi disc was included in the November 2013 issue of \'\'Decibel\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/godflesh-first-new-recording-in-over-12-years-to-be-made-available-through-decibel-magazine/ |title=GODFLESH: First New Recording In Over 12 Years To Be Made Available Through DECIBEL Magazine |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2013-08-14 |accessdate=2013-08-23}}</ref>

Godflesh played at [[Roadburn Festival]] 2013 in Tilburg, Holland, featuring [[Robert Hampson]] on guitar for part of the set. They performed their album \'\'Pure\'\' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadburn.com/2012/04/godflesh-to-headline-roadburn-festival-2013-performing-pure-in-its-entirety-for-the-first-time-ever/|title=Godflesh To Headline Roadburn Festival 2013; Performing Pure In Its Entirety For The First Time Ever - Roadburn}}</ref>

===\'\'Decline & Fall\'\' EP and \'\'A World Lit Only by Fire\'\' (2014)===
The band announced plans for a new EP, \'\'[[Decline & Fall]]\'\', which was released on 2 June 2014. \'\'[[A World Lit Only by Fire (album)|A World Lit Only by Fire]]\'\' followed on 7 October,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/godflesh-to-release-a-world-lit-only-by-fire-album-in-october-first-song-streaming/|title=GODFLESH To Release \'A World Lit Only By Fire\' Album In October; First Song Streaming|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=5 August 2014|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> with both releases put out on Broadrick\'s Avalanche Records. The EP includes 4 songs and 2 bonus songs on the Japanese edition. Broadrick commented on the musical style on \'\'A World Lit Only by Fire\'\':
{{cquote|It will be [musically] similar to the first two or three [Godflesh albums]. I just think, like we\'re playing these shows, we feel very pure about we\'re doing and honoring the initial intentions with what we originally set out to do. It will definitely sound aggressive and it probably won\'t sound like any of the other records we\'ve made, but it will have the minimalism of the first few records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/05/07/industrial-innovators-godflesh-announce-first-release-in-over-a-decade/|title=Industrial innovators Godflesh announce first release in over a decade|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2014|publisher=[[Fact (UK magazine)|factmag.com]]}}</ref>}} Broadrick also has a signature 8-string guitar coming out, which he used on both releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2014/05/07/news/godflesh-to-release-new-ep-decline-fall-in-june-justin-k-broadrick-unsure-what-djent-is/|title=Godflesh To Release New EP "Decline & Fall" In June, Justin K Broadrick Unsure What Djent Is|publisher=[[ThePRP]]|date=7 May 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014}}</ref>

==Collaborators and side projects==
Several other musicians have recorded and played live with Godflesh. [[Paul Neville (musician)|Paul Neville]] rejoined Broadrick and Green for the \'\'[[Streetcleaner]]\'\' and \'\'[[Slavestate]]\'\' albums. [[Robert Hampson]], former guitarist for [[Loop (band)|Loop]], appeared on \'\'[[Pure (Godflesh album)|Pure]]\'\' and \'\'[[Cold World (EP)|Cold World]]\'\'. (In 1991 Loop released the split 7" single \'\'Loopflesh\'\' covering the Godflesh song "Like Rats" while Godflesh performed Loop\'s "Straight to Your Heart".)

Members of Godflesh have been involved in numerous side projects, allowing them to explore interests in other musical genres, including [[electronica]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[dub music|dub]], [[industrial hip-hop]], and [[digital hardcore]]. Broadrick has collaborated with [[Kevin Martin (British musician)|Kevin Martin]] and [[Alec Empire]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godflesh.com/encyclopedia/ |title=Godflesh A-Z |publisher=Godflesh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> Broadrick\'s other active projects include [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]] and [[Final (band)|Final]].

Godflesh is known for their unique mixture of [[drum machine]] beats with droning, discordant guitar and powerful, intermittent bass. On their earlier albums, the [[rhythm]]s, [[synth]]s, and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] are credited to "Machine" or "Machines". Later, Godflesh made use of human drummers [[Bryan Mantia]] and [[Ted Parsons]]. Their eerie, slow, and repetitive style is commonly described as "apocalyptic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godflesh.com/articles/article2.html |title=Godflesh Interview |publisher=Godflesh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> The Godflesh sound was once described as "\'\'[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]\'\'-era [[The Cure|Cure]] on [[Quaaludes]]".<ref>Thompson 1994, page 44.</ref>

Broadrick\'s vocals are often guttural, making use of something akin to the [[death grunt]] technique, yet they also at times show a softer, more melodic side, as in "I Wasn\'t Born to Follow" from 1992\'s \'\'Pure\'\'. Godflesh lyrics are terse, cryptic, and bleak, often emphasizing [[dualism|duality or opposition]]. [[Paranoia]] and [[martyrdom]] are also common themes in Godflesh\'s music and cover art.

Broadrick has also taken inspiration from [[Leonard Cohen]]; both artists have albums titled \'\'[[Songs of Love and Hate (Leonard Cohen album)|Songs of Love and Hate]]\'\'. In the song "Mothra" (from \'\'Pure\'\'), Godflesh borrows the lyrics "Your pain is no credential here / It\'s just the shadow of my wound" from the song "Avalanche" on the aforementioned Cohen album.<ref name="FAQ"/>

==Cinematic connections==
The image on the front of 1988\'s \'\'[[Godflesh (EP)|Godflesh]]\'\' is a still from the cult 1966 [[John Frankenheimer]] film \'\'[[Seconds (film)|Seconds]]\'\'. The image on the cover of \'\'[[Streetcleaner]]\'\' is a still from the movie \'\'[[Altered States]]\'\', a 1980 horror film by director [[Ken Russell]] in which the film\'s protagonist, played by William Hurt, explores other states of consciousness with the aid of hallucinogens and an isolation chamber. Photos from the insert sleeve for the album are taken from [[David Lynch]]\'s \'\'[[Eraserhead]]\'\' (another major influence cited by Broadrick).<ref name=faq>{{cite web|url=http://www.godflesh.com/ |title=Godflesh-Crumbling Flesh |publisher=Godflesh.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> The cover of [[Merciless (EP)|\'\'Merciless\'\']] is a still from the 1943 experimental film \'\'[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]\'\'.

Godflesh showed the video for "[[Crush My Soul]]" (by [[Andres Serrano]]) to [[Kirk Hammett]] and he loved it. Metallica later used a piece of footage by Serrano for their cover on the album \'\'[[Load (album)|Load]]\'\'. In a later interview with Hammett, he is asked where the band got the idea of the cover. Hammett tells the interviewer that he saw something on television about Andres Serrano and that is how it came about, not giving any credit to Godflesh. Justin says, "There\'s no copyright on Serrano. We\'ll be the first to admit that. But we planted the seed, and unfortunately we\'re not getting the credit, obviously." Hammett once gave Broadrick a custom Fender Stratocaster after his was stolen on tour, and has commended the band by stating that they are the "heaviest band in existence".<ref name=faq>[http://godflesh.com/faq.html/ ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>

After Earache merged with [[Sony]] (Columbia), Godflesh began appearing on soundtracks. In 1995, they appeared on the soundtrack to the movie \'\'[[Hideaway (film)|Hideaway]]\'\'. They also appeared in the movie itself. During one of the club scenes, they are playing onstage in the background, performing the song "Nihil".<ref name="FAQ"/>

\'\'\'Android Lust\'\'\' is the solo project of \'\'\'Shikhee D\xe2\x80\x99iordna\'\'\', that combines elements of rock, electropop, electro-industrial and classical styles into a blend of music that she describes as "electronic and dark."

==History==
Android Lust is just one person and the brainchild of musician Shikhee in the same vein as auteurs like Trent Reznor.

Shikhee D\xe2\x80\x99iordna was born in Bangladesh, but grew up in England and the U.S.A.<ref name=bosphoenix>{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/state/documents/03281518.asp |title=Editor\'s Picks: Goth, not Goth |author=Freedberg, Michael |year=2003 |work=Boston Phoenix October 31 - November 6, 2003 |publisher=Phoenix Media/Communications Group |accessdate=May 23, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605135512/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/events/state/documents/03281518.asp| archivedate= June 5, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  In 1999, she moved to New York City.<ref name=bosphoenix/>

Her initial work was done entirely electronically, and attracted a goth/electropop/electro-industrial following.<ref name=WBM1340mag>{{cite web |url=http://www.1340mag.com/android_lust_interview.htm |title=Android Lust Interview |author=Fisher, Mark |year=2003 |work=1340 Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20030819094545/http://www.1340mag.com/android_lust_interview.htm |archivedate= August 19, 2003}}</ref>

After two independent label releases Shikhee released \'\'The Dividing\'\' on her own in 2002, bringing her to the attention of [[Projekt Records]], who signed her and re-released the album. \'\'Outburn\'\' Magazine calls \'\'The Dividing\'\' "unconventional and adventurous - 10 out of 10" while the \'\'Boston Phoenix\'\' says "The Dividing never misfires; it feels almost - but not quite - slick, its arranging smart, its themes ingenious." \'\'[[Jane magazine|Jane]]\'\' Magazine said "The Dividing is filled with intensely passionate lyrics delivered in low whispers and startling, penetrating screaming."  That album involved more live instrumentation, on the album all performed by Shikhee.  In the supporting tour she was joined by a live drummer and live keyboardist.  She felt that, while dark it was a more optimistic collection than her earlier work, and that her fanbase had become more diversified.<ref name=WBM1340mag/>

Shikhee\'s third full-length album, \'\'Devour, Rise, and Take Flight\'\', was released on February 21, 2006. "Dragonfly," the first single for the album, was released on October 18.  The album featured more live instrumentation than \'\'The Dividing\'\', but embraced a more aggressive electronic sound.  This album also saw some creative collaboration with Christopher Jon, Android Lust\'s live drummer, who co-wrote one track with Shihkee, performed on other tracks and helped mix the album.<ref name=ReGen109>{{cite web |url=http://www.regenmag.com/Interviews-109-Android-Lust.html |title=ReGen Interviews - Android Lust - Divide and Devour |author=Y&uuml;cel, Ilker |date=March 6, 2006 |work=ReGen Magazine |publisher= |accessdate=May 31, 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071110182047/http://www.regenmag.com/Interviews-109-Android-Lust.html |archivedate= November 10, 2007}}</ref> Also in 2006, a video for "Dragonfly," was directed by New York director [[Dan Ouellette]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Android Lust - Dragonfly|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8nIvGEq-vg|publisher=Android Lust|accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

\'\'\'Angelspit\'\'\' is an electronic music band originally from [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], [[Australia]] and currently based in the United States. The band was formed in 2004 by [[vocalist]]s/[[Synthesizer|synthesists]] Destroyx (Amelia Tan) and ZooG (Karl Learmont). The band\'s music combines unique and stylistic elements of horror, punk and electronic music as well as pop and their work contains imagery revolving around medical experiments and grotesque societies. The band is currently based in [[New York City]] and [[London]]. Angelspit has toured with Angel Theory, [[Ayria]], [[Ikon (band)|Ikon]], [[KMFDM]], Tankt and [[The Cr\xc3\xbcxshadows]], and have also shared the stage with bands such as [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[Skinny Puppy]] and [[Front Line Assembly]]. They performed with [[Lords of Acid]] during a 22-date U.S. tour in March 2011 and toured the United States with [[Blood on the Dance Floor (band)|Blood on the Dance Floor]] in October 2011.

==History==
Karl Learmont (ZooG) and Amelia Tan (Destroyx), met on an online [[zine]] forum.  They shared an interest in zines and started the distro Vox Populis in 2002.  They then started making zines for themselves which became the lyrical inspiration for releases to follow. Angelspit was formed in 2004, they self-released their debut EP, \'\'[[Nurse Grenade]]\'\' on 3 October 2004.

The band self-released their debut studio album, \'\'[[Krankhaus]]\'\' on 6 June 2006, and re-released it on 30 January 2007 with a bonus remix album, entitled \'\'Surgically Atoned\'\', and in the US on [[Dancing Ferret|Dancing Ferret Discs]]. The album featured remixes by Combichrist and Ego Likeness. A video for "Vena Cava" was released on 22 August 2007. The band toured Australia, the USA and Europe where they lived in Berlin to record their second studio album, \'\'[[Blood Death Ivory]]\'\'.

The band released their second studio album, \'\'Blood Death Ivory\'\' on 11 June 2008. The album was written and recorded between 2006 and 2008. Again, the band continued to tour the new material around Europe and the USA. They released their debut remix album \'\'[[Black Kingdom Red Kingdom]]\'\' on 15 May 2009. Around this time the band began to produce "Blipverts", short video blogs and tutorials on various topics, including the production of the band\'s third studio album.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Angelspit band photo-july09.jpg|thumb|left|Promotional image for the launch of \'\'Hideous and Perfect\'\']] -->
The band released their third studio album, \'\'[[Hideous and Perfect]]\'\' on 9 September 2009. A video for "Fuck the Revolution" was released on 28 September 2009. They released their second remix album \'\'[[Larva Pupa Tank Coffin]]\'\' on 10 October 2010. \'\'Larva Pupa Tank Coffin\'\' includes 4 brand new Angelspit tracks and remixes by the band themselves as well as other artists. A video for the remix of "Sleep Now" was released on 2 October 2010. They released their third remix album, \'\'[[Carbon Beauty]]\'\' on 8 March 2011. This new remix album contains 3 new tracks as well as 10 remixes of tracks from the \'\'Hideous and Perfect\'\' album. A video for "Toxic Girl" was released on 13 April 2011, and a video for "Like It? Lick It!" was released on 27 July 2011.

On 15 April 2011, Angelspit announced the addition of three new members: guitarist Valerie Gentile (Black Tape for a Blue Girl, The Cr\xc3\xbcxshadows), drummer Chris Kling (Hanzel und Gretyl, Mortiis) and videojammer The Liar. The new line-up of Angelspit released their fourth studio album, \'\'Hello My Name Is\'\' on October 11, 2011. Matt James replaced Chris Kling in early 2012, and former Cr\xc3\xbcxshadows guitarist George Bikos filled in for Valerie Gentile on the band\'s 2012 tour. On 23 March 2014, Angelspit announced DestroyX was taking time off to focus on her other projects and would be re-joining Angelspit on future recordings.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Zoog|title=Destroy X is taking time off\xe2\x80\xa6|url=http://www.angelspit.net/destroy-x-is-taking-time-off/|publisher=Angelspit.net|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=23 March 2014}}</ref>

\'\'\'Celldweller\'\'\' is a [[Detroit, Michigan]]-based musical project created by multi-instrumentalist artist, producer, songwriter, performer, programmer, and remixer [[Klayton]]. Klayton creates a hybrid fusion of digital and organic elements: intricately designed soundscapes that take cues from electronic genres like [[drum and bass]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[dubstep]], woven together with aggressive rock/metal and orchestral elements. Celldweller songs have been featured in many films, movie trailers, television shows and video games.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Biography ==

===Precursors: Circle of Dust and Angeldust, 1997\xe2\x80\x931999===
The name Celldweller was derived from a nickname his mom gave him when he was a teenager, dubbed "Cellar Dweller", as he made all of his music in his parents cellar.<ref name="Origin of the name Celldweller">{{cite web|title=ask_celldweller Ep. 02: Thanks Mom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYqBUZG4rYQ|work=YouTube.com|publisher=Celldweller|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> Klayton had gained a devoted cult following in the mid 90s because of his [[industrial metal]] band [[Circle of Dust]]. He also contributed to the supergroup [[Argyle Park]], using the pseudonyms Dred, Deathwish, and Celldweller. After the dissolution of Circle of Dust, Klayton concurrently released both a posthumous collection of reworked Circle of Dust leftovers titled \'\'[[Disengage (album)|Disengage]]\'\' and an album for a new project, [[Angeldust (industrial band)|Angeldust]], created in conjunction with illusionist [[Criss Angel]].<ref name="carpenoctem">{{cite web

  | year = 1997
  | accessdate = 2009-04-12
}}</ref> Both albums demonstrated Klayton\'s shift away from industrial metal and towards more electronic-modern industrial rock influences, incorporating richer electronic instrumentation and greater emphasis on melody. This change in style was a major step toward the sound that would come to define Celldweller\'s output. Klayton began creating songs for the Celldweller project in 1998/1999<ref name="deliriuminterview">{{cite web

Klayton worked in earnest with producer Grant Mohrman (formerly of [[Leaderdogs for the Blind]]) on the debut \'\'[[Celldweller (album)|Celldweller]]\'\' album, which was slated for release in February 2001.

All the exposure led to over 500,000 song plays on Mp3.com.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} The "Symbiont" remixes became a digital EP six years later.

The self-titled debut album saw release in early 2003 and debuted at No.&nbsp;17 on [[Billboard charts|Billboard\'s]] Internet Sales Chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=celldweller|chart=Internet Albums}} Celldweller ranking at Billboard]</ref> \'\'Celldweller\'\' included a guest appearance by [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] drummer Jarrod Montague.

In 2004, Klayton put together a double disc release called \'\'[[The Beta Cessions]]\'\'. The first disc contained a re-recording of the last Circle of Dust song, "Goodbye", alternate mixes of "Switchback", the Klayton tracks from the initial Celldweller EP, and demo versions of debut \'\'Celldweller\'\' songs. The second disc contained the full debut album in instrumental form, with a few of the instrumentals being slightly edited.<ref name="1340interview">{{cite web

Three rounds of the competition were completed, with compilations of Celldweller remixes being released at the end of each round. In 2008, the Celldweller Remix Competition evolved into the FiXT Remix Competition where fans, remixers, and musicians have the opportunity to remix songs of not only Celldweller but other FiXT Music artists as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In addition to working on \'\'Wish Upon a Blackstar\'\' and \'\'SVH Vol. 02\'\', Celldweller kept busy on other fronts.

\'\'\'Combichrist\'\'\' is an American [[electro-industrial|aggrotech]] band formed in 2003 by [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[Andy LaPlegua]], who also founded the bands [[Icon of Coil]], [[Panzer AG]], \'\'Scandinavian Cock\'\' and \'\'Scandy\'\'. Combichrist is based in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The band consist of only LaPlegua in the studio with [[Joe Letz]], Z_Marr, Abbey Nex, and Eric13 for live performances. Releases by the band have been very successful in terms of sales and charted in top positions for dance and alternative charts worldwide, a few releases have even sold out completely.{{cn|date=January 2013}}

==History==

===Formation===
The first material that LaPlegua wrote for the project was a [[powernoise]]/[[techno]] crossover track \'\'Thanx to my Buddies\'\' under the moniker \'\'D.r.i.v.E\'\' for the Advanced Electronics Vol. 2 compilation.<ref>{{cite web|title=D.r.i.v.E song|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Advanced-Electronics-Vol-2/release/382552|accessdate=26 January 2012}}</ref> The song was later remade into \'\'Like to Thank My Buddies\'\' on Combichrist\'s album [[Everybody Hates You]]. The project\'s name was later changed to \'\'Hudlager\'\' and then finally to Combichrist before the debut album \'\'[[The Joy of Gunz]]\'\' was released on the German record label [[Out of Line]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Name Change|url=http://vampirefreaks.com/content/comment.php?entry=293&t=Interview+with+Combichrist|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>
The band name came from a [[fanzine]] of LaPlegua\'s in the 1990s, with Combichrist being a character in it that was a "punk-rock messiah." The character would go on drug and alcohol fueled rampages, later healing those whom he had beaten.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of the Combichrist Name|url=http://www.twistmagazine.se/inter/combichristen|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

A few years after the band\'s conception, LaPlegua departed Norway for the United States, which is now the current home-base for Combichrist and his other projects Scandy, Panzer AG, and Scandinavian Cock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Confirmation of location|url=http://clatl.com/cribnotes/archives/2010/11/23/atlantas-combichrist-brings-feast-of-industrial-chaos-to-masquerade|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

===Success===

Combichrist\'s first LP \'\'[[The Joy of Gunz]]\'\' was released in 2003. On Halloween of the same year, the  limited edition EP \'\'[[Kiss The Blade]]\'\' was released with 667 pressings which sold out in less than a week.<ref name="metropolis-records.com">{{cite web|title=Combichrist band history from Metropolis Records|url=http://metropolis-records.com/artist/combichrist|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, the second EP, \'\'[[Sex, Drogen Und Industrial]]\'\', spent several weeks at number one in the [[Deutsche Alternative Charts|DAC charts]]. At the same time that \'\'Sex, Drogen Und Industrial\'\' was released, a limited edition of 666 white-vinyl 12" pressings for \'\'[[Blut Royale]]\'\' were produced, and sold out quickly.<ref name="metropolis-records.com"/>

The year 2005 saw the release of \'\'[[Everybody Hates You]]\'\' and it was at this time that LaPlegua began labeling the music as "Techno Body Music" or TBM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy talks Combichrist and the changing soundscape|url=http://www.electrowelt.com/index.php?Itemid=72&catid=1&id=653:exclusive-interview-with-andy-laplegua-combichristpanzer-ag-icon-of-coil-scandy&option=com_content&view=article|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> The band released a song called "This is TBM" on the Out-of-Line compilation \'\'Techno Body Music volume 1\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|title=TBM Compilation|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-This-Is-Techno-Body-Music-Vol-1/release/533127|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> They played this song live during their 2005 shows, adding vocals to it. No vocal version of the instrumental track was ever released, and the lyrics were instead later reworked for the track "Electrohead." After this release, LaPlegua stopped referring to their music as TBM.  Shortly after the release of the album, Army On The Dance Floor producer [[Kourtney Klein]] was added as alternating keyboardist and drummer to the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nitzer-ebb.de/ebbdotcom/interview_2006_kourtneyklein.html | title=Zero Music interviews Kourtney Klein | publisher=Zero Music Magazine | accessdate=29 April 2012 | year=2006}}</ref> 

Their 2006 single, "[[Get Your Body Beat]]," was released to commercial success, debuting in the No. 14 slot for \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'\'s Dance Singles on June 6.<ref>{{cite book|title=Combichrist Debuts at #14|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_A4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=combichrist&hl=en&ei=EU3PTr7oM-Hy0gGpoJEy&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=combichrist&f=false|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> The music video for the single was included on the DVD release of the biopunk film [[The Gene Generation]] with the song also being used in the movie.<ref>{{cite web|title=Combichrist and VNV nation work on Gene Generation|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=14814_0_2_0_C|accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref>  The band embarked on a North American tour with [[KMFDM]] soon after the release of the single.<ref name="metropolis-records.com"/>

\'\'\'Crocodile Shop\'\'\' (later simply \'\'\'Croc Shop\'\'\') is an [[electronic music|electro]]-[[industrial music|industrial]] [[aggrotech]] [[Electronic body music|EBM]] band formed in [[Berlin, Germany]] in 1987 by [[Mick "London" Hale|Mick Hale]] and [[Bobby "Werner" Strete|R. A. Werner]].

==Background==

Crocodile Shop was born after Hale and Werner disintegrated their previous [[new wave music|new wave]] project, "[[Mod Fun]]". They became inspired by the "darker" [[post-punk]] sounds of [[Joy Division]], [[New Order]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Red Lorry Yellow Lorry]] and [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]. According to the band\'s official website, the name "Crocodile Shop" was just something the group entitled a demo tape as a reminder of its contents, and the name stuck.<ref name="Crocodile Shop Bio">[http://www.crocshop.com/index2.html Crocodile Shop Bio]</ref>

Originally a three-piece band (guitar, bass and drums) with drummer John Figlar of [[Lord John]] fame, the group\'s first release was the 1987 EP entitled "Head" which saw limited distribution on the [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]-based Susstones Records. At the time, the group had a strong [[indie rock]] sound which they later came to dislike and called "Head" their version of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry\'s]] "[[With Sympathy]]" which was an overall embarrassment to the band. The following full-length album "Lullaby", produced by [[Chameleons UK]]\'s Dave Fielding, developed their sound further towards gothic and included more dark guitar work. Eventually, the band would slowly abandon the "guitar goth" sound, first replacing their drummer with a [[drum machine]], and finally with the addition of keyboard player V. Markus, (who was influenced by the likes of [[Front 242]], [[Laibach (band)|Laibach]] and [[Nitzer Ebb]]), they turned to an entirely electronic-based outfit. The band followed up with their developing electronic sound by releasing two more vinyl EPs, the Red Lorry Yellow Lorry influenced "Measure By Measure" and "Technological Optimism".<ref>[http://www.metropolis-records.com/artist/croc-shop Croc Shop review on Metropolis]</ref><ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Croc-Shop/e/B003C12CEQ Croc Shop at Amazon.com]</ref>

Crocodile Shop\'s commercial debut finally came in 1993 with the release of the album "Celebrate the Enemy" on Tinman Records. The album, produced by Chris Randall of [[Wax Trax! Records]] and [[Sister Machine Gun]], was a clean blend of the latest electro-sounds and mixed elements of [[trance music|trance]], [[break-beat]], and EBM. An \'\'[[Alternative Press]]\'\' review described the work as "a hard and harsh blend of high energy rock with the melodic aspects of electro and the high angst of industrialism." The album was followed up by the remix EP "Crush Your Enemies" which was also praised on the dance floor.<ref name="Crocodile Shop Bio"/> 

In 1995, Crocodile Shop signed to [[Metropolis Records]] and continued to expand their repertoire releasing the full-length albums "Beneath" in 1996 and "Pain" in 1997. The remix EPs "Metalwerks" and "Soviet" also followed the studio albums. Also released was "Live Action", a 777-copy limited edition live performance recorded in Germany and distributed on SubMission/SPV label.

As the band\'s popularity in the electro-underground grew, Mick Hale began working on other side projects releasing two electro-dub albums under the name \'\'\'Division #9\'\'\', and teaming up with V. Markus as \'\'\'progGREX.iv\'\'\'. The band had also gone on to produce remixes for such artists as [[Collide (band)|Collide]], [[Battery (band)|Battery]], and [[Android Lust]].

After extensive tours over the next few years, in 1999, the band recruited new member Len9 and changed their musical direction once again. With Len9\'s influences and taking advantage of the newest and more affordable synthesizer technology that was out there, the door opened for new possibilities in their sound.<ref>[http://www.aracnet.com/~jester/interview/crocodile.shop-2.interview.html Crocodile Shop eMail interview by Jester]</ref> They released "Everything is Dead and Gone" which was followed in 2000 by "Order + Joy". (The album\'s title is a play off two of the group\'s original influences: New Order and Joy Division). [[Belgium]]\'s \'\'SIDE-LINE\'\' magazine called "Order + Joy" Crocodile Shop\'s "best album ever", hailing it as a return to their earlier and gritter EBM sound. "Order + Joy" was followed by the remix EP "Wrong" which was released on CD and distributed exclusively through the internet and thus was the first time for the band to issue their music online and reach a wider audience.

In 2002, now under the shortened name \'\'\'Croc Shop\'\'\', the band released "World" which, while continuing much of the gritty EBM sound of "Order + Joy", represented another shift in the music style to a cleaner Synth Pop vibe. While the band embarked on another tour they released a remix EP for "World" called "Translated", and again, it saw exclusive distribution over the internet.  The band has since released the 2&nbsp;cd best of called "CS_Sea: Self Extracting Archive" with 37 tracks covering all the releases, it continues to sell well on cdBaby.com.

Today, the band continues to tour, and has shared the stage with such acts as [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[Front 242]], [[Project Pitchfork]], [[Switchblade Symphony]] and [[Rammstein]].

\'\'\'Das Ich\'\'\' is a [[Germany|German]] electronic music group formed in 1989. The group, fronted by [[Stefan Ackermann]] and [[Bruno Kramm]], were one of the prominent founders of and contributors to "[[Neue Deutsche Todeskunst]]" (\'\'New German Death Art\'\') a musical movement in the early 1990s. The German term \'\'das Ich\'\' makes reference to the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] concept [[James Strachey]] translated as "[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]" (\'\'lit.\'\' "The I").

==History==

In 1989, the members of Das Ich founded the [[Danse Macabre (record label)|Danse Macabre]] record label.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/label/Danse+Macabre Label Discogs Entry]</ref>
Their first full-length album, \'\'Die Propheten\'\', was released in [[Germany]] in  1991 and was reissued in the US in 1997, selling over thirty thousand copies.  In 1996, the album \'\'Egodram\'\' saw the group moving towards a more rhythmic, [[industrial dance]]-oriented sound, resulting in the club singles "Kindgott" and "Destillat".  The album was followed by an [[United States|American]] tour in 1996 and 1997.  This was followed by 1998\'s \'\'Morgue\'\', a [[concept album]] based on the work of [[Gottfried Benn]]. 
[[Image:2013 WGT 12 Das Ich.jpg|thumb|Bruno Kramm (2013)]]
In 1999, they released a remix album, [[Re-Laborat]], that included work done by popular [[electro-industrial]] bands.  [[Bruno Kramm]] released his solo spin off [[Coeur (album)|Coeur]] in 2000.

In 2001, Das Ich released the album \'\'Antichrist\'\', which is a critical reflection on world politics. In 2002 the \'\'Best Of Album Relikt\'\' was released.

In 2004, they released the double album Lava, made of:<br />
Lava:Glut: Disc with more instrumental than industrial tracks.<br />
Lava:Asche: Disco with dance versions of song from Lava:Glut.

In 2006, they released an additional dual album:<br />
Cabaret: Disc with circus style songs, like the name implies, and more instrumental.<br />
Variet\xc3\xa9: Disc with remix versions of Cabaret, made by bands like [[Stillste Stund]], Metallsp\xc3\xbcrunde, FabrikC.etc.

In the same year, they released a new DVD, \'\'Panopticum\'\'.
[[Image:2013 WGT 18 Das Ich.jpg|thumb|Stefan Ackermann ([[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] 2013)]]
The band was undergoing a hiatus due to the health problems of the lead singer, [[Stefan Ackermann]].<ref>[http://emiliantha.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/das-ich-frontman-emerges-from-a-brain-hemmorhage-to-resume-his-adored-craziness/ News of Stefan Ackermann\'s Illness]</ref> They had their Comeback at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in 2013.

\'\'\'Dawn of Ashes\'\'\' was an American [[aggrotech]] / [[extreme metal]] band founded in 2000 from Los Angeles, California, United States. The band\xe2\x80\x99s style consisted of horror-based lyrical and visual themes presented through [[industrial metal|industrial]] and [[melodic black metal]] structures. Dawn of Ashes had an evolution which strongly resembled that of contemporary Norwegian music act [[Mortiis]], with three distinct phases of the band. Both acts progressed from a strictly electronic to metal/electronic based musical form.

Kristof Bathory ended Dawn of Ashes in 2014. Kristof Bathory moved on to a new project named Urilia.

The name Dawn of Ashes is an allegorical metaphor meaning "beginning of the end".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2013/05/dawn-of-ashes-kristof-bathory-interview/}}</ref>

==History==

===Early years/dark electronic phase===
Founded in 2000, Dawn of Ashes\' initial concept was the production of horror based dark electronic music, sometimes known as Terror EBM, hellektro or aggrotech, characterised by heavily using samples from horror films. In the intervening five years before the release of \'\'Sacred Fever\'\', Dawn of Ashes would expand to include two new members: Joey-Tekk and Bahemoth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnofashes.com/info.html|accessdate=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040831041836/http://dawnofashes.com/|archivedate=31 August 2004}}</ref> after having several line-up changes that failed to work.

\'\'Sacred Fever\'\', released in 2005 delivered a sample filled terror EBM soundscape that thematically and lyrically would define Dawn of Ashes into the future.

The release of \'\'Sacred Fever\'\' saw DoA signed to German electronic label NoiTekk with US distribution via COP International and Russian distribution handled by Gravitator Records. Subsequent to their signing, DoA released the album \'\'In the Acts of Violence\'\' (2006) continuing the use of samples from horror films to match the dark and aggressive horror themed lyrics.

Early 2007 saw the departure of Joey-Tekk and the addition of female band member Rayne who had worked with Dawn of Ashes on parts of \'\'In The Acts of Violence\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnofashes.com|accessdate=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118095218/http://www.dawnofashes.com/|archivedate=18 January 2007}}</ref> Work progressed on the follow up album and March 3, 2007 saw the first inklings of Dawn of Ashes future logo<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnofashes.com|accessdate=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308081456/http://www.dawnofashes.com/|archivedate=8 March 2007}}</ref> to go with the debut of the release \'\'The Crypt Injection\'\'.

\'\'The Crypt Injection\'\' was significant for being the first album to deliver a music video for the track "Torture Device." Bathory worked closely with Bahemoth on putting the clip together, and this would further define their relationship in years to come with future videos.

During these years Dawn of Ashes also created a number of remixes for several bands including Suicide Commando, Grendel, Regenerator, Neikka RPM, FGFC820, Helalyn Flowers, Retractor and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawnofashes.com/disco.html|accessdate=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118095218/http://www.dawnofashes.com/|archivedate=18 January 2007}}</ref>

===Melodic black metal phase===
In late 2008 Dawn of Ashes announced a new line-up and a new direction for the band\'s music - melodic black metal, via their MySpace page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/dawnofashes|accessdate=26 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227053539/http://www.myspace.com/dawnofashes|archivedate=27 December 2008}}</ref> Bathory had always been a fan of heavier styles of metal music and felt that the time was right to begin producing it under the DoA name. In order to facilitate the new direction of the band, DoA added new blood to its ranks including Abaddon Mauvais, Cyanide, and Orias.

Band members would end up being replaced (much like the early dark electronic years) in 2010, with Rahab and Volkar Kael joining the band for the recording of the release \'\'Genocide Chapters\'\'. Released on the label Metal Blade Records to strong reviews, \'\'Genocide Chapters\'\' was applauded for its fantastic production and by the appreciation for Bathory\'s ability to turn around from an aggrotech act to a melodic death metal band.

Unfortunately, there would be yet another line-up change with Rahab departing for Othuum sometime in 2010, who would tour with the band on the Darkness Reborn Tour alongside headliners Dimmu Borgir, Enslaved and Blood Red Throne. This tour would assist in growing the fan base of Dawn of Ashes, spreading Bathory\'s visions of horror and filth around the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=11847|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

===Industrial/melodic black metal phase===
Prior to their departure from Metal Blade Records, Dawn of Ashes released the EP \'\'Farewell to the Flesh\'\', a release that saw a return of DoA\'s early electronic elements. Shortly following the release saw Othuum and Volkar Kael leave the band over creative differences. There was no rancour in the split, with Othuum and Volker confirming this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/dawnofashesofficial/posts/363706047005944|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> Bathory\'s response saw the confirmation of Rayne staying on as a band member whilst simultaneously announcing a return to sole proprietorship over Dawn of Ashes\' future creative direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/dawnofashesofficial/posts/10150663163668791|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

Dawn of Ashes also took the time to record another music video for the track "Fuck Like You\xe2\x80\x99re in Hell" - again demonstrating Kristof Bathory\'s creative and horrifying vision and once more executed by Bahemoth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://love-it-loud.com/retrospectives/poisoning-the-steps-of-babel-exploring-the-horror-of-dawn-of-ashes/|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

With the addition of a new guitarist Syrus in 2012 and working with industrial music legend [[Chris Vrenna]] producing (who coincidentally also produced tracks for Mortiis), Dawn of Ashes recorded a substantial amount of material culminating in the 2013 release \'\'Anathema\'\' to critical review. Anathema features a "rebuild" of one of DoA\'s older dark electronic tracks "Torture Device, The Final Formula for Torment", and guest vocals from fellow electronic artists Nero Bellum (Psyclon Nine) and Gary Zon (Dismantled).

The release of the album saw the creation of a new music video (featuring Nero Bellum) for the track "Poisoning the Steps of Babel", again executed by Bahemoth<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tradiov.com/la/videos/the-obscenesters-11-18-13/|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> and a tour "The Hellions of Hollywood", with Dawn of Ashes and [[Psyclon Nine]] co-headlining. Touring from late August to early October, including performing at the VampireFreaks event Triton Festival in NYC, the band has returned to LA to record new material.

2013 also saw the beginnings of references to the "Judas Breed", part of the title to the track "Insidious (of the Judas Breed)" from \'\'Anathema\'\'. This title has since gone on to become the name of the collective of Dawn of Ashes fans and is used by Kristof Bathory to address Dawn of Ashes fandom.

Bathory has expressed his satisfaction with \'\'Anathema\'\'\'s sound and has indicated that he would like to continue to reconcile his love for electronic and metal based music into future Dawn of Ashes material.

===Band Break Up===
On December 28, 2013 the band announced via their Facebook, that the "Enter the Vortex" Tour would be the bands final tour, and after the conclusion of the tour, the band would be breaking up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151933243308791&set=a.10151522581918791.1073741829.332020538790&type=1&theater November 2013}}</ref>

On January 4, 2014, Kristof Bathory was interviewed by Radiobuzzd in an event where Kristof cited numerous reasons for the break up of Dawn of Ashes including but not limited to:
* Potential legal complications around himself (the target of individual lawsuits) and the band\'s name;
<ref>{{cite web|title=End of Dawn Of Ashes Special Interview With Kristof Bathory|url=https://soundcloud.com/radiobuzzd/end-of-dawn-of-ashes-special|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>
However Bathory has advised that moving into the future he will continue to produce music alongside Bahemoth and Syrus, although the specific details have yet to be revealed.

Bathory has also advised that the planned album Enter the Vortex, that originally was to go alongside the tour deeming the same name, will also not be going ahead into recording.

As of April 2014, Kristof Bathory advised that the entire Enter the Vortex tour has been cancelled. Dawn of Ashes final shows was at Dark Munich Festival in April, followed by two shows in the US - Los Angeles and New York City.

\'\'\'Die Krupps\'\'\' ({{IPA-de|di\xcb\x90 \xcb\x88k\xca\x81\xca\x8aps}}) is a [[Germany|German]] [[industrial rock]]/[[electronic body music|EBM]] band, formed in 1980 by [[J\xc3\xbcrgen Engler]] and [[Bernward Malaka]] in [[D\xc3\xbcsseldorf]].

==History==

The band\'s name translates as "The Krupps" and comes from the [[Krupp]] dynasty, one of Germany\'s main industrial families before [[World War II]]. In some interviews the band stated that [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti\'s]] 1969 movie \'\'[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]\'\' \xe2\x80\x94 a depiction of the fictitious German industrial dynasty of the Essenbecks \xe2\x80\x94 was the main inspiration.

[[Ralf D\xc3\xb6rper]] who was part of the initial line-up which created the highly acclaimed early recordings "Stahlwerksynfonie" and "Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn" in 1981 left the band in 1982 to found the band [[Propaganda (band)|Propaganda]]. Propaganda became one of the few German bands which were internationally successful in the 80s. 
In 1989 Ralf D\xc3\xb6rper initiated a collaboration with [[Nitzer Ebb]] on an old Die Krupps track (i.e. Machineries of Joy, a cover of Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn) which he produced together with J\xc3\xbcrgen Engler. The chart-success of the record (Billboard-Charts) led to the reactivation of Die Krupps fronted by Engler and D\xc3\xb6rper.

The initial Die Krupps sound throughout the 1980s combined [[synthesizer]]s with metallic [[percussion instrument|percussion]]. Die Krupps were key in the Europe wide progression of Electronic Body Music culminating with the collaboration in 1989 with British band [[Nitzer Ebb]].  In 1992, they began to utilize [[guitar]]s and more sounds derived from [[heavy metal music]], with the release of their album \'\' [[I (Die Krupps album)|I]]\'\' and the [[Extended play|EP]] \'\'Tribute To Metallica\'\', which consisted of covers of [[Metallica]] songs. Combining electronic and metal elements was a pioneering move which led to a number of other bands using the electronic/metal combo as a template in keeping with a deeper industrial sound. The band continued in this vein through the 1990s, releasing \'\'[[II - The Final Option]]\'\' (with a cover influenced by Deep Purple\'s \'\'[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]\'\') in 1993. A more experimental and pensive \'\'[[III - Odyssey of the Mind]] \'\' followed in 1995.  After the release of the heavily metal-influenced album \'\' [[Paradise Now (album)|Paradise Now]]\'\' in 1997, the band disbanded.

J\xc3\xbcrgen Engler founded the project [[DKay.com]] and released two albums in 2000 and 2002.

Die Krupps celebrated their 25th anniversary with appearances in some major European festivals as well as solo appearances in 2005 and 2006. In fall 2007, two greatest-hits albums were released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Die Krupps: "Too Much History - The Electro Years Vol. 1" and "Too Much History - The Metal Years Vol. 2", both in digipak format.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25902_0_2_0_C Die Krupps launch two best of albums]</ref> Both albums were combined as the 2-disc "Too Much History".

The influential back-catalogue of Die Krupps has been remastered and expanded. So far four of their previous albums "Stahlwerksynfonie" "Volle Kraft Voraus", "I" and "Final Option" have been re-released.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=33412_0_2_1_C Die Krupps re-release their classic albums \'Volle Kraft Voraus\' and \'I\' with bonus-material ]</ref>

To celebrate thirty years of "True Work" Die Krupps announced a joint European tour with Nitzer Ebb in spring 2011.

\'\'\'{{lang|de|Feindflug}}\'\'\' (pronounced "Find-fluke"), is a controversial [[Germany|German]] [[electro-industrial]] band founded in 1995. Translated, the name means "attack-raid" or literally "foe-flight" ("flight against the enemy"); it corresponds in military use to the  [[French language|French]]/[[English language|English]] word "[[sortie]]".

== Style and themes ==

Feindflug\'s music is entirely instrumental, a rarity in the modern [[Industrial music|industrial]]/[[Electronic music|electronica]] scene. The only vocals that can be heard are in samples,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20040724122025/http://www.sloth.org/samples-bin/samples/group?entry=Feindflug Feindflug at archive.org]</ref> mostly taken from movies [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in German or excerpts of [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Klaus Kinski]]. The music tends to be on the harsh side, verging on [[power noise]] at times.

Recurring themes and topics are [[Dictatorship|authoritarian regime]]s, the [[Capital punishment|death-penalty]] and [[total war]], especially World War II and the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].

The band has been associated with the German [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] scene by critics in the past due to the themes presented in their music and their album cover graphics. The band-members, who are fully aware of the association, oppose this critique and have stated that their music is intended as a reflection of the issues it describes, not as support. The band\'s motto is \'\'"Use your brain and think about it!"\'\'.

== Career highlights ==
In 1999 the band had their first official performance at the 8th {{lang|de|[[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]]}} music festival in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]].

In 2004 the band was invited to perform at the 13th {{lang|de|[[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]]}} music festival in Leipzig, Germany.

In 2006 the band performed at the 15th {{lang|de|Wave-Gotik-Treffen}} music festival in Leipzig, Germany.

In 2010 the band performed at the E-tropolis music festival in [[Berlin]], Germany.

In 2011 the band performed at the 20th edition of {{lang|de|Wave-Gotik-Treffen}} in Leipzig, Germany and at the 6th edition of Amphi Festival in Cologne.

== Website ==
As of 2006, the band\'s website\'s [[Adobe Flash|flash]] intro features photographs of several German World War 2 scenes, an [[electric chair]] and President [[George W. Bush]] in between their song, {{lang|de|[[Sterbehilfe|B 66883]]}}. [[Sampling (music)|Voice Sample]]s {{lang|de|\xe2\x80\x9eVon hier gibt es kein Entkommen\xe2\x80\x9c}} ("From here, there is no escape") and {{lang|de|\xe2\x80\x9eSchluss damit!\xe2\x80\x9c}} ("Stop it!" or "Stop that!") can be heard along with the band\'s slogan "Use your brain and think about it!" appearing in between.

\'\'\'Flesh Field\'\'\' was an [[electronic music|electronic]] / [[industrial music|industrial]] band formed in 1996 by Ian Ross in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The name Flesh Field is an unofficial term Ian Ross came up with to describe the psychological defense mechanisms of rape victims.

==History==
Rian Miller joined the band in 1997 to contribute female [[vocals]]. In 2004, Rian was replaced by another female vocalist, Wendy Yanko.
In 2005, Flesh Field performed at the [[M\'era Luna Festival]] in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]].  Their 2004 album \'\'Strain\'\' peaked at number 4 on the 2005 [[Deutsche Alternative Charts|DAC]],<ref>[http://charts.trendcharts.de/jahrescharts2005/DAC/top50.html DAC 2005 number 43]</ref> charting for 8 weeks.

In January 2011, Ian Ross pronounced the retirement of Flesh Field as a musical project. Ian went on to further say that he will continue to make music, and that he is considering a new project.  Seven of the instrumentals for "Tyranny of the Majority" were released on the official Flesh Field website mastered along with two additional untitled instrumentals that were cut from the album. Two of the album\'s tracks, "Swarm" and "Forgotten Trauma" can be found on the albums, "Dependence: Next Level Electronics: Volume 2" and "Septic VI" respectively.

\'\'\'Front 242\'\'\' is a Belgian [[electronic music]] group that came into prominence during the 1980s. Pioneering the style they called [[electronic body music]], they were a profound influence on the electronic and industrial music genres.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/front-242-p13004/biography |title=Front 242 |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation===
Front 242 were formed in 1981 in [[Aarschot]], near [[Leuven]], Belgium, by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen, who wanted to create music and graphic design using emerging electronic tools. The first single, "Principles", was released in 1981.<ref name="history">{{cite web| url=http://www.front242.com/site/content/band.asp | title=Band | work=front242.com | accessdate=March 25, 2010}}</ref> The \'\'front\'\' part of the name comes from the idea of an organized popular uprising. Patrick Codenys and [[Jean-Luc De Meyer]] had separately formed a group called Under Viewer at around the same time, and the two duos joined together in 1982. Bressanutti, Codenys and De Meyer took turns on vocals at first, until they settled on De Meyer as the lead vocalist (early recordings with Bressanutti on vocals were subsequently released in 2004). De Meyer came to write most of the lyrics and Valerie Jane Steele also wrote several tracks including "Don\'t Crash". They decided not to use the regular waveform settings on their synthesizers, arguing that creating the waveform for each note was part of the creative process.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Their next single, "U-Men", was released in 1982,<ref name="history"/> followed by the band\'s first album \'\'Geography\'\' that same year.<ref name="history"/> In 1983, Dirk Bergen left the band to pursue graphic design, and [[Richard Jonckheere]], referred to as Richard 23, joined as vocalist.<ref name="history"/>

===Rising popularity===
Front 242 became a popular musical group in Belgium. Their next album, \'\'[[No Comment (Front 242 album)|No Comment]]\'\', released in 1984,<ref name="history"/> was the first to introduce the term [[electronic body music]] in association with their sound. Front 242 signed with the [[Wax Trax|Wax Trax!]] label in 1984, and started their first tour in the United States with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]. This tour led to the creation of [[Revolting Cocks]] by Richard 23, [[Luc Van Acker]], [[Alain Jourgensen]] of Ministry and others.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1987, Front 242 signed with [[Wax Trax! Records]] in the U.S. and [[Red Rhino]] in Europe, and released \'\'Backcatalogue\'\' and \'\'Official Version\'\'.<ref name="history"/>

In 1988, \'\'[[Front by Front]]\'\' was released, and in December of that same year, "[[Headhunter (song)|Headhunter]]" (with a video by [[Anton Corbijn]]),<ref name="history"/> became the band\'s first club hit, reaching #13 on the [[United States|US]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Dance/Club Play Songs]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="billboard singles">{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=front 242|chart=Dance/Club Play Songs}} | title=Front 242 Chart History: Singles | work=billboard.com | publisher=Nielsen Media Inc. | accessdate=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

===1990s===
\'\'[[Tyranny (For You)]]\'\', released in 1991, became the band\'s highest charting album, reaching #95 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]].<ref name="billboard 200"/>  \'\'Tyranny (For You)\'\' was the first album they released under contract with a major corporate label, Sony/Epic,<ref name="history"/> after the widespread popularity of \'\'Front by Front\'\'. Sony/Epic also acquired the rights to the band\'s back catalog from Wax Trax! and issued re-released versions of the albums with new cover art and bonus tracks taken from singles and EPs.<ref name="history"/>

A broader public was exposed to Front 242\'s music in 1992 in the film \'\'[[Single White Female]]\'\', starring [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]].  In the film, obsessed roommate Leigh ties Fonda to a chair but leaves her with the television remote control. In order to attract attention, Fonda tunes in to a music video channel and turns up the volume. The video playing at the time is Front 242\'s "Rhythm Of Time",<ref name=nwdc>{{cite web | url=http://members.fortunecity.com/twins242/front242/interviews/d_phillips.html | title=Front 242 \xe2\x80\x93 Interview | author=Phillips, D. | work=New World Destruction Channel | date=October 1997 | accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> from the album \'\'Tyranny (For You)\'\'. Also in 1992, the television commercials for the film \'\'[[K2 (film)|K2]]\'\' were set to the Front 242 song "Moldavia", from the same album.

In 1992, Bressanutti returned to combining graphic arts with music, taking his lithographs on tour to three U.S. galleries. Bressanutti also composed a solo half-hour atmospheric recording called \'\'Art and Strategy\'\' (or The Art Corporation) to play during viewings of the lithographs, and released it in a limited edition of 1,000 CDs.

Front 242\'s style shifted abruptly with each of their next two albums, released in rapid succession in 1993 on Epic\'s sub-label RRE (originally planned as a double-CD):  \'\'06:21:03:11 UP EVIL\'\' and \'\'05:22:09:12 OFF\'\' (the numbers correspond to letters, spelling "FUCK UP EVIL" and "EVIL OFF"). The band describes the two albums as "based on the duality of good and evil."<ref name="history"/>  However, strains were emerging, with the band members apparently having different artistic views. Despite these tensions, they performed on the main stage of the 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref>{{cite book | author=Garofalo, Reebee | title=Rockin\' Out: Popular Music in the USA | publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall | year=2008 | page=421 | isbn=978-0-13-234305-3}}</ref>

Neither of these albums had significant input from Richard 23, and \'\'05:22:09:12 OFF\'\' only included their lead vocalist, Jean-Luc De Meyer, on a remixed track originally from \'\'Up Evil\'\'. On the other hand, a variety of new contributors were listed as members of Front 242 on these albums: Jean-Marc Pauly and Pierre Pauly (of the Belgian electronic group Parade Ground) on \'\'Up Evil\'\', and 99 Kowalski and Eran Westwood on \'\'Off\'\'.<ref>{{cite book | title=The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll | author=Romanowski, Patricia | year=1995 | publisher=Fireside | isbn=978-0-684-81044-7 }}</ref>

99 Kowalski is the stage name of Kristin Kowalski, making a tradition out of Richard 23\'s idea of number-as-name. Kowalski and Westwood were originally members of a [[New York City]] band called Spill who Bressanutti and Codenys had brought to Belgium to produce their debut album. After the recording sessions fell apart, they contributed to Front 242 on the \'\'Off\'\' release.

After the release of \'\'06:21:03:11 Up Evil\'\' and \'\'05:22:09:12 Off\'\', there was no new material from Front 242 under any lineup. Instead, the band released a stream of live recordings and remixes. However, this period also saw a proliferation of side projects, an inordinate number of which involved De Meyer.

Earlier, Richard 23 played in the [[Revolting Cocks]], and De Meyer had a side project doing vocals for [[Bigod 20]] for their single, "The Bog" in 1990. In 1995, De Meyer met [[Marc Heal]] of [[Cubanate]] at a [[Front Line Assembly]] concert, and the two of them collaborated along with [[Ged Denton]] and Jonathan Sharp, to record as [[Cyber-Tec Project]] for the new (and short-lived) Cyber-Tec record label.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA377&dq=%22richard+23%22+%22up+evil%22#v=onepage&q=%22richard%2023%22%20%22up%20evil%22&f=false | author=Thompson, Dave | title=Alternative Rock | page=377 | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation | year=2000 | accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

After the departure of Sharp and the demise of the Cyber-Tec label, the remaining group continued working under the name [[C-Tec]]. De Meyer also took over as vocalist for [[Birmingham 6 (band)|Birmingham 6]] for their 1996 album \'\'Error of Judgment\'\'. 1996 also saw the debut album \'\'Elemental\'\' from [[Cobalt 60 (band)|Cobalt 60]], which De Meyer formed with [[Dominique Lallement]] and [[Frederic Sebastien]] of [[Reims]], France, members of [[Kriegbereit]]. This was the start of a number of releases from Cobalt 60, which also did the soundtrack for the video game \'\'[[Wing Commander: Prophecy|Wing Commander V]]\'\'.<ref name=nwdc/> Meanwhile, Richard 23 recorded with the groups [[Holy Gang]], and later, [[LaTchak]].

The four core members of Front 242 regrouped in 1998 to compose radically reworked versions of many of their songs, which they then performed on their first tour in five years, appropriately called the Re:Boot tour. They acknowledged the influence of [[The Prodigy]] and their \'\'Fat of the Land\'\' album in crafting the new, more techno style of Re:Boot.

The new tour material was the subject of Front 242\'s new recording contract in the U.S. with [[Metropolis Records]]. Front 242 also indicated at this time that they were recording new material. However, they had little activity after 1998, making occasional appearances in Europe and Mexico, while Codenys recorded under the name [[Gaiden]] with [[Steve Stoll (musician)|Steve Stoll]] in 2001.

===2000s===
2002 saw the beginning of a wave of new material from Bresanutti and Codenys, and then from Front 242. In August 2002 a DVD/CD two-disc set called \'\'Speed Tribe\'\' was released by [[Dance.com]]. The DVD was a collaboration with experimental documentary filmmakers [[Rod Chong]] and [[Sharon Matarazzo]], who filmed the 2001 24 Hour Le Mans. In the video, the racecars, clouds, rain and spectators form an impressionistic visual backdrop for the music.

Several months later, the first release from [[Male or Female]], also known as Morf, a new project for Bresanutti and Codenys along with vocalist Elko Blijweert. In 2002 and 2003, Morf released an album, an E.P., a double album, and a DVD/CD two-disc combo, on the Belgian record label [[Alfa Matrix]], and went on tour through the U.S.

Then, 2002 and 2003 also saw the release of the new material from Front 242 in a decade: the E.P. \'\'Still and Raw\'\' and the album \'\'Pulse\'\', released on XIIIBis Records in Europe and Metropolis in the U.S. These represented another iteration of Front 242\'s explicitly stated goal of reinventing itself. The style of the two new releases is more mellow than some of their past work, using more "glitchy" and "bleepy" sounds. As well, it uses the manipulated voice as a musical instrument. The new releases have a much more emotional style from De Meyer, which was presaged in his later recordings with [[C-Tec]] and particularly [[Cobalt 60]] on its album \'\'Twelve\'\'.

Front 242 promised a new U.S. tour to perform new material from these releases. They have made occasional appearances in Latin America and Europe, even being rejoined by Dirk Bergen for a reunion concert in Aarschot (De Klinker club) in 2004 under the original lineup of Bresanutti, Bergen, Codenys and De Meyer. This performance was kept secret until two days before the show but when the scene magazine [[Side-Line]] and the band\'s label [[Alfa Matrix]] launched the news, tickets were quickly sold out.

The band has now also set itself to re-release its entire back catalogue both as a normal CD and as a limited edition consisting of a 2-CD set holding previously unreleased material. For this the band is working together with the Belgian label [[Alfa Matrix]] that already took care of releasing the albums of the Front 242 side-project Male Or Female. The first re-release is their debut album \'\'Geography\'\', this time newly remastered personally by Bresanutti to surprisingly powerful effect and including 3 extra tracks (two hidden ones) on the normal CD format.

Meanwhile their enthusiasm for side projects has continued, as Patrick Codenys started appearing with a new group called [[Red Sniper]], Bresanutti started recording with a new group called Troissoeur, and Codenys and Richard 23 formed a quasi-DJ project called [[Coder23]] which toured in late 2004 and early 2005 as the opening act for [[VNV Nation]]. Jean-Luc De Meyer contributed vocals on two studio tracks for the [[Glis]] album \'\'Nemesis\'\' in 2005. The lyrical content of the two songs ("The Irreparable" and "La B\xc3\xa9atrice") were based on the poems of [[Charles Baudelaire]].

Front 242 toured through twenty venues in North America in November 2005, their first tour as a full band since 2000. The band performed at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in 2006. The band\'s sold out two-day performance at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels has been recorded for a future release via [[Alfa Matrix]].

In December 2006, Front 242 announced from their MySpace page that they were writing music for a video game called \'\'[[Cipher Complex]]\'\' and provided a link to a teaser trailer with a short sample of one of their scores.

In 2007 Jean-Luc Demeyer announced a new project: [[32CRASH]] via the Alfa Matrix label. The band is preparing for an album release in October 2007 after the release of the EP \'\'Humanity\'\'.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25639_0_2_0_C 32CRASH announces pre-sales debut album]</ref>

In August 2008, Front 242 played live at the [[Infest (festival)|Infest Festival]] in Bradford, England.

In October 2008 Front 242 performed for the first time in Finland, at the [[Alternative Party|Alternative Party 2008]] media arts festival.

===Moments===
On June 1, 2008, the Alfa Matrix label announced that Front 242 would make an ultimate statement towards abusive audio compression by releasing the free two-track download, \'\'First Moment\'\'. By June 15 the same year, the tracks were made available for free on Alfa Matrix\'s site in medium and high bit-rate [[MP3]]s, [[WAV]], [[FLAC]], and [[M4A]] formats.<ref>[http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1524_0_8_0_C FRONT 242 \xe2\x80\x93 "First moment" free 2-track download]</ref> Contrary to what fans and some media speculated, the two-track download was not new studio material. Instead, \'\'First Moments\'\' consisted of two previously unreleased live tracks, "U-Men" and "Im Rhythmus Bleiben", in rather stunning sound quality. It is rumored that over 20,000 people downloaded the tracks within hours of being made available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The label later confirmed that over 25,000 people downloaded the free tracks.

On June 4, 2008, Alfa Matrix announced the release of \'\'Moments...\'\' The album was a live recording encompassing the best of Front 242\'s compositions. The album was shipped in several formats including limited CD box sets, vinyl in different colors including 300-copy limited editions, and as a one-disc CD release.<ref>[http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1545_0_8_0_C FRONT 242 \xe2\x80\x93 "Moments..." digipak CD + Limited 2CD Carton Box + "Kommando" T-shirt]</ref>

\'\'\'Front Line Assembly\'\'\' (\'\'\'FLA\'\'\') is a Canadian [[electro-industrial]] band formed by [[Bill Leeb]] in [[1986 in music|1986]] after leaving [[Skinny Puppy]]. Influenced by early electronic and ([[Post-industrial music|post]]-)[[industrial music|industrial]] acts such as [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Portion Control (band)|Portion Control]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]], [[Test Dept]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], and [[Severed Heads]],<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview">{{cite journal | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=473 | title=Front Line Assembly | last=Armstrong | first=Emily | publisher=Lively Arts | year=1987 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120402034837/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=473 | archivedate=April 2, 2012 | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> FLA has developed its own unique sound while combining elements of [[electronic body music]] (EBM). The band\'s membership has rotated through several members over the years, including [[Rhys Fulber]] and Michael Balch who are both associated with several other successful artists.

==History==

===Formation (1985\xe2\x80\x931986)===
Between [[1985 in music|1985]] and [[1986 in music|1986]], Bill Leeb supported [[Skinny Puppy]] under the name Wilhelm Schroeder. Wilhelm is Leeb\'s real first name while Schroeder stems from the [[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Peanuts character of the same name]] and was meant as a joke. Leeb later recounted how [[cEvin Key]] came up with the idea: "Kevin said, \'Hey, you should call yourself Wilhelm Schroeder,\' because it was cEvin Key and Nivek Ogre, those weren\'t their real names. That was more of a joke thing."<ref name="eklectiqueinterview">{{cite web | url=http://www.darkwaver.com/eklectique/two/frontline.html | title=Front Line Assembly | publisher=Eklectique Magazine | last=Porter | first=Alicia | date=November 8, 1998 | accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> As an early friend of the band Leeb started off with no knowledge about electronic instruments, according to cEvin Key: "When I first met Bill, [...] he did not play any instruments. I remember going to get his first Moog for $300. It was around the time of \'[[Chainsaw (Skinny Puppy song)|Cage]]\', because we wrote that one together right away."<ref name="barcodeinterviewkey">{{cite web |url=http://www.barcodezine.com/Cevin%20Key%20Interview.htm |title=cEvin Key interview |date=2003 |publisher=Barcode |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> While increasing his knowledge, Leeb considered learning from scratch an advantage. "I think the fact that we didn\'t have any musical training, gave us free range", he said, "The words \'experimental electronic music\' really come to mind as to how we did that."<ref name="phoenixnewtimesinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2011-06-02/music/front-line-assembly-leads-cyborg-armies-through-post-apocalyptic-soundscapes/full/ |title=Front Line Assembly Leads Cyborg Armies Through Post-Apocalyptic Soundscapes |last=Raven |first=Daniel |date=June 2, 2011 |publisher=Phoenix New Times | accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> Leeb contributed [[bass synth]] and backing vocals for several tracks while also supporting their 1985 tour.<ref name="joeradiointerview1988">{{cite web | url=http://www.darkdb.com/eklein/intervw/fla1.html | title=Interview: Front Line Assembly | last=Radio | first=Joe | date=April 24, 1988 | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> His drug experiences at the time, though Leeb felt no need to repeat it at later times, added to his creativity. "You can always draw from that experience of when you were there and what the ambiance and the feeling was like. It\'s not like you need to go there every year to recapture that moment.", Leeb stated.<ref name="phoenixnewtimesinterview" /> Since Leeb did not want to continue with the next tour, splitting up with Skinny Puppy was imminent. "In early 1986, Bill didn\'t want to tour again", said cEvin Key, "so I politely told him that we needed to get someone more dedicated."<ref name="barcodeinterviewkey" /> Leeb and Skinny Puppy did not separate in a fight, though, as Key stressed, "It wasn\'t so negative. We actually went on to make an LP a few years later, and we have been polite to each other since."<ref name="barcodeinterviewkey" />

Leeb reflects on this period, "[[Skinny Puppy]] was a good starting point for me, but there was definitely no way for me to get my ideas across."<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview" /> Also, Leeb wanted to take an active role as vocalist.<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93">{{cite web | url=http://www.chaoscontrol.com/front-line-assembly-3/ | title=Front Line Assembly | publisher=Chaos Control Magazine | date=1993 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref> His experiences working with [[Skinny Puppy]] gave him some insight in the industry and helped shape his ideas for his own personal career.<ref name="mphistory">{{cite web | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/archive/history/ | title=History | publisher=Mindphaser.com | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> Contacts in the music scene he had gathered while with Skinny Puppy facilitated the advancement of his own project, leading to contract offers from the first two labels that Leeb later approached with cassettes.<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93" /> Leeb appreciated that Skinny Puppy would cast a long shadow over his own musical efforts after leaving the band. "Sometimes, you break away from a band, and the band has such a strong image that you\'re always going to be forever compared to those guys," Leeb said, "I knew it was a big risk because the band was already taking off and stuff, but I think it was all for the best."<ref name="phoenixnewtimesinterview" />

The name of his new band reflects Leebs view of the world at the time. "The name came to me from just hearing people\'s struggles all over the world on the news all the time", he revealed after the formation of Front Line Assembly, "The only way people can fight back is to assemble in groups. We are fed so much information through the media that no one knows what to believe anymore. So Front Line Assembly means fighting the communications war."<ref name="mplivelyartsinterview" />

Upon the formation of Front Line Assembly, Leeb produced the \'\'[[Nerve War]]\'\' demo tape which was distributed on a limited basis. Around this time, Leeb and Rhys Fulber became friends when they discovered they both had a similar interest in underground music. "He was playing cool underground tapes that I liked. Not many people then were into that kind of music", recalls Fulber.<ref name="mpfulberbio">{{cite web | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=13 | title=Rhys Fulber > Biography | publisher=Mindphaser.com | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120510005653/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=13 | archivedate=May 10, 2012 | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> As an unofficial member at this time, Fulber partnered with Leeb during the production of \'\'[[Total Terror]]\'\' and was credited for the song "Black Fluid" on the demo.<ref name="mpfulberbio" /> Both demo releases were limited to 100 and mostly distributed amongst friends.<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" />

===Early releases and working with Balch (1987\xe2\x80\x931989)===
The first appearance of Front Line Assembly was on the compilation \'\'For Your Ears Only\'\', released in 1987 by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[independent record label]] [[Third Mind Records|Third Mind]]<ref name="reclamationbooklet">{{cite AV media notes |title=Front Line Assembly - Reclamation |others=Front Line Assembly |year=1997 |pages=2\xe2\x80\x933 |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] |last=Levermore |first=Gary |type=booklet |location=[[New York City|New York]]}}</ref> showcasing the label\'s repertoire at the time. The band contributed the track "Aggression"<ref name="darkdbcomp">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkdb.com/eklein/comp/compf.html#278 | title=Compilations F |last=Klein |first=Ed |publisher=Ed Klein |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> which would be re-released the following year on the \'\'[[Disorder (EP)|Disorder]]\'\' EP. Although the contact to Third Mind would later develop into a long-standing collaboration between Front Line Assembly and the label, the band debuted its first album \'\'[[The Initial Command]]\'\' with credited assistance by Fulber and Michael Balch on [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[independent record label]] [[KK Records|KK]] at the end of 1987. The album had been produced on a tight budget which would determine whether or not cuts would be done with an eight track system or split into two four track cuts.<ref name="interviewaltpress">{{cite journal | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=472 | title=Interview with Bill Leeb | publisher=Alternative Press | last=Shea | first=Mike | year=1988 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120402034849/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=472 | archivedate=April 2, 2012 | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> 
With the next album \'\'[[State of Mind (Front Line Assembly album)|State of Mind]]\'\', released in January 1988, the band switched to [[Germany|German]] independent label [[Dossier Records|Dossier]].<ref name="allmusicstateofmind">{{Allmusic | class=album | id=state-of-mind-mw0000674566 | label=Front Line Assembly: \'\'State of Mind\'\' > Overview | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

Having assumed producing and mixing duties before, Balch emerged as official band member in 1988<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" /> and began writing songs alongside Leeb for the next few albums. Balch mostly contributed by providing keyboards and programming. As Leeb put it, "I would write the songs, and he was really good with the software."<ref name="mphistory" /> This partnership produced the releases \'\'[[Corrosion (Front Line Assembly album)|Corrosion]]\'\' and \'\'Disorder\'\'. Originally planned to be issued on [[Canada|Canadian]] label [[Nettwerk]], which ultimately failed "because of politics and the previous Skinny Puppy relationship",<ref name="alternativepressinterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=472 |title=Interview |last=Shea |first=Mike |date=1988 |publisher=[[Alternative Press]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120402034849/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=472 |archivedate=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> both records mark the beginning of the cooperation with Third Mind in 1988. Label founder Gary Levermore recalled "Bill Leeb get in touch soon after he started Front Line Assembly and actually sending me two finished masters which became \'\'Corrosion\'\' and \'\'Disorder\'\'."<ref name="convulseinterviewlevermore">{{cite web | url=http://obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/2.11.html |title=Third Mind Records |last=Bains |first=Jon |publisher=Convulse |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990505072734/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/2.11.html |archivedate=May 5, 1999 |accessdate=August 7, 2014}}</ref> Through Levermore \'\'Corrosion\'\' was licensed to [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]]. Both records were re-released together with three more unreleased tracks on the [[Compilation album|compilations]] \'\'[[Convergence (Front Line Assembly album)|Convergence]]\'\' later that year and \'\'[[Corroded Disorder]]\'\' in 1995.

The change in labels for the first few releases before finally sticking with Third Mind was a deliberate choice. The reason for that was that Leeb did not want to be bound to a label.<ref name="chaoscontrolinterview93" /> Therefore, all releases before \'\'Corrosion\'\' were issued only on European labels,<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" /> which changed with \'\'Corrosion\'\' and subsequent albums. Adhering to Third Mind for Europe and Wax Trax! for North America made Front Line Assembly releases significantly more available. According to Leeb, this arrangement "worked out much better as far as distribution and promotion. [...] Third Mind is getting very good distribution in Europe."<ref name="joeradiointerview1988" /> Being signed to Third Mind also helped catching the attention of established music magazines such as \'\'[[Melody Maker]]\'\'<ref name="melodymakerrevcorrosion">{{cite journal | last=Stubbs | first=David | date=February 20, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Corrosion | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=253 | journal=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516020138/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=253 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevdisorder">{{cite journal | last=Stubbs | first=David | date=May 28, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Disorder | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=254 | journal=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516020201/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=254 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevconvergence">{{cite journal | author=The Stud Brothers | title=Front Line Assembly - Convergence CD | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=248 | journal=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516015443/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=248 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name="melodymakerrevgashed">{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Mat | title=Front Line Assembly - Gashed Senses & Crossfire | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=246 | journal=[[Melody Maker]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516015644/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=246 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref> or \'\'[[NME]]\'\'<ref name="nmerev">{{cite journal | last=Lamacq | first=Steve | date=May 7, 1988 | title=Front Line Assembly - Corrosion | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=253 | journal=[[NME]] | publisher=[[IPC Media]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516020138/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=253 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref> as well as underground magazines such as \'\'Music From the Empty Quarter\'\'.<ref name="emptyquarterrev">{{cite journal | author=Deadhead | title=Front Line Assembly - Convergence | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=248 | journal=Music From the Empty Quarter | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120516015443/http://www.mindphaser.com/index.php?page_id=248 | archivedate=May 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref> Front Line Assembly produced their next album \'\'[[Gashed Senses & Crossfire]]\'\' in 1989.

In [[1992 in music|1992]], Front Line Assembly reached a turning point in the band\'s musical style with the album \'\'[[Tactical Neural Implant]]\'\'. The media commented particularly on the more melodious approach featured on the album and noted the use of multi-layered sounds which would become a trademark of the band. \'\'[[Melody Maker]]\'\' described the album as "Front Line Assembly\'s most melodious and accessible album to date."<ref name="melodymakertnirev">{{cite journal |author=The Stud Brothers |year=1992 |title=Front Line Assembly - Tactical Neural Implant | journal=[[Melody Maker]] |location=London}}</ref> Siren Magazine called it "remarkably melodic and mellow, yet equally harsh and symphonic",<ref name="sireninterview">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subjectlink=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Ian Cheek |title=Interview |work=Siren |date=April 1992 |issue=9}}</ref> while fanzine Industrial Strength noted the "complex layering of sounds".<ref name="industrialstrengthtnirev">{{cite journal |year=1992 |title=Front Line Assembly: Tactical Neural Implant |journal=Industrial Strength |location=DeKalb, Illinois |issue=2 |page=27}}</ref> Asked about this composing style, Bill Leeb said to [[Industrialnation|Industrial Nation]]: "We just like to use and abuse technology as much as we can and always try to find new ways and pieces of gear to come up with new ideas and new songs."<ref name="interviewindnation1992">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Kim Traub |title=Interview |location=Oakland, California |work=[[Industrialnation|Industrial Nation]] |publisher=Paul Valerio |issue=5 |year=1992}}</ref> Only this time the band focused on "each particular sound and trying to put more definition on each sound and make it work longer than before."<ref name="interviewindnation1992"/> With that approach, the band "definitely tried to avoid making the same record twice" and to "do real song structures rather than just real heavy grooves."<ref name="interviewWCRD1992">{{cite interview |last=Leeb |first=Bill |subject-link=Bill Leeb |interviewer=Michael Tressler |title=Interview with Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly Live on WCRD |call-sign=CRD |city=Muncie, Indiana |date=March 19, 1992}}</ref>

This album helped FLA become one of [[industrial music|industrial]] music\'s most popular bands. The next album \'\'[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millennium]]\'\' ([[1994 in music|1994]])<ref name="allmusicstateofmind" /> featured a combination of [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitars, electronic music, and media sampling (much of which was taken from the [[Michael Douglas]] film \'\'[[Falling Down]]\'\') which had become one of the characteristics of [[industrial rock]] and [[industrial metal]] during the 1990s. \'\'[[Hard Wired]]\'\' ([[1995 in music|1995]])<ref name="allmusicstateofmind" /> and the [[Concert tour#Concert tour|world tour]] following the release was FLA\'s most successful commercial and critical period.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===The Peterson era: return to electronic sounds (1997\xe2\x80\x932002)===
In [[1997 in music|1997]], Fulber left the band to concentrate on producing [[Fear Factory]] along with other bands. [[Chris Peterson (producer)|Chris Peterson]], who had already supported the band\'s live shows, replaced Fulber. Soon after Fulber quit, the 1997 album \'\'[[FLAvour of the Weak|&#91;FLA&#93;vour of the Weak]]\'\' was released. Yet again, the album was stylistically divergent from previous releases. The metal influences found in \'\'[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millennium]]\'\' gave way to a more [[electronica]] sound within the new release.

Front Line Assembly made somewhat of a return to their former sound with the album \'\'[[Implode (album)|Implode]]\'\' ([[1999 in music|1999]]), followed by \'\'[[Epitaph (Front Line Assembly album)|Epitaph]]\'\' ([[2001 in music|2001]]), as well as half of the [[soundtrack]] for the video game \'\'[[Quake III Arena]]\'\' in [[1999 in music|1999]].  [[Chris Peterson (producer)|Chris Peterson]] left FLA in [[2002 in music|2002]]. Through most of that year it was rumoured that the band had essentially broken up.{{citation needed|date=April 2012|reason=Any "rumoured" anything always needs a source, or it fails the [[WP:WEASEL]] test.}}

===From classic line-up towards a full-fledged band (2003\xe2\x80\x932008)===
Rhys Fulber rejoined the band in [[2003 in music|2003]].  The reunited duo released the single \'\'[[Maniacal (song)|Maniacal]]\'\' in October of that same year, launching a new phase in the band\'s career. The next year, they released the studio album \'\'[[Civilization (album)|Civilization]]\'\'. Chris Peterson later rejoined the band to release \'\'[[Artificial Soldier]]\'\' in [[2006 in music|2006]]. The following tour was cut short due to a problem with the company supplying the tour bus. The band acknowledged that they were returning home to [[Vancouver]] earlier than planned after playing roughly half of their scheduled tour in the United States (dates in [[New York]] and [[Canada]] were canceled).  The band toured in [[Europe]] in August [[2006 in music|2006]] covering 18 cities.

In April [[2007 in music|2007]], Front Line Assembly released a remix album titled \'\'[[Fallout (Front Line Assembly album)|Fallout]]\'\'. The album was released in a 4-panel [[digipak]] and featured three previously unreleased tracks ("Electric Dreams," "Unconscious," and "Armageddon") and nine [[remix]]es by several other [[Industrial music|Industrial]] acts and names.<ref name="sidelinefallout">{{cite web | url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=22358_0_2_0_C | title=Forthcoming Front Line Assembly remix album countdown starts | work=Side-Line | date=April 19, 2007 | last=Van Isacker | first=B. | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> After the release of the [[remix]] album, the band went out to tour [[North America]] and [[Europe]].

===A new style of writing and new success (2009\xe2\x80\x932011)===
In [[2010 in music|2010]], Front Line Assembly, with new members [[Jeremy Inkel]] and [[Jared Slingerland]], released a new single, \'\'[[Shifting Through the Lens]]\'\', and album, \'\'[[Improvised Electronic Device]]\'\'.

As described on [[Dependent Records]]\' website, the album is described as "stronger and more danceable" when compared to immediately previous releases. "Angriff", the second single from the album, is further described as "wandering on metal paths reminiscent of [[Rammstein]] and their own \'\'[[Millennium (Front Line Assembly album)|Millenium]]\'\'{{sic}} album."<ref name="dependentshifting">{{cite web | title = Front Line Assembly - Shifting Through the Lens | publisher = [[Dependent Records|Dependent]] | url = http://dependent.de/index.php?lan=en&area=releases&id=149 | accessdate = 2010-04-17}}</ref>  In 2012, Leeb mentioned that a new album will be completed by the end of the year, though no official announcement or tour date has been released.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Back to the electronic roots and new influences (2012\xe2\x80\x932015)===
Having integrated guitars into their sound since the late 1980s, either sampled or as live guitars, FLA set the stage in 2012 for the return to an exclusively electronic soundscape. This change could be heard when the band released the soundtrack album \'\'[[AirMech (soundtrack)|AirMech]]\'\' for the video game of the same name at the end of 2012.<ref name="airmechonsteam">{{cite web | url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/216173/ | title=AirMech Soundtrack on Steam | publisher=Steamworks | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> Comprising only instrumental tracks, \'\'AirMech\'\' laid some grounds for 2013 full-length album \'\'[[Echogenetic]]\'\', as Bill Leeb recalls in an interview with Rock Sins: "I guess this sound of this record maybe it started pretty much with the record we did prior called \'\'AirMech\'\'."<ref name="interviewrocksinsechogenetic">{{cite web | url=http://www.rocksins.com/2013/09/interview-bill-leeb-front-line-assembly-18283/ | title=Interview with Bill Leeb (Front Line Assembly) | publisher=Rock Sins | last=Hill | first=Matt | date=September 2013 | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> \'\'Echogenetic\'\' was widely praised by critics, who also noted the [[dubstep]] influences on the record,<ref name="mpechogeneticreviews">{{cite web | url=http://www.mindphaser.com/echogenetic-review-roundup/ | title=Echogenetic Review Roundup | publisher=Mindphaser.com | date=July 8, 2013 | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> and hit the charts in the United States<ref name="echogeneticchartsus">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302513/front-line-assembly/chart | title=Front Line Assembly | publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref> and in Germany.

The same month Front Line Assembly returned from Europe, they joined Bill Leeb\'s former band Skinny Puppy on their \'\'Eye vs Spy\'\' North American tour as supporting band.

==Name spelling==
The spelling of the band name has varied over the years. Various albums (e.g. from the early \'\'[[State of Mind (Front Line Assembly album)|State of Mind]]\'\' to the recent \'\'[[Artificial Soldier]]\'\') spell the name in compound form ("Frontline Assembly") while the majority spell it in three words. (The [[abbreviation]] "FLA", also used on various albums, suggests that the correct spelling, to the extent that there is one, is indeed three separate words.) The music press has consequently not used any consistent spelling. During touring for [[Hard Wired]], Rhys Fulber explained the band\'s stance on the matter, referring to "Front Line": "Two words \xe2\x80\x93 I guess that ultimately it doesn\'t matter, but we prefer two words."<ref name="sonicenvelopefulberinterview2">{{cite web | url=http://www.sonicenvelope.com/interviews/fulber2.html | title=More "Stuff" Than "Dat" \xe2\x80\x93 an interview with Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly | publisher=Sonic Envelope Magazine | last=Blink | first=Anastasia | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030926015307/http://www.sonicenvelope.com/interviews/fulber2.html | archivedate=September 26, 2003 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

}}
\'\'\'Funker Vogt\'\'\' is a [[German people|German]] [[electronic music]] project with an aggressive style, formed by vocalist [[Jens K\xc3\xa4stel]] and programmer [[Gerrit Thomas]] in 1995. Other members of the band are keyboardist/manager [[Bjorn Bottcher]], live guitarist [[Frank Schweigert]] and lyricist [[Kai Schmidt]].  The name of the band translates from [[German language|German]] to [[English language|English]] as "[[Signaller|Radio Operator]] Vogt", this being the surname of a friend of the band who was a military radio operator.<ref name=allmusic>John Bush, \'\'[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p207235/biography|pure_url=yes}} Funker Vogt biography]\'\', allmusic. Retrieved 2010-01-02</ref> The military concept of a radio operator provides a contrast with the musical roles of a [[Disc jockey|DJ]] or a [[singer|vocalist]] using a [[microphone]].

==History==
The group appeared on several German compilations and, in 1996, released their debut album \'\'Thanks for Nothing\'\'. Following the release of two limited edition EPs (\'\'Words of Power\'\' and \'\'Take Care\'\'), Funker Vogt signed with the [[United States|American]] [[record label]] [[Metropolis Records]]. Metropolis re-released \'\'Thanks for Nothing\'\', followed by the \'\'We Came to Kill\'\' in late 1997.<ref name=allmusic/> Kastel and Thomas have participated, as remixers, on [[Le\xc3\xa6ther Strip]] album \'\'Yes, I\'m Limited, Vol. 2\'\'. In 2000, Funker Vogt released \'\'Maschine Zeit\'\', followed by the remix EP \'\'T\'\' in early 2001.<ref name=allmusic/> Additionally to the core members of the band, concert members also include [[Bj\xc3\xb6rn B\xc3\xb6ttcher]] (keyboard) and [[Frank Schweigert]] (guitar, he replaced [[Thomas Kroll]] in 2004). [[Kai Schmidt]] writes most of the lyrics and manages the band through his own management company.<ref>[http://www.funker-vogt.com/beta2007/history.asp Funker Vogt official site]. Retrieved 2010-01-02.</ref> They all hail from the town of [[Hamelin]] in [[Germany]]. The majority of their [[lyrics]] revolve around the concepts of [[war]].

A distinctive  theme is present in the band\'s work and stage presence; both their musicianship and their costuming are strongly reminiscent of military music and dress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191717811.html|title=Music the 3.(Time Out!)|last=Pizek|first=Jeff|date=November 27, 2008|work=Daily Herald|publisher=Paddock Publications via [[Highbeam Research]]|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref> This military aesthetic is also popular with the band\'s fanbase. However, the political stance of Funker Vogt is decidedly anti-war; the band cites "war and [[social injustice]]" as their primary topics of discussion, noting that the goal of the album \'\'Execution Tracks\'\', along with the accompanying video, was to "present the grotesque cruelties and the tragedy of war."

According to the band\'s website, as of 2011 both Bj\xc3\xb6rn B\xc3\xb6ttcher and Kai Schmidt are no longer collaborating with the band. As a result, Funker Vogt will no longer be managed by REPOMANagement.<ref>http://www.funker-vogt.com/beta2007/news.asp</ref> In 2013, longtime frontman Jens K\xc3\xa4stel left the band after his last show on November 30th in Berlin <ref>http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=50452_0_2_0_C</ref>

\'\'\'Haujobb\'\'\' is a [[Germany|German]] electronic musical project whose output has ranged drastically within the [[electronic music]] spectrum, from [[electro-industrial]] to [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[techno]].  They have become a staple crossover act, bringing several forms of electro into the mainstream industrial music world.

==History==
Haujobb was formed in 1993 by Daniel Myer, Dejan Samardzic, and Bj\xc3\xb6rn Junemann, pulling the name from the [[Blade Runner]] translation of "[[Replicant|skin job]]".<ref name="ebm-gr">{{cite web |url=http://www.ebm.gr/index.php/music/interviews/2736-interview-with-daniel-myer-haujobb-architect-destroid-covenant |title=Interview with Daniel Myer (Haujobb, Architect, Destroid, Covenant) |last= |first= |author=CVR |date=2010-12-22 |website=EBM.gr |series= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2013-08-18 |quote="It\'s supposed to be \xe2\x80\x9cHautjobb\xe2\x80\x9d, from the movie "Bladerunner". In the movie it\'s "Skinjob", but when we watched the movie in German I couldn\'t hear the "T" sound, so I just heard "Haujobb" and it made kind of sense. In German "Haujobb" means something like... beating up someone. In the movie it\xe2\x80\x99s a term for showing no respect to the androids... they call them \xe2\x80\x9cSkinjobs\xe2\x80\x9d, like calling "nigger" a black guy. It sounded to me something negative for something that doesn\'t exist yet, and it was cool!" |ref= |separator= |postscript=}}</ref>  They were soon signed to [[Off Beat (label)|Off Beat]], and began distributing their music in North America via [[Pendragon Records]].  1995 saw the departure of band mate Bj\xc3\xb6rn, and the lineup has consisted of Daniel and Dejan ever since.  After [[Metropolis Records]] acquired Pendragon, the two musicians have been able to spread their music to a larger fanbase in North America, and have remained continuously popular in the European [[industrial music]] scene.

Over the course of their subsequent releases in the 1990s, they wove increasing amounts of [[drum \'n\' bass]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]] influence into their sound.  1999\'s \'NinetyNine\' was a sparse, downtempo collection of ambient electronic compositions.  They have since reintroduced some of the more rhythmic elements back into their sound on their more recent albums, but have continued to experiment, drawing concepts from a wide variety of musical styles.

In Haujobb 2011 released a new album with the title "New World March" which according to the band uses more hardware, guitars, drums, and sound recordings compared to software based [[Vertical Theory]] of 2003.

\'\'\'Hocico\'\'\' (pronounced "Osziko"<ref>[http://definicion.dictionarist.com/hocico click to listen to pronunciation]</ref>) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[aggrotech]] [[Band (music)|band]].

== History ==

The duo was officially formed in 1993 by Erik Garcia a.k.a. Erk Aicrag ([[lyrics]] and [[vocals]]) and Oscar Mayorga a.k.a. Racso Agroyam ([[Programming (music)|Programming]]), but both cousins had been experimenting with [[electronic music]], mixing [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electronic body music|EBM]], since they were fifteen years old. Their music can be described as [[electro-industrial]]. Erk Aircrag and Racso Agroyam incited to express their feelings through technology, Preben AA from sounds of [[Zeromancer]] got sounds and ideas into their great minds. Given the influence of varying currents of electronic music (mainly [[Skinny Puppy]]) they began their trajectory in 1989 in a project called "Ni\xc3\xb1era Degenerada". Their lyrics are both in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as [[English language|English]]. The Spanish word \'\'hocico\'\' means \'\'[[snout]]\'\', and is used in Mexico as a disrespectful way to describe someone\'s comments coming out of their mouth.

Racso Agroyam has a side project called [[Dulce Liquido]].<br />

\'\'\'Icon of Coil\'\'\' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[electronic music]] band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by [[Andy LaPlegua]] who was joined by former Sector 9 (now [[Moonitor]] and [[Zombie Girl]]) bandmate [[Sebastian Komor]] to perform live. With the release of \'\'Shallow Nation\'\', the band\'s first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, [[Christian Lund]] joined the live lineup. Later that year the band\'s first full-length album, \'\'[[Serenity is the Devil]]\'\', was released, which climbed to number one on the [[Deutsche Alternative Charts]]. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member.

==History==
===Formation===
In 1997 Andy LaPlegua established the project, Icon of Coil, which was primarily a concept built around a logo, graphic design and music. Soon after the inception, the music soon turned out to be the most important part of the concept and LaPlegua invited Sebastian Komor, who he had worked with before on the project Sector 9, (now called Moonitor) in 1996, to work with him on the project as a live member. After just a couple of gigs and the release of IOC\xe2\x80\x99s first single, "Shallow Nation", Seb became a full-time member.

===\'\'Shallow Nation\'\' (2000)===
\'\'Shallow Nation\'\', released early in 2000, sold out the first thousand copies after only two weeks in the stores, which resulted in a deal with the Norwegian record label [[Tatra Records]]. Around that same time Tatra Records released the compilation Sex, Goth & Electronics, to which IOC contributed an exclusive version of their song "Repeat It".

Before they started working on their second release IOC did programming for the [[Apoptygma Berzerk]] track "Starsign". Soon afterwards, they traveled to Germany, with live member Jon Holm, to support Apoptygma on their Welcome to Earth tour 2000 at their gigs in Frankfurt, Cottbus and Leipzig before going back to Norway to play together at Rockefeller in Oslo.

One Nation Under Beat debuted in the top 20 on the DAC-chart (Deutsch Alternative Chart) for eight weeks and peaked at number three.

In late spring of 2000 at a gig in Uddevalla, Sweden, Christian Lund joined the band as a live-member and went on stage with Andy and Seb for the first time. Along with being the vocalist for his En Route project, Christian had a background from a melodious EBM Fredrikstad-band called Elected By Fear where he played together with Fredrik Hansen from Echo Image (who also played at that gig) and Marius Johnsen from Centravibe.

===\'\'Serenity is the Devil\'\' (2000\xe2\x80\x932001)===

After the release of IOC\'s first full-length \'\'[[Serenity is the Devil]]\'\' in November 2000, which reached number three on the DAC-chart, the band went to Germany together with Beborn Beton. With nine gigs, positive feedback from the audience and very good reviews on the debut album, IOC gained a following in the synth/industrial scene.

Shortly afterward, the album crossed the [[Atlantic]] and was released in [[North America]] by [[Metropolis Records]]. On March 29, 2001, the band itself followed and boarded a plane to [[Chicago]]. The song \'\'Situations Like These\'\' from the (then) forthcoming \'\'Seren\'\' EP was played live for the first time to an American audience. 

The summer started with a successful show in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]], at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]]. The following festivals included [[Christopher Street Day|CSD]], [[Zillo Festival]], [[Xtreaktor Festival]], [[Eurorock]], [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] and ended at [[M\'era Luna]].

\'\'Situations Like These\'\' became a big club hit and the band was ready for a second tour (this time in a Nightliner touring bus) of North America with [[VNV Nation]]. The leg began in Chicago on the 16th of November. Icon of Coil, [[VNV Nation]] and the rest of the crew continued up to [[Canada]], down the east coast to [[Florida]], through [[Texas]] to the West coast and [[Hollywood]], where they did their 15th show. The four-week tour ended in [[Edmonton]], Canada.

===\'\'The Soul is in the Software\'\' (2002)===
During their tours, the band found the time to write material for their second album, \'\'[[The Soul is in the Software]]\'\', which was released in April 2002 and stayed at number one on the DAC for several weeks. IOC then performed at two more festivals: The Dark Jubilee Festival in [[London]], and later as the Sunday headliner for Synthpop Goes the World in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].

===\'\'Machines Are Us\'\' (2004) and \'\'Uploaded And Remixed\'\' (2004)===
In 2004, their third album, \'\'[[Machines Are Us]]\'\', was released. Icon of Coil then released their remix album \'\'[[UploadedAndRemixed|Uploaded And Remixed]]\'\' at the tail end of 2004, which featured new mixes of songs from their first two records and two exclusive tracks.

===Present & Future===
Icon of Coil reunite sporadically for live performances. They announced at their recent Sydney show that they will be writing new material.

On August 6, 2012, Icon of Coil released a new song, \'\'PerfectSex\'\' as a pay-what-you-want download on Bandcamp.<ref>http://iconofcoil.bandcamp.com/track/perfectsex</ref> A new studio album is currently in production.<ref name="perfectsex">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackvector.se/icon-of-coil-are-back-at-it-new-single-out-now-and-album-on-the-way|title=Icon Of Coil are back at it! - New single out now and album on the way|work=Blackvector Magazine|first=Bj\xc3\xb6rn|last=Andersson|date=August 6, 2012|accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> Most recently, in July 2013 IOC performed on the main stage at the Amphi Music Festival IX in K\xc3\xb6ln (Cologne), Germany.

\'\'\'Kevorkian Death Cycle\'\'\' is an [[electro-industrial]] band from [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], [[California]], [[USA]].

The band was originally named \'\'Grid\'\' and later changed their name to the politically motivated \'\'Kevorkian Death Cycle\'\'.  The band released its first album, \'\'Collection for Injection\'\', on the [[Ras Dva]] label. After a 1997 tour with [[Spahn Ranch (band)|Spahn Ranch]], they became popular with the underground community.  The band moved to the [[Metropolis Records|Metropolis]] label in 1998 and in the fall released their second album \'\'Dark Skies\'\'.  They later played with [[Front 242]] and went on tour with [[Front Line Assembly]].

In 1999, they released their third album, \'\'A+0(M)\'\'.  This album contained a cover of [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]\'s "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]".  They also went on their two-month "Free Jack" tour of North America.  ("Jack" here refers to [[Jack Kevorkian]].)

\'\'Collection for Injection\'\' was re-issued in 2000, and a re-mix single of their cover of "Relax" was released in 2001.

In 2004, they re-released \'\'Trickster\'\' as \'\'[[Trickster (album)#Trickstereprocess|Trickstereprocess]]\'\', with digitally remastered tracks, five bonus tracks and a bonus DVD. After the release of \'\'Trickstereprocess\'\', [[Free Dominguez]] went on to create an [[independent record label|indie]] project while Bruce Somers created the band [[ShockNina]].

In 2013, Free Dominguez sang on the soundtrack to \'\'[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]\'\' on the track \'\'A Stranger I Remain (Maniac Agenda Mix)\'\'.

===Guest appearances and collaborations===

Free Dominguez has contributed vocals to the third [[Conjure One]] album, \'\'[[Exilarch (album)|Exilarch]]\'\' on the song "Run For Cover", as well as on [[Beat Ventriloquists]] EP, \'\'[[Goodnight Memory]]\'\' on the song "Unfolding", and will collaborate with them again on their forthcoming debut album. In 2004, Free\'s vocals were also featured on a number of songs, including "Geisha Superfly", "War of Love", "Invisible", "Kickstand" & "Rhinestone Halo" which she wrote for "The Insider project", a joint venture project with Matt "Dr." Fink of The Revolution and DJ Insider. Free\'s backing vocals can be heard on [[Zeromancer]]\'s album, \'\'[[Clone Your Lover]]\'\' on songs "Flirt (with Me)" & "Houses Of Cards". She sang the latter live on stage with Zeromancer in Germany. Free also fronted for Conjure One in Germany around the same time, then performed again with them in London shortly afterwards. (May 2010). Free Dominguez was featured on [[KMFDM]]\'s 2011 album, \'\'[[WTF?!]]\'\', on the song, "Take It Like A Man". 
Aside from collaborations, Free has released solo material, the first being her debut album, "freedoming", which is currently Sold Out. A music video, "Questions & Lies" was made too which sounded different from the album version being more upbeat, titled "Questions & Lies (With Drums)" later being released as part of the iTunes exclusive "Freedoming - EP". For her second solo effort she recorded mkmkmlllany songs, which were to be released on the album, "Core: A Zone", which was postponed due to kidneythieves being brought back together, and has since been unreleased, however in 2006 Free released a taster of the album in the form of the 5-track "Core: A Zone - EP". Free also recorded a cover of "Heart Of Gold" during this time. In late 2011 and early 2012 Free performed solo gigs, as well as opening for Jimmy Gnecco. Free sent out newsletters indicating that her third solo album, "Volcano + The Sea" would get a Spring 2012 release, delighting many fans worldwide. Also she had been planning on repackaging a selection of songs from her first two solo records for sometime, and finally announced an early 2012 release for them. 

Bruce Somers has been working with the band Good Charlotte on their live production for their current world tour. Bruce mastered the latest releases from [[Richard Patrick]]\'s band "Filter" as well as the latest CD\'s by Rob Zombie guitarist John 5.  Bruce composed the music for "Coming Up Roses," a new film featuring Bernadette Peters. The feature was directed by Lisa Albright. Look for a theatrical release in 2011.  Bruce recently composed the music for the 27th Northrop Grumman National Space Symposium.

\'\'\'KMFDM\'\'\' <!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO KEIN MITLEID F\xc3\x9cR DIE MEHRHEIT; IT IS INTENDED TO BE GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE TRANSLATION TO "no majority for the pity"; WE ARE USING THE OFFICIAL BAND TRANSLATION IN THE LEAD, AND EXPLAINING IT IN THE BODY-->(originally \'\'\'Kein Mehrheit F\xc3\xbcr Die Mitleid\'\'\', loosely translated as "no pity for the majority")<ref name="1997 History"/> is an [[industrial music|industrial]] band led by German [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Sascha Konietzko]], who founded the group in 1984 as a performance art project. KMFDM has released nineteen studio albums and two dozen singles, with sales of more than two million records worldwide.

The band has undergone many line-up changes and featured dozens of guest musicians. Its earliest incarnation included German drummer [[En Esch]] and British vocalist [[Raymond Watts]], the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. German guitarist [[G\xc3\xbcnter Schulz]] joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin), and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer [[Lucia Cifarelli]], British guitarists [[Jules Hodgson]] and [[Steve White (guitarist)|Steve White]], and British drummer [[Andy Selway]].

Critics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band\'s music as "The Ultra-Heavy Beat". The band incorporates [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] guitar riffs, [[electronic music]], samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles. KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release, and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans, both online and at concerts. Members, singly or working with each other and others, have recorded under many other names, primarily Watts\' [[Pig (musical project)|Pig]] in 1988, Konietzko\'s [[Excessive Force]] in 1991, and Esch and Schulz\'s [[Slick Idiot]] in 2001.

==History==

===Origin (1984)===
[[File:KMFDM Castle Party 2009 07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sascha Konietzko]] performing in Bolk\xc3\xb3w, Poland in July 2009]]
<!--***PLEASE read ALL of this paragraph AND the talk page before changing to "Kein Mitleid F\xc3\xbcr Die Mehrheit"***-->
KMFDM is an [[initialism]] for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect [[German (language)|German]] phrase \'\'Kein Mehrheit F\xc3\xbcr Die Mitleid\'\', which literally translates as "no majority for the pity", but is typically given the loose translation of "no pity for the majority".<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/><ref name=deseret-may-1995/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/outcast-clique-proud-role-article-1.830051 | author=Kennedy, Helen | title=Outcast Clique Proud of Role | work=[[New York Daily News]] | publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]] | date=April 21, 1999 | accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=CMJ-604/> In the original phrase, the articles preceding the nouns \'\'Mehrheit\'\' and \'\'Mitleid\'\' are [[inflection|inflected]] for the wrong [[grammatical gender|gender]], as the proper [[declension]] would be \'\'Keine Mehrheit f\xc3\xbcr das Mitleid.\'\' Swapping the two nouns yields the grammatically correct \'\'Kein Mitleid F\xc3\xbcr Die Mehrheit\'\', which translates directly as "no pity for the majority". In a 2003 interview, Konietzko explained the origins of the phrase:

{{quote|text="On the morning of February 29th, 1984 I woke up and went down to breakfast at a hotel in Paris. We had a show that night opening for an exhibition for young European artists.&nbsp;... we needed a motto for the night so that we could make up some fliers and post them around. There was a German newspaper on the table and so I started cutting out words and threw them all into a cap. We picked a few of them out and it read "Kein Mehrheit Fur Die Mitleid<nowiki>["]</nowiki>. It\'s kinda improper German in regards to its translation but in the [[Dada|DA-DA]]-esque{{sic}} mindset of the early morning it made perfect sense. So when I was on my way back to Hamburg I\'d mentioned it to [[Raymond Watts|Raymond [Watts]]]. He liked it but he was having difficulty pronouncing it correctly. So finally he said, \'Why don\'t you just call it KMFDM?\' So that was it. We were KMFDM."<ref name=mk/>}}

KMFDM was officially founded in Paris, France, on February 29, 1984, as a [[performance art]] project between [[Sascha Konietzko]] and German painter and multimedia artist Udo Sturm at the opening of an exhibition of young European artists at the [[Grand Palais]].<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> The first show consisted of Sturm playing an [[ARP 2600]] synthesizer, Konietzko playing vacuum cleaners and bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout the building,<ref name="WDYKD">{{cite AV media notes | title=What Do You Know, Deutschland? | titlelink=What Do You Know, Deutschland? | others=KMFDM | year=2006 | type=CD booklet | page=2 | publisher=[[Metropolis Records]] | id=MET439 | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}</ref> and four Polish coal miners (whom Konietzko had met at a [[bordello]])<ref name="RS740"/> pounding on the foundations of the Grand Palais.<ref name="1997 History">{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html | title=KMFDM History| publisher=KMFDM Inc | accessdate=April 25, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19970408173452/http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html |archivedate = April 8, 1997}}</ref>

\'\'\'Laibach\'\'\' ({{IPA-sl|\xcb\x88l\xc3\xa1jbax}}) is a [[Slovenia]]n  [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] music group associated with [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Martial industrial|martial]], and [[Neoclassical (Dark Wave)|neo-classical]] musical styles. Laibach was formed on 1 June 1980 in [[Trbovlje]], [[Slovenia]], at the time [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. The band represents the music wing of the \'\'[[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]\'\' (NSK) art collective, of which it was a founding member in 1984. The name "Laibach" is the [[German language|German]] name for Slovenia\'s capital city, [[Ljubljana]].

== History ==

=== Laibach with Toma\xc5\xbe Hostnik (1980\xe2\x80\x931982) ===
Laibach was formed on June 1, 1980 in [[Trbovlje]], a mining-industry town, taking the [[German language]] version of the name for the city of [[Ljubljana]], used during the period when it was a part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|World War II occupation of Yugoslavia]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127">{{harvnb|Janjatovi\xc4\x87|2006|p=127}}</ref> At the time, the group collaborated with art groups Irwin (painting) and Rde\xc4\x8di Pilot (theatre).<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Since its formation, the group had been preparing their first multimedia project "Rde\xc4\x8di revirji" ("Red District"), aiming to provoke the current political structures in Trbovlje.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The performance was banned before its opening due to its "improper and irresponsible" usage of [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich\'s black crosses]] as symbols on the posters, causing a lot of negative reaction in the media and public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The group\'s visual style at this earliest stage focused mainly on mining iconography, but in time, they included other symbols as well: [[Triglav]], deer horns and the Malevich\'s black cross rounded with a [[gear]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

The first live appearance and an exhibition entitled "\xc5\xbdrtve letalske nesre\xc4\x8de" ("Victims of an Air Accident") took place in January 1982 at the Ljubljana club FV, followed by performances in [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> At the time, the group\'s musical style was characterized by critics as "[[industrial rock]]", and for their live performances they used gramophones, radio devices and electronic instruments constructed by themselves.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Instead of the dry ice stage effect, the group used original military smoke bombs which was as unpleasant for themselves as for the audience.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>  At the Novi Rock festival in Ljubljana during the same year, the frontman Toma\xc5\xbe Hostnik appeared in a military uniform and despite being hit by a bottle in the face, causing him serious injuries, he managed to bring the performance to an end.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> However, Hostnik committed suicide in December 1982.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

=== Dissident status in Yugoslavia (1983\xe2\x80\x931985) ===
[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 1983.jpg|thumb|LAIBACH Press Photo 1983]]
In April 1983 the group resumed its activities with a live appearance in Ljubljana, featuring guest performances by the [[England|English]] bands [[The Last Few Days]] and [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]], for which recordings of dogs barking and snarling were used as the concert intro.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The day after the performance, the group received considerable media coverage for a concert at the Zagreb Biennale entitled "Mi kujemo bodo\xc4\x8dnost" ("We Forge the Future"), during which the group used simultaneous projections of a pornographic movie and the film \'\'Revolucija \xc5\xa1e traja\'\' (\'\'The Revolution is Still Going On\'\').<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The performance was eventually interrupted by the police, forcing the group to leave the stage after the appearance of a [[human penis|penis]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]] at the same time on the screens.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The subsequent debut television appearance on June 23, 1983, in the informative-political program \'\'TV Tednik\'\', caused major negative reactions after which they were banned from using the name Laibach as well as performing in public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

The group then started an international \'\'The Occupied Europe Tour \'83\'\', with the group The Last Few Days, which included sixteen dates in eight [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Western Europe]]an countries.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The performances provoked a lot of interest in the European media, especially with the totalitarian musical and visual style.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The [[socialist realism]] background, effective live appearances and a dissident status in their home country provided the group with a swift increase of interest of the Western countries.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Their provocative usage of symbols from [[Nazi Germany]] firstly provoked the Slovene WW2 Veteran Organization in Yugoslavia.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> By combining the imagery of socialist realism, [[Nazism]] and [[Italy|Italian]] [[futurism]], the group created a unique aesthetic style which could not pass unnoticed by the public.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The song lyrics were initially written in [[German language]], but having included cover versions of [[English language]] songs, the group focused more on the latter language.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

In 1984, the group moved to London and started working as labourers, acted as soldiers in [[Stanley Kubrick]]\'s \'\'[[Full Metal Jacket]]\'\' and worked at a pier in [[Belfast]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Due to the fact that they were banned from using the name Laibach, the group held a secret concert at the Ljubljana Mal\xc4\x8di Beli\xc4\x8d hall dedicated to the deceased Toma\xc5\xbe Hostnik.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During that period, the group, with their early collaborators Irwin and Rde\xc4\x8di Pilot founded the informal art organization \'\'[[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]\'\' (German for \'\'New Slovene Art\'\').

The following year, the group released their debut studio album, \'\'[[Laibach (album)|Laibach]]\'\', through the Ljubljana \xc5\xa0KUC Ropot label, which did not feature the group name on the album cover, due to its ban, and a sample from a speech by Tito on one of the album tracks was also censored.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During the same year, the German label WUS released a compilation album \'\'[[Rekapitulacija 1980\xe2\x80\x931984]]\'\' (\'\'Recapitulation 1980-1984\'\').<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> With the Gledali\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8de Sester Scipion Nasice, the group performed in their own play \'\'Krst pod Triglavom\'\' (\'\'A Baptism Under Triglav\'\') at the Ljubljana Cankarjev dom.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During 1985, the group also released its second album \'\'[[Nova Akropola]]\'\' (\'\'The New Acropolis\'\') via [[Great Britain|British]] [[independent record label]] Cherry Red.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> After the album release, the group performed its first legal concert in Hum (Slovenia), entitled "Krvava gruda, plodna zemlja" ("Bloody Land, Fertile Soil").  They had asked the 12th congress of the SSO of Slovenia to be allowed to use the name Laibach and have public performances, a request which had been accepted. The group subsequently got the "Zlata ptica" ("The Golden Bird") award at the Yugoslav Youth Day.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

=== International breakthrough (1986\xe2\x80\x931991) ===
In London, the famous [[disc jockey]] [[John Peel]] recorded three songs with the group for his show, and the group performed in the [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]] play \'\'No Fire Escape from Hell\'\'.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Having signed for [[Mute Records]], the group started recording their third studio album, \'\'[[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]\'\', with Slavko Avsenik Jr.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The inner sleeve of the cover featured a [[swastika]] consisting of four bloodied axes designed by [[John Heartfield]], an anti-Nazi artist. The record was sold secretly in some European countries.,<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> as the meaning of the cover was not recognised. The usage of Nazi symbols and the name "Opus Dei" caused the [[Opus Dei|Catholic institution of the same name]] to sue the group but the case was eventually decided in favour of Laibach.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> Following the album release, the group embarked on a European tour, during which they stated at a press conference in [[France]] that their influences are Tito, [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and [[Jacques Tati|Tati]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>
[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 1989.jpg|thumb|left|LAIBACH Press Photo 1989]]
In Hamburg, the group performed and wrote the music for an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]\'s \'\'[[Macbeth]]\'\' at the [[Deutsches Schauspielhaus]], which was eventually released in 1989 as \'\'[[Macbeth (album)|Macbeth]]\'\'.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> In 1988, the group released the album \'\'[[Let It Be (Laibach album)|Let It Be]]\'\', featuring cover versions of all the songs from the [[Beatles]] album [[Let it Be (album)|of the same name]], with the exception of the title track, which they did not record owing to lack of studio time, and "[[Maggie Mae]]", which was replaced by the German anthems "[[Auf der L\xc3\xbcneburger Heide]]" and "Was Gleicht Wohl Auf Erden".<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> A part of the recorded material from the album was broadcast by [[Paul McCartney]] before his concerts.

In 1989, their performance in Zagreb started with the Serbian instrument the [[gusle]] and in Belgrade, the NSK philosopher [[Peter Mlakar]] held a speech as a cynical parody of [[Slobodan Milo\xc5\xa1evi\xc4\x87]]\'s speeches in [[SAP Kosovo]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The following year, the group released the EP \'\'[[Sympathy for the Devil (EP)|Sympathy for the Devil]]\'\', an album of different cover versions of the [[Rolling Stones]] [[Sympathy for the Devil|song of the same name]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The group also achieved a commercial success with the cover versions of "[[Live is Life]]" by [[Opus (Austrian band)|Opus]] and "[[One Vision]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> During the same year, on December 21, the group celebrated their tenth anniversary with a first ever live performance in their hometown Trbovlje. The concert also marked the official foundation of the state of the Neue Slowenische Kunst movement, complete with its own currency, flag and passport. After this concert, the group undertook a tour of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

=== Commercial success and after (1992\xe2\x80\x93present) ===
During 1991, Slovenia became an independent state.
In 1992, the group released \'\'[[Kapital (album)|Kapital]]\'\' an album featuring their own vision of [[materialism]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The following year, Mute Records released the \'\'[[Ljubljana\xe2\x80\x93Zagreb\xe2\x80\x93Beograd]]\'\' live album, recorded at performances in the three cities in 1982, presenting a document of politically active rock from the group\'s early career, especially in the songs "Tito-Tito", "Dr\xc5\xbeava" ("The State"), and "Rde\xc4\x8di molk" ("Red Silence").<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> In 1994, they released the album \'\'[[NATO (album)|NATO]]\'\', which commented on the current political events in Eastern Europe, former Yugoslavia and the actions of the [[NATO]] pact, filtered through their vision of [[techno music|techno]] and [[pop music|pop]]. The album featured cover versions of [[Europe]]\'s "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]", [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] "[[In the Army Now (song)|In the Army Now]]", [[Don Fardon]]\'s "[[Indian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian)|Indian Reservation]]" (renamed to "National Reservation"), and the [[Stanislav Bini\xc4\x8dki]] composition "[[Mar\xc5\xa1 na Drinu]]" ("March on the [[Drina]]").<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/>

Following the album release, the group went on the \'\'Occupied Europe NATO Tour 1994-95\'\', resulting in the live and video album of the same name, which featured a selection of recordings from the two-year tour, including the performance in [[Sarajevo]] on the date of the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]].<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> In 1995, the group for a while considered splitting into several simultaneous lineups so that they could perform in different places at the same time, but the idea was abandoned.<ref name="Janjatovic 127"/> The following year, the group released \'\'[[Jesus Christ Superstars]]\'\', a reference to the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\'s [[rock opera]] \'\'[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]\'\'.<ref name="Janjatovic 128">{{harvnb|Janjatovi\xc4\x87|2006|p=128}}</ref> The group promoted the album in the USA with an eighteen-date tour, as well as a German tour.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/> 
[[File:LAIBACH Press Photo 2003.jpg|thumb|LAIBACH Press Photo 2003]]
On May 15, 1997, the group performed with the Slovenian symphony orchestra, conducted by Marko Letonja, and the "Tone Tom\xc5\xa1i\xc4\x87" choir, for the opening ceremony of the Ljubljana European Month of Culture, presenting orchestral versions of their earliest material, which they rarely performed live, arranged by Uro\xc5\xa1 Rojko and Aldo Kumar with the members of the group.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  During the same year, the live album \'\'[[M.B. December 21, 1984]]\'\' was released, featuring recordings of the forbidden concert in the Ljubljana Malci Beli\xc4\x87 Hall, a February 1985 concert at the [[Berlin]] Atonal festival, and the April 1985 performance at the Zagreb club [[Kulu\xc5\xa1i\xc4\x87]].<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The performances had featured a guest appearance by Jo\xc5\xbee Pegam on clarinet and trumpet, and recordings of Tito\'s speeches.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/> On November 14, 1997 at a concert in Belgrade, another Peter Mlakar speech received a decidedly mixed audience reaction (in sharp contrast to the 1989 speech), in which he asked the audience to "eat the pig and digest it once and for all", referring to the then president Slobodan Milo\xc5\xa1evi\xc4\x87.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>

In 2003, the group released the album \'\'[[WAT (album)|WAT]]\'\' (an acronym for \'\'We Are Time\'\'), which, as well as new material, featured the song "Tanz mit Laibach" (German for "Dance with Laibach"), inspired by the German band [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F]].<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The song lyrics were co-written with Peter Mlakar, and the music was co-written with the producer [[Iztok Turk]] (former member of [[Videosex]]) and the [[DJ]]s Umek, Bizzy and Dojaja.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The following year, the group released a double compilation album \'\'Anthems\'\', featuring a career spanning selection of material as well as the previously unreleased song "Mama Leone", a [[Drafi Deutscher]] cover, and remixes by Random Logic, Umek, Octex, Iztok Turk and others.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The compilation also features a thorough group biography written by Alexei Monroe.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The group also released two [[DVD]]\'s: the first, \'\'Laibach\'\', featured music videos, including a new music video for the song "Das Spiel is aus", and \'\'A film about WAT\'\' directed by Sa\xc5\xa1o Podgor\xc5\xa1ek.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  The second DVD was \'\'2\'\' with a recording from the \'\'Occupied Europe NATO Tour\'\' concert in Ljubljana on October 26, 1995 and \'\'A Film from Slovenia\'\', directed by Daniel Landin and Peter Vezjak.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>

In 2004, the group recorded \'\'The Divided States of America - Laibach 2004 Tour\'\', released on DVD in 2006 and directed by Sa\xc5\xa1o Podgor\xc5\xa1ek during the group\'s fourth USA tour.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/> During 2006, the group released the album \'\'[[Volk (album)|Volk]]\'\' (German for \'\'People\'\'), featuring cover versions of national anthems, including the NSK state anthem "Das Lied der Deutschen", originally written in 1797 and used during the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  Each cover featured a guest vocalist singing the anthem in their own language.<ref name="Janjatovic 128"/>  During the same year, on June 1, the group performed [[J.

In July 2014 Laibach released an EP to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The project was commissioned by Poland\'s National Cultural Centre and includes a reworking of one of the classic songs of the insurgency; "Warszawskie Dzieci" ("Children of Warsaw").<ref>{{cita news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/176305,Laibach-to-release-Warsaw-Rising-tribute/|title=Laibach to release Warsaw Rising tribute|editore=PolskieRadio.pl|data=15 July 2014}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
[[File:Laibach Live in Budapest, Hungary, April 2014.jpg|thumb|Laibach Live in Budapest, Hungary, April 2014]]
Some early Laibach albums were pure industrial, with hard industrial percussion, heavy rhythms, and roaring vocals. Later in the mid-80s, the Laibach sound became more richly layered with samples from [[classical music]] including from [[Gustav Holst]]\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[The Planets]]\'\'. The band began their tradition of cover songs in 1987 with the album \'\'Opus Dei\'\', where their sound changed again.

Laibach\'s [[cover song|cover version]]s are often used to subvert the original message or intention of the song &mdash; a notable example being their version of the song "[[Life is Life]]" by [[Opus (Austrian band)|Opus]], an [[Austria]]n arena rock band. Laibach recorded two new interpretations of the song, which they titled Leben Hei\xc3\x9ft Leben, and Opus Dei.  The first of these, the opening song on the Laibach album \'\'[[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]\'\' (1987), was sung in [[German language|German]].  The second was promoted as a [[single (music)|single]], and its promotional video (which used the title "[[Life is Life]]") was played extensively on American cable channel [[MTV]].<ref>Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine: Laibach and NSK.  MIT Press, 2005. p 231</ref> Opus Dei retained some of the original song\'s [[English language|English]] lyrics, but was delivered in a musical style that left the meaning of the lyrics open to further interpretation. Whereas the original is a feel-good pop anthem, Laibach\'s subversive interpretation twists the melody into a triumphant military march.  With the exception of the promotional video, the refrain is at one point translated into German, giving an example of the sensitivity of lyrics to their context. The \'\'[[Opus Dei (album)|Opus Dei]]\'\' album also features a cover of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]\'s "[[One Vision]]" with lyrics translated into German under the title \'\'[[The Birth of a Nation|Geburt einer Nation]]\'\', revealing the ambiguity of lines like "One race one hope/One real decision". In \'\'[[NATO (album)|NATO]]\'\' (1994), Laibach also memorably re-worked [[Europe (band)|Europe]]\'s [[glam metal]] anthem "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]" as a bombastic [[disco]] epic.

Other notable covers include the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] album \'\'[[Let It Be (Laibach album)|Let It Be]]\'\' (1988), and their maxi-single \'\'[[Sympathy for the Devil (EP)|Sympathy for the Devil]]\'\' (1988) which [[deconstruction|deconstructs]] the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] song of the same name with seven different interpretations.

In 2004, Laibach covered the song \'\'Ohne Dich\'\' by [[Rammstein]] in a significantly altered version. Unlike the solo male vocals in the Rammstein original, this cover features both male and female vocals (supplied by Laibach\'s Milan Fras and Mina \xc5\xa0piler from the band [[Melodrom]]), and the orchestral sound of the original has been supplemented &mdash; and in some sections even replaced &mdash; by a more electronic element. The lyrics of the song were also subtly altered, most noticeably in the chorus: the original version was "Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein" (roughly: "without you I cannot exist"), whereas Laibach\'s reworked chorus declares "Ohne mich kannst du nicht sein" (roughly: "Without me you cannot exist").

Laibach not only reference modern artists through reinterpretation, but also sample or reinvent older musical pieces. For example, their song "Anglia" is based on the national anthem of the [[United Kingdom]], \'\'[[God Save the Queen]]\'\'. This song, and other based on national anthems are released on \'\'[[Volk (album)|Volk]]\'\' album, which is a collection of Laibach\'s versions of national anthems of countries such as the United States and Russia. On this album they also included an anthem for their NSK State in Time, which is based on their song \'\'The Great Seal\'\' from the \'\'[[Opus Dei]]\'\' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volk.htm |title=Volk |publisher=Laibach |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>

They have also toured with an audio-visual performance centered on [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]\'s \'\'[[The Art of Fugue|Die Kunst der Fuge]]\'\'. Since this work has no specifications of acquired instruments and is furthermore [[The Art of Fugue#The permutation matrix|based on mathematical principles]], Laibach has argued that the music can be seen as proto-[[techno]]. Therefore, the band found \'\'Die Kunst der Fuge\'\' to be ideal for an interpretation using computers and software.

In 2009 Laibach also reworked [[Richard Wagner]]\'s \'\'Overture to [[Tannh\xc3\xa4user (opera)|Tannh\xc3\xa4user]]\'\', \'\'Siegfried-Idyll\'\' and \'\'The Ride Of The Valkyries\'\' in collaboration with the symphonic orchestra RTV Slovenia, conducted by Izidor Leitinger. Laibach\'s version is titled "VolksWagner".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/volkswagner/ |title=Laibach Volkswagner |publisher=Laibach.nsk.si |date=2009-04-18 |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>

In addition to cover songs, Laibach has remixed songs by other bands. These include two songs by the Florida death metal band [[Morbid Angel]] that appear on the Morbid Angel EP \'\'Laibach Re-mixes\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morbidangel.com/laibach.html |title=Discography |publisher=MorbidAngel.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>

In 2009 Laibach made new versions of their own songs from the early 1980s such as \'\'Brat moj\'\', \'\'Boji\'\' and \'\'Smrt za smrt\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laibach http://www.laibach.nsk.si/ |url=http://www.laibach.nsk.si/rec.htm |title=Recent News |publisher=Laibach |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> They have been performed live and will be released on the album Laibach Revisited.

== Aesthetics, image, and controversy ==
[[File:Laibach riga 2015.03.19-melnaa piektdiena.JPG|thumb|Laibach live in Riga, Latvia. Club "Meln\xc4\x81 piektdiena". 2015-03-19.]]
Although primarily a musical group, Laibach have sometimes worked in other media.  In their early years, especially before the founding of [[Neue Slowenische Kunst|Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK)]], Laibach produced several works of visual art.  A notable example was \'\'MB 84 Memorandum\'\' (1984) an image of a black [[cross]] that served as a way to advertise Laibach\'s appearances during a period in the 1980s when the government of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] banned the name "Laibach".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artmargins.com/content/review/griffin.html|title=ARTMargins - Winifred M. Griffin: Review of Laibach and Irwin|accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref> Cross imagery, and variations on the cross are apparent in many Laibach recordings and publications.

The visual imagery of Laibach\'s art (or \'Laibach Kunst\', as it calls itself) has been described as "radically ambiguous".<ref>Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine.  MIT Press, 2005.  p76.</ref>  An early example of this ambiguity would be the woodcut entitled \'\'The Thrower,\'\' also known as \'\'Metalec\'\' (\'\'The Metal Worker\'\'). This work features a monochrome silhouette of a figure with a clenched fist holding a hammer. The work could be seen by its original Slovene viewers as a poster promoting industrial protest, but the poster could have also been interpreted as a symbol of industrial pride. Another aspect of this woodcut is the large typefaced word \'LAIBACH\', evoking memories of the [[Nazi]] occupation of Slovenia (when the capital city was briefly known as Laibach). This piece was featured prominently during a TV interview of Laibach in 1983, during which the interviewer Jure Pengov called Laibach "enemies of the people."<ref>Monroe, Alexei.  Interrogation Machine.  MIT Press, 2005.  p161.</ref>

Laibach has frequently been accused of both [[far left]] and [[far right]] political stances due to their use of [[uniform]]s and [[totalitarian]]-style [[aesthetics]]. They were  also accused of being members of the [[neo-nationalism]] movement, which reincarnates modern ideas of [[nationalism]]. When confronted with such accusations, Laibach are quoted as replying with the ambiguous response "We are [[fascist]]s as much as [[Hitler]] was a painter".<ref name="VH1">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/laibach/bio.jhtml|title=VH1.com Laibach Biography|accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref>

The members of Laibach are notorious for rarely stepping out of character. Some releases feature artwork by the [[Communist]] and early [[Dada]] artist/[[satire|satirist]] [[John Heartfield]]. Laibach concerts have sometimes aesthetically appeared as political rallies. When interviewed, they answer in wry manifestos, showing a paradoxical lust for, and condemnation of, authority.<ref name="VH1"/>

[[Richard Wolfson (musician)|Richard Wolfson]] wrote of the group:

{{cquote|Laibach\'s method is extremely simple, effective and horribly open to misinterpretation. First of all, they absorb the mannerisms of the enemy, adopting all the seductive trappings and symbols of [[Sovereign state|state]] power, and then they exaggerate everything to the edge of parody... Next they turn their focus to highly charged issues &mdash; the West\'s fear of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the power games of the [[European Union|EU]], the analogies between Western [[democracy]] and [[totalitarianism]].<ref>Richard Wolfson, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/09/04/bmlai04.xml "Warriors of weirdness"], \'\'[[The Daily Telegraph]]\'\', 4 September 2003</ref>}}

== Legacy, influence and innovation ==
\'\'\'Martial music\'\'\'

Some early material by Laibach and later [[neoclassical music|neoclassical]] releases by the band, such as 1990\'s \'\'Macbeth\'\' release, were influential on certain artists within the [[martial industrial]] music genre.

\'\'\'Rammstein\'\'\'

The popular German musical group [[Rammstein]] has acknowledged influence by both the aesthetic approach and material of Laibach. When members of Laibach were asked by an interviewer about Rammstein "stealing" from them, they responded that "Laibach does not believe in originality... Therefore, Rammstein could not \'steal\' much from us. They simply let themselves get inspired by our work, which is absolutely a legitimate process. We are glad that they made it. In a way, they have proven once again that a good \'copy\' can make more money on the market than the \'original\'. Anyhow, today we share the territory: Rammstein seem to be a kind of Laibach for adolescents and Laibach are Rammstein for grown-ups"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsmagazine.net/139/laibach.htm|title=Interview: Laibach|accessdate = 2007-04-22}}</ref> Laibach would later provide a remix for the Rammstein single \'\'Ohne Dich\'\'.

==Members==
In 1978, [[Dejan Knez]] formed his first band [[Salte Morale]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/ferfolja.htm |title= Ferfolja|publisher=the Slovenian |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> essentially the first incarnation of Laibach. During the summer of 1980, following the suggestion of Knez\' father, famous Slovenian painter and artist [[Janez Knez]], the band changed the name to Laibach. This incarnation included [[Dejan Knez]], [[Sre\xc4\x8dko Bajda]], [[Andrej Lupinc]], [[Toma\xc5\xbe Hostnik]] and [[Bine Zerko]]. Soon after that, Knez\'s cousin [[Ivan (Jani) Novak]] and Milan Fras joined the band. In the first period Laibach were a quintet, but soon after that they declared that Laibach has only four members \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Vier Personen\xe2\x80\x99. From the mid \xe2\x80\x9880s to mid \xe2\x80\x9890s, the four full-time members were [[Dejan Knez]], Milan Fras, [[Ervin Marko\xc5\xa1ek]] and [[Ivan (Jani) Novak]]. Sometimes those four members of the band operated under their pseudonyms: Dachauer, Keller, Saliger and Eber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nskstate.com/laibach/reviews/laibachkunstderfuge.php |title=Laibach &#93; [ Konzert Fuer Das Kreuzschach Und Vier Schauspieler &#93; |publisher=Nskstate.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> The pseudonym Ivo Saliger was used by the band\'s deceased original singer Toma\xc5\xbe Hostnik and more recently by Ivan Novak.<ref>http://www.laibach.org/tomaz-hostnik-08-11-1961-21-12-1982/</ref><ref>http://www.km-k.at/en/event/ivan-novak-laibach/</ref> Former member Andrej Lupinc have used pseudonym Keller after departing from Laibach.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/artist/Keller+%282%29</ref> From time to time, other musicians, such as [[Oto Rimele]] (from [[La\xc4\x8dni Franz]] band), [[Nikola Sekulovi\xc4\x87]], bass player from the [[Demolition Group]], [[Matej Mr\xc5\xa1nik]] and [[Roman De\xc4\x8dman]], amongst other, have joined Laibach.

He is described as follows: "German-speaking superhuman and would-be dictator is the example of the Hitleresque villain that had so much symbolic importance in the [[Golden Age of comic books]]. The blocky cross on his chest is evocative of the kind of bold symbols used by fascists. Von Bach has the words \'liebe\' (love) and \'hass\' (hate) tattooed on his arms and, in fact, his entire body has been covered with one large tattoo of that dark color that most tattoos become, with his natural flesh color only coming through in the designs on his body".

\'\'\'Meat Beat Manifesto\'\'\', often shortened as \'\'\'Meat Beat\'\'\' or \'\'\'MBM\'\'\', is an [[electronic music]] group originally consisting of [[Jack Dangers]] and Jonny Stephens formed in 1987 in [[Swindon]], United Kingdom. The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with [[techno]], dubstep, [[drum and bass]], [[Intelligent Dance Music|IDM]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], [[Dub music|dub]] and [[jazz fusion]] while touring the world and influencing major acts such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[The Chemical Brothers]] and [[The Prodigy]].<ref name="prefixmag" /> Some of the band\'s earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the [[trip-hop]], [[big beat]], and [[drum and bass]] genres.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web

==History==

===Early years===
Dangers and Stephens had formed UK pop band [[Perennial Divide]] in 1986 with Paul Freeguard and released the first couple of Meat Beat Manifesto singles as a side project. They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement).  The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview.<ref name="fire">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 14 October 2009
}}</ref> The pair then recorded the LP \'\'[[Storm The Studio]]\'\', which got them pigeonholed as an [[industrial music|industrial act]] because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to [[Wax Trax|Wax Trax Records]] for release in the United States.<ref name="prefixmag" /> In response, they released \'\'[[99% (Meat Beat Manifesto album)|99%]]\'\', which was more [[techno music|techno]]-influenced, in May 1990.  In August they released \'\'[[Armed Audio Warfare]]\'\', which was an effort to re-create the lost tracks of the would-be d\xc3\xa9but album.

The band\'s live show was conceived as an intense audio-visual experience, with dancers, led by choreographer Marcus Adams, in costumes designed by artist Craig Morrison<ref name="craig morrison">{{cite web

}}</ref> and video clips accompanying live instruments, sequenced electronic instruments, and live DJing. In the United States, they opened for [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their debut national tour in 1990. In 1991, they performed at [[The Limelight]] in Manhattan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songkick.com/concerts/812355-meat-beat-manifesto-at-limelight |title=Meat Beat Manifesto \xe2\x80\x94 New York \xe2\x80\x94 Limelight \xe2\x80\x94 02 July 1991 |publisher=Songkick |date=2 July 1991 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Watrous |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/04/arts/pop-in-review-692891.html |title=Pop in Review - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=4 July 1991 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> Despite his contributions being nonmusical in nature, Adams was credited as a full band member and appeared in many of the band\'s record sleeves and promo photos until the release of \'\'[[Satyricon (Meat Beat Manifesto album)|Satyricon]]\'\' in 1992. Adams also appeared in several of MBM\'s early videos, such as "Strapdown" and "Psyche-Out".

1992\'s \'\'[[Satyricon (Meat Beat Manifesto album)|Satyricon]]\'\' continued to show Meat Beat adopting a more mainstream electronic sound, crediting influences of such newly popular dance bands as [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Shamen|The Shamen]], and [[The Orb]], all of whom had either remixed or been remixed by MBM. The album produced the hits "Mindstream" and "Circles". "Original Control (Version 2)", renamed "I Am Electro" in later compilations, is the best-known track from the album, featuring samples of recordings from the 1939 World\'s Fair exhibit [[Elektro|Elektro The Robot]], and was the opening song in MBM\'s 2005\xe2\x80\x932006 tour.

===Nothing Records Years, 1994\xe2\x80\x931998===
In 1993 Dangers relocated from England to [[San Francisco]], resulting in Stephens\' departure from the band. At this time, [[Nothing Records]] was founded as an imprint of [[Interscope]] with the purpose of signing industrial and electronic bands to capitalize on the recent success of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Nothing, helmed by [[Trent Reznor]], signed Meat Beat Manifesto and in 1996 the double album \'\'[[Subliminal Sandwich]]\'\' was released. While this album represented MBM\'s major-label debut, it failed to achieve the critical and commercial successes of previous releases. After \'\'Subliminal Sandwich\'\', Dangers put together an album called Original Fire that collected various studio rarities, B-sides, and fan favorites from the early years of MBM, in addition to some new remixes of the material. Also in 1996, the group contributed to the [[AIDS]] benefit album [[Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

In 1997 Dangers recruited drummer Lynn Farmer and multi-instrumentalist John Wilson (MBM member 1995-1998 former Supreme Love Gods) to record and release \'\'[[Actual Sounds + Voices]]\'\' in 1998, which found the group\'s earlier flirtations with [[jazz fusion]] featured more prominently; the record included appearances by saxophonist [[Bennie Maupin]]. The album yielded the single "Prime Audio Soup" which was featured in the film \'\'[[The Matrix]]\'\'. While Jon Wilson left the band prior to the 1998\xe2\x80\x931999 tour, Farmer remains with the band as of Spring 2007. Wilson was replaced by former [[Consolidated (band)|Consolidated]] programmer [[Mark Pistel]], who also remains a contributing member.

During these years, Dangers contributed a pair of remixes to high profile Nine Inch Nails releases \'\'[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer to God]]\'\' and \'\'[["The Perfect Drug" Versions|The Perfect Drug]]\'\'. After the release of \'\'Actual Sounds + Voices\'\', Meat Beat Manifesto was let go by Nothing Records and once more appeared on independent labels.

===\'\'RUOK?\'\', 2000\xe2\x80\x932004===
In 2000, Dangers released a 12" MBM EP of four new songs called \'\'[[Eccentric Objects]]\'\' which demonstrated a shift in Dangers\' output towards simpler song structure and less sonically-dense layering. This evolution in form was full realized two years later, in 2002, with the release of Meat Beat Manifesto\'s seventh full-length album, \'\'[[RUOK?]]\'\'. This album prominently featured Dangers\' newly acquired [[EMS Synthi 100]], as well as guest contributions from turntablist [[Z-Trip]] and [[The Orb]]\'s [[Alex Paterson]]. In 2003 MBM released a remix album for \'\'Storm The Studio\'\', followed by \'\'[[...In Dub]]\'\', a remix album of \'\'RUOK?\'\'.

===\'\'At the Center\'\', 2005\xe2\x80\x932007===
\'\'[[At the Center]]\'\' was released on 29 May 2005. A part of independent label [[Thirsty Ear|Thirsty Ear\'s]] [[Blue Series]], the album is a collaboration between Jack Dangers and jazz musicians Peter Gordon (flute), Dave King (drums), and Craig Taborn (keyboards).<ref name="artistdirect">{{cite web

}}</ref> While Dangers had, in the past, flirted with jazz instrumentation and sampling on a handful of Meat Beat Manifesto tracks, \'\'At the Center\'\' was a marked variation of the expected MBM sound and was more of a one-off experiment than a whole new direction for the band. The album has been well received by many critics, with one reviewer calling it "one of the best albums of the year in \'\'any\'\' genre."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=19388 |title=Jack Dangers: The Mind of Meat Beat Manifesto |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |date= |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> An EP of outtakes, live tracks and a remix titled [[Off-Centre]] was released shortly after.<ref name="igloomag">{{cite web

From 2005 through 2006, MBM launched a worldwide tour, their first since 1999, making use of video sampling technology that allowed the band to trigger video clips in real-time, on two large screens positioned stage front, while the band performed either side-stage or behind the screens, out of the audience\'s view; instead, live video footage of the band performing was displayed onscreen alongside the pre-assembled clips. Many of the video clips used were the sources of samples previously used in various MBM tracks, such as footage of Elektro the Robot and clips from films such as [[Head (film)|\'\'Head\'\']] and [[Dark Star (film)|\'\'Dark Star\'\']].<ref name="wired">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2 May 2009
}}</ref> Dangers and crew performed a wide variety of hits and fan favorites from the entire back catalog, though relatively little of the new jazz fusion material from \'\'At the Center\'\' was played.

In 2006, Meat Beat Manifesto\'s "Suicide" was released on the [[Underworld: Evolution: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|\'\'Underworld: Evolution soundtrack\'\']] and is the only MBM track to date to prominently feature a guitar.

In May 2007 Dangers released a double CD titled \'\'[[Archive Things 1982-88 / Purged]]\'\'.  The first disc contained many early Meat Beat Manifesto experimentations, including demos of what would later become seminal MBM tracks such as "I Got the Fear". The second disc was an instrumental version of the Perennial Divide album, \'\'Purge\'\'.<ref name="brainwashed">{{cite web

MBM\'s ninth studio album, \'\'[[Autoimmune (album)|Autoimmune]]\'\', was released on 7 April 2008 in Europe via Planet Mu Records and on 8 April 2008 in the US and Canada via Metropolis Records.<ref name="sideline">{{cite web

The album has been described as a return to an older, harder MBM sound and as a [[dubstep]] album, though Dangers has stated that he prefers not to fall into any specific genre or category with his work.<ref name="prefixmag">{{cite web

\'\'\'Nitzer Ebb\'\'\' (pronounced [\'n\xc9\xaats\xc9\x99\xc9\xb9 eb] or [\'na\xc9\xaats\xc9\x99\xc9\xb9 eb]) are a British [[electronic body music|EBM]] group formed in 1982 by [[Essex]] school friends [[Bon Harris|Vaughan "Bon" Harris]] (programming, synthesizers, drums, vocals), [[Douglas McCarthy]] (vocals), and David Gooday (drums).

==Band name==
The name of the band was chosen for its harsh, supposedly [[German language|German]] sound.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
It does not carry any meaning in either [[English language|English]] or [[German language|German]].

==Beginnings and \'\'Basic Pain Procedure\'\' (1983)==
Nitzer Ebb began when Bon Harris and David Gooday asked Douglas McCarthy to sing in their band. They shared an interest in witchcraft, talking to trees, and collecting runestones in [[Chelmsford]] and [[Little Baddow]].<ref>Volume Twelve - Winter \'94 Magazine/CD. World\'s End Limited, 1994., p. 190. Mentioned by Douglas McCarthy in an interview by Sam King. Catalog#: V12CD12. ISSN 5-021904-121221.</ref> Their inspiration were bands such as [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]], [[Killing Joke]], and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]].  In August 1983, the group recorded its first demo tape, \'\'Basic Pain Procedure\'\', produced by Chris Piper and Paul Chousmer (Also known for Another Green World, Webcore, Zuvuya and Astralasia). This rare demo tape included eight songs (\xe2\x80\x9cFaded Smiles,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTradition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Home,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStar,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pass,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Book,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCrane,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTrust Ran in Colours\xe2\x80\x9d). The trio began with shows in small local venues, but its arresting stage presence, [[military]]-like image, and energy garnered a growing base of followers and soon led to appearances in larger clubs and concert venues.  Combining the energy of punk with the electronic pulse of DAF, it released its debut [[single (music)|single]] "Isn\'t It Funny How Your Body Works" on 7 January 1985 on its own label, Power of Voice Communications, and its music soon became a fixture on the club scene.  A double-A-sided single, "Warsaw Ghetto"/"So Bright So Strong," followed in 1985 to similar critical and dance floor acclaim. Two further releases, "Let Your Body Learn"/"Get Clean" and "Murderous" were released on Power of Voice Communications before the group signed with [[Mute Records]]. The group\xe2\x80\x99s recordings were licensed to [[Geffen Records]] in the United States, which kept the band on its roster when that label switched distributors from [[Warner Bros. Records]] to [[MCA Records]]. In 2012, Pylon Records re-released Basic Pain Procedure on record and in June 2013 it was released on CD, Tape/USB combo.

==\'\'That Total Age\'\' (1987)==
In May 1987, the group released their debut [[album]] on [[Mute Records]] (Geffen/Warner Bros. in the US), \'\'[[That Total Age]]\'\', which spawned a hit with the pounding [[bassline|bass]] [[rhythm]]s and barked vocals of "Join in the Chant" and "Let Your Body Learn." Both tracks found favour with the Euro club scene and the nascent [[Balearic Beat]] movement.

==\'\'Belief\'\' (1989)==
In 1988, McCarthy and Harris set out to record the perfect electronic album, resulting in the group\xe2\x80\x99s second album, \'\'[[Belief (album)|Belief]]\'\'. Preceded by the classic club track \xe2\x80\x9cControl, I\'m Here,\xe2\x80\x9d that album was released in 1989 and was produced by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], who went on to produce its next three albums and remix other tracks. The band was now down to a core duo of Harris and McCarthy, with [[Julian Beeston]] on drumming duty. Two further singles, \xe2\x80\x9cHearts & Minds\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cShame,\xe2\x80\x9d were released in 1989 with remixes from [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] and [[William Orbit]].

==\'\'Showtime\'\' (1990)==
\'\'Showtime\'\', released in 1990, showed the band moving away from 4/4, 130-bpm stomping dance tracks and explored other musical forms\xe2\x80\x94jazz, rock, blues\xe2\x80\x94while still sounding like itself. The first single, "Lightning Man," became a dance floor anthem with its jazzy clarinet figure and Doug\'s menacing vocals. The song is generally recognized as experimental and pushed the boundaries of industrial music at the time. [[Depeche Mode]] asked the group for support again, this time on the World Violation Tour in the US. [[Depeche Mode]] were frequently seen sporting Nitzer Ebb T-shirts around this period, most notably in the video of the song \xe2\x80\x9c[[Enjoy the Silence]].\xe2\x80\x9d

==\'\'As Is\'\' and \'\'Ebbhead\'\' (1991)==
Exposure to large stadium crowds and the intensity of the whole rock-and-roll business provided a stimulus for the group to start to develop a more rock-oriented sound to their razor-sharp electronic dance music, and 1991\'s \'\'As Is\'\' EP (produced by [[Killing Joke|Killing Joke\'s]] [[Jaz Coleman]], [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Depeche Mode|Depeche Mode\'s]] [[Alan Wilder]], and [[Barry Adamson]]) saw the band adopt a more traditional songwriting approach, and it paved the way for the aforementioned Ebbhead.

\'\'Ebbhead\'\' was released in September 1991 and showcased a new confidence in the band\'s songwriting and production (ably assisted by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] and [[Alan Wilder]]), while the single "I Give to You" was a sweeping orchestral introduction to the band\'s new grand ideas. Two further singles, \xe2\x80\x9cGodhead\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAscend\xe2\x80\x9d combined sampled guitar riffs, throbbing analogue synths, and anthemic choruses. A world tour followed from Autumn 1991 to Summer 1992, spanning the US, Canada, Europe, and Russia.

==\'\'Big Hit\'\' (1995)==
The momentum, progress, and optimism built up around \'\'Ebbhead\'\' was slowly eroded by the group\'s (very expensive) three years recording the follow-up album, \'\'Big Hit\'\'. Drummers were sacked, producers changed, and more. During this period, a schism between Harris and McCarthy began to develop. The group took far too long, and then failed to deliver the album required to elevate them to the level that was promised.

The subsequent world tour saw a new live set-up with Harris on bass, McCarthy on guitar, Jason Payne on drums, and John Napier on guitar and percussion. While still an energetic and involving live act, the shows didn\'t seem to benefit from either real instruments or more musicians on stage, and the arresting visual dynamics of past tours were compromised in favor of a traditional set up. The Nitzer Ebb machine ground to a halt toward the end of the \'\'Big Hit\'\' tour\xe2\x80\x94final dates were advertised then canceled. Although the group never officially split, McCarthy and Harris both went their separate ways. However, the door was effectively left open for Harris and McCarthy to reactivate the band in the future if their differences could be resolved.

==Recent years and reunion==
The band having quietly split, their back catalogue began to appear in DJ sets and mix compilations, and their name would appear in interviews with house and techno producers (which only served to highlight their enduring influence). In recognition of this development, [[NovaMute]] released a [[remix]] series with three [[12-inch single]]s between 2001 and 2004\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cShame\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cJoin in the Chant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cControl, I\'m Here\xe2\x80\x9d/\xe2\x80\x9cLet Your Body Learn,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMurderous\xe2\x80\x9d/Control, I\'m Here.\xe2\x80\x9d The remix of \xe2\x80\x9cLet Your Body Learn\xe2\x80\x9d was particularly fruitful as it was given a radical overhaul by French [[techno]] producer [[Terence Fixmer]], which led first to a friendship and then developed into a recording project between Fixmer and Douglas McCarthy, called simply \'\'[[Fixmer/McCarthy]]\'\'. Live performances (with just a mike and a [[Macintosh]]) around the world followed, which included new versions of Nitzer Ebb songs. This also led to an album released in 2004 as Fixmer/McCarthy, titled \'\'[[Between the Devil...]]\'\', which captured the raw intensity of early Nitzer Ebb.

In late 2005, it was announced that McCarthy and Harris (now residing in the US, and producing and engineering [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[Billy Corgan]]) had begun to talk about the possibility of a Nitzer Ebb reunion. The group toured during 2006, which enlisted the services of drummer [[Kourtney Klein]] producer of Army On The Dance Floor and focused on the more electronic phase of their career, with [[Mute Records]] finally releasing the 2-CD set \'\'Body of Work, 1984\xe2\x80\x931997\'\' in June 2006. A companion piece, \'\'Body Rework\'\', featuring remixes from cutting edge contemporary [[techno]] artists such as Motor, [[Black Strobe]], the Hacker, [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and Robag Wruhme, was also released.

Capitalizing on the success of the 2006 world tour, Nitzer Ebb began work on new material in Los Angeles early in 2007, with a retrospective documentary still in the pipeline. During 2007, Nitzer Ebb continued its trend of replacing drummers as [[Kourtney Klein]] left the band to be replaced by Jason Payne. A first track, "Once You Say," with Depeche Mode songwriter Martin L. Gore on backing vocals, was played in June 2007 by Dave Clarke in his White Noise show on VPRO\'s 3 Voor 12.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26937_0_2_0_C Martin Gore (Depeche Mode) delivers backing vocals on new Nitzer Ebb track \'Once You Say\']</ref> This track, along with "Payroll," were debuted live as Nitzer Ebb played a handful of shows and festivals during 2007. These tracks are featured on Nitzer Ebb\'s newest album, \'\'[[Industrial Complex (album)|Industrial Complex]]\'\'.

McCarthy and Harris reunited up with Jason Payne and producer Flood<ref name="side-line.com">[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=31470_0_2_0_C Flood joins Nitzer Ebb to complete first album in a decade]</ref> to finish up the first new Nitzer Ebb record in over a decade. In the meantime, \'\'[[Fixmer/McCarthy]]\'\' released its second album in June 2008, \'\'Into the Night\'\'.

The band announced a US tour for fall\xe2\x80\x93winter 2009 and were selected as the opening act of the January and February European and Russian dates of Depeche Mode\'s Tour of the Universe in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.depechemode.com/past_tours/tour_of_the_universe/index.html |title=depeche mode dot com |publisher=Depechemode.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>

Nitzer Ebb\'s Ninth album "[[Industrial Complex (album)|Industrial Complex]]" was released in 2010. Reviews were mostly positive with [[NME]] giving it 8 out of 10 stars and saying "[http://www.nme.com/reviews/nitzer-ebb/11082 ..Nitzer Ebb prove they\xe2\x80\x99re far from obsolete.]" and [http://www.lithiummagazine.com/ Lithium Magazine] saying that fans "[http://www.lithiummagazine.com/nitzer-ebb-%E2%80%93-industrial-complex-album-review ...are going to be in for quite a surprise when they hear this new stuff \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s totally bad-ass]."
Spring 2011 saw a very successful albeit short European double-headliner tour with old chums Die Krupps. Final encore of all shows - and an undisputed highlight - was the live presentation of "Machineries of Joy" with Nitzer Ebb being joined on stage by Jurgen Engler and Ralf Dorper.

==Influences and legacy==
{{Unreferenced section|April 2010|date=April 2010}}
Sonically, Nitzer Ebb evoked the sequenced teutonic basslines and barked commands of Virgin-era [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]] in its early days, and took the energy of post-punk bands like [[Killing Joke]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] to create a new aesthetic. As the group grew in confidence and ability, it began to develop the Nitzer Ebb sound\xe2\x80\x94a blend of unusual analogue trickery, minimal song structure, heavy drum beats and percussion, and Douglas McCarthy\'s soulful vocals\xe2\x80\x94either shouted, sung, or spoken. Its sound was captured perfectly in one of the band\xe2\x80\x99s publicity slogans from 1987\xe2\x80\x94"International Funk Aggression"\xe2\x80\x94despite being hard and heavy, its tracks were always very danceable.

Nitzer Ebb\'s musical weapons of choice included the [[Roland SH-101]], a WASP synth, the Roland System 100, the Sequential Pro-One, the classic [[Oberheim Xpander]], and the [[Yamaha TX81Z]], and with this arsenal of analogue, digital FM, and extremely large modular synthesizers, created a sound that still stands up today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Along with a phalanx of [[Akai]] samplers, Nitzer Ebb was able to create a minimal yet expansive and accessible electronic sound, that saw it develop from the sparse electronic basslines and beats of \'\'That Total Age\'\' to the widescreen technicolor funk of \'\'Showtime\'\' and \'\'Ebbhead\'\'.

Nitzer Ebb were seen as a totality, comprising music, art and culture, manifesting itself as a Nitzer Ebb Produkt (an homage to the band [[Kraftwerk]]), which saw all advertisements, fliers, record sleeves, letterheads, T-shirts, and other objects all sharing a collective identity that was heavily influenced by Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] art, Italian [[Futurism]], totalitarian imagery, and [[Expressionism]]. Long-time collaborator Simon Grainger was an unofficial member of Nitzer Ebb and responsible for the austere look and feel of this visual aspect of the band, which aimed to provoke reaction, to critique, and even to poke fun at such stern stark powerful imagery. It also perfectly reflected the uncompromising style of the group\'s music.

Nitzer Ebb was a large influence on [[Detroit Techno]]: [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]] publicly acknowledged this fact before the group opened 2007\xe2\x80\x99s [[Detroit annual electronic music festival]]. A diverse range of DJs and producers, from [[Richie Hawtin]] (featured on Richie Hawtin\xe2\x80\x99s Decks FX & 909 mix CD, on which \xe2\x80\x9cLet Your Body Learn\xe2\x80\x9d was mixed with Hawtin\xe2\x80\x99s own hit \xe2\x80\x9cMinus Orange\xe2\x80\x9d) to [[Tiga (musician)|Tiga]], have also acknowledged the influence that Nitzer Ebb has had on their careers. Indeed, the group\xe2\x80\x99s tracks (usually in their original form) are still heard across the world\'s more discerning dance floors, and have been consistently listed in a wide range of DJs\xe2\x80\x99 Top-10s in the dance-music magazine \'\'[[Mixmag]]\'\'. Another influence can be heard in the first [[Oomph! (album)|self-titled album]] of German band [[Oomph!]], who are considered to be one of the founders of the music style [[Neue Deutsche H\xc3\xa4rte]] represented most famously by another German band [[Rammstein]].

The single "Murderous" has been sampled by other electronic music acts, such as [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]] (on "Now That I Have You") and Kode IV (on "Success").

==Other projects==
In 1989, Nitzer Ebb collaborated with [[Die Krupps]] on an updating of its classic \xe2\x80\x9cWahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn\xe2\x80\x9d single on the \'\'Machineries of Joy\'\' EP. Having worked with [[Alan Wilder]] on 1991\'s \'\'Ebbhead\'\', Douglas McCarthy returned the favor, appearing on Recoil\'s 1992 album \'\'Bloodline\'\', on the electronic reworking of \xe2\x80\x9cFaith Healer,\xe2\x80\x9d the [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]] classic.  McCarthy also appeared on Recoil\'s \'\'Unsound Methods\'\' album in 1997, providing vocals for the tracks "Incubus" and "Stalker."

McCarthy appeared with [[Empirion]] at 1997\'s [[Tribal Gathering]] (a performance that was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]) before embarking on a new career in video production. Since working with Terence Fixmer, he has lent his unique vocals to collaborations with Motor, [[KLOQ (band)]], Warren Suicide, a duet with [[Sarah Blackwood|Sarah "Client B" Blackwood]] on [[Client (band)|Client]]\'s "Suicide Sister", and [[Die Krupps]] on another reworking of \xe2\x80\x9cWahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn.\xe2\x80\x9d Homotronic\'s ironic "U Look Like a Gay" also features an uncredited performance from McCarthy. McCarthy has released material in collaboration with DJ [[Terence Fixmer]] as [[Fixmer/McCarthy]].  McCarthy released a new album called "Kill Your Friends," in November 2012 on Los Angeles-based label Pylon Records.

Bon Harris began the Maven project in 2001 in Los Angeles, California, and has worked with [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]]/[[Billy Corgan]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], and [[Depeche Mode]]. In 2006, Maven released "Mary" as a 3-song digital bundle including the songs "Candidate" and "Silverbirds." Three additional songs were released via its MySpace player: "In Still Love," "Hard on for Love" (a cover version of [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] featuring [[Marilyn Manson]]), and "Jesus, Mary, and Jennifer Louise."  The current status of the Maven project is unknown.

The song "I\'m Undone" was used in a Dark Souls II trailer.

{{lowercase|title=ohGr}}
\'\'\'ohGr\'\'\' is a [[synthpop]] band formed by [[Nivek Ogre]], of [[Skinny Puppy]], and musician/engineer [[Mark Walk]]. Although the pedigree of the group\'s members might suggest otherwise, early ohGr releases differed in sound to its related [[Industrial music|industrial]] bands, drawing more on [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[synthpop]] influences, incorporating more conventional structures and a lighter tone. However, from [[Devils in my Details]] onwards, ohGr has taken to a more [[abrasive]], [[non-linear]] flavour of [[electro-industrial]].

==History==
The band was officially formed in 2000, although the material for the first album, \'\'[[Welt (album)|Welt]]\'\' dates back to the mid-nineties, having been held up due to legal trouble with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. [[W.E.L.T.]] was actually originally the title of the group (an [[acronym]] of "When Everyone Learns Truth"), until it was discovered that in the interval it had been taken by a Californian punk band. [[Al Jourgensen]] was also originally involved (who had the then band\'s name tattooed in anticipation of the project), and only one track he collaborated on has been leaked to the public, titled "Noreen". The music of that song later became [[industrial metal]] group [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]\'s "[[The Fall (Ministry song)|The Fall]]", on their 1996 album \'\'[[Filth Pig]]\'\'.

==Touring==

The band toured in 2001 to support the release of their debut album \'\'[[Welt (album)|Welt]]\'\'; the live band consisted of [[Nivek Ogre]], [[Tim Skold]] (bass), [[cEvin Key]] (drums and keyboards), [[Loki der Quaeler]] (keyboards), and [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]] (guitar). 2003 saw the release of a follow up, \'\'[[SunnyPsyOp]]\'\' (a play on the phrase "[[Fried egg|sunny side up]]" and military [[Psychological Operations|PsyOps]]). There were initially plans to tour for \'\'SunnyPsyOp\'\', with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] in a festival type arrangement. These plans fell through, although much of the material from the second album had already been played live on the \'\'[[Welt (album)|Welt]]\'\' tour.

2008 saw Ohgr on tour throughout the U.S. and Canada in support of the album \'\'[[Devils in my Details]]\'\' with a live band including William Morrison returning on guitar, drummer [[Justin Bennett]] and keyboardist Jeff "Squigg" Smith.<ref>"[http://www.litany.net/archive/?month=12&year=2011 Litany: Ohgr Tour News]"</ref>

In late 2011 OhGr announced a December 2011 West Coast USA and Canada tour consisting of 9 dates with direct support by fellow [[Metropolis Records]] artist [[Left Spine Down]].<ref>"[http://wwww.metropolis-records.com/news/?id=79 ohGr with Left Spine Down live dates announced!]"</ref><ref>"[http://coma-online.com/?p=8140 :News: Left Spin Down {{sic|nolink=y|Annouce|expected=Announce}} Tour in Support of ohGr]"</ref>

==Videos==

ohGr has released three promotional videos, all directed by [[William Morrison (director)|William Morrison]]. The first was a [[stop-motion]] creation for the track "Cracker".  The second was a live performance of "Minus", filmed by Michael Condo at several venues from the 2001 tour. The [[3 (number)|third]] was for "MaJiK", from the second album; this also employed [[stop-motion]], and was a [[collaboration]] with artist [[Thomas Kuntz]]. "Cracker" and "MaJiK" have both been played occasionally on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (television)|Fuse]]. All three have been available through ohGr\'s website, and "MaJiK" appeared on the audio CD for \'\'[[SunnyPsyOp]]\'\', albeit with some serious technical glitches. You can also see and hear a partial live performance from the 2001 tour on the short film John E. Dirt by director Bill Draheim.

==Present==
ohGr\'s third album titled \'\'[[Devils in my Details]]\'\' was released on October 17, 2008 in Germany,<ref>[http://www.spv.de/scripts/kcover_d.asp?nummer=92792&label=ns SPV]</ref> October 20 in the United Kingdom, and October 21 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.devilsinmydetails.com devilsinmydetails.com]</ref> ohGr toured in support of the album release during the autumn of 2008.<ref>[http://litany.net/ Litany.net], September 1, 2008 entry</ref> At Comic-Con 2008, Ogre announced that [[Bill Moseley]] will be contributing to the new ohGr album, as a result of them becoming friends through [[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]. It was tentatively revealed in a [[Online chat|chat]] with the band that an album of [[B-side]]s from [[Devils in my Details]] (entitled "D-Sides") and an album of unreleased material from the 1990s (entitled "Dfault") was due to be released.<ref>[http://litany.net/ Litany.net], October 5, 2008 Entry.</ref> In October 2009 a [[Hyperlink|link]] to [http://www.wdihtf.com www.wdihtf.com] appeared on [[Skinny Puppy]]\'s website. When users sign up to the [[mailing list]] they receive a [[Hyperlink|link]] to the song COLLIDOSKOPE which starts with many different voices saying "Welcome to Collidoskope".

As of May 10, 2011, ohGr has released a new studio album, \'\'[[unDeveloped]]\'\'<ref>http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+720</ref>
.  The album was a collaboration with [[Mark Walk]], with whom the previous album was created. Also on the album is the actual audio from the [[9-1-1|911]] call reporting [[Michael Jackson]]\'s death (Track titled \'\'crash\'\').

\'\'\'The Retrosic\'\'\' is a [[Germany|German]] [[Electro-Industrial]] project.

==History==

The Retrosic project was born in April 2001 with the release of the debut \'\'Prophecy\'\'. The Retrosic\'s second release, \'\'Messa da Requiem\'\', reached the top of the [[Deutsche Alternative Charts]] in 2002, and was named "Album of the Year" by the Dutch Alternative Charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gothtronic.com/?page=23&band=95 |title=Retrosic, The (int) |accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref>

The Retrosic\'s third album \'\'God of Hell\'\' saw the line-up expand to a full band, seeing the incorporation of elements as diverse as soprano vocals, Indian flutes, trombones and oriental rhythms into the project\'s sound.  Two years later, \'\'Nightcrawler\'\' was released, introducing breakbeat rhythms and guitar sounds into the group\'s sonic palette.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=38385885 |title=The Retrosic (Myspace)}}</ref>

These releases earned a number of accolades in the scene press, but despite this, the project had not yet performed live at this stage.  They finally made their live debut at the 2007 [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] festival.  This performance was recorded for future release as a live DVD.

\'\'\'Rotersand\'\'\' is a German [[electronic music]] act, formed in September 2002 by musician/producer Gun and singer Rascal with dance music producer/DJ Krischan J.E. Wesenberg joining them shortly after. Being referred to by the band itself as \'\'Industrial Pop\'\' Rotersand\'s music can generally be described as [[Futurepop]].

==History==

Prior to Rotersand, Gun and Rasc had collaborated on various other projects, most notably Gun as one producer and Rasc as one member of the band [[The Fair Sex]]. Rotersand\'s debut release was the \'Merging Oceans\' EP in 2003, followed by their debut album \'\'[[Truth Is Fanatic]]\'\'.  In 2005, they released the single \'Exterminate Annihilate Destroy\', a precursor to their second album \'\'[[Welcome To Goodbye]]\'\'.  Both of which reached No.1 in the [[Deutsche Alternative Charts]] DAC.  The third Rotersand album, \'\'[[1023 (Album)|1023]]\'\', was released in 2007.
[[File:Rotersand e tropolis 2014 -39.jpg|170x240px|thumbnail|left|Rascal Nikov @ E-Tropolis 2013 ]]
The band has toured Europe with [[Assemblage 23]] and both Europe and the US with [[Covenant (band)|Covenant]], it played at [[Dark City Festival]] and was one of the headlining acts at [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] 2006. [[Mark Jackson (musician)|Mark Jackson]] of [[VNV Nation]] joined them on stage at the [[M\'era Luna Festival]] in Hildesheim Germany in August 2006, and the band appeared twice at the [[Wave Gotik Treffen]].

After the discontinuation of Dependent Records in 2008 the band signed to Trisol Records in 2008 and released the single "I cry", which was taken from the \'1023\' album. It also contains a DVD with live and interview material and reached the DAC\'s No.1 shortly after its release.

2009 saw the release of the newest Rotersand MCD \'\'[[War On Error]]\'\' a teaser for the band\'s album \'\'[[Random Is Resistance]]\'\',<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=43195_0_2_0_C Rotersand returns with \'War On Error\' MCD on Trisol]</ref> which was released in October of that year.

\'\'\'Sheep on Drugs\'\'\' are a [[Great Britain|British]] [[techno]] / [[dance-punk]] [[musical ensemble|music group]], formed by Duncan X [aka King Duncan] ([[singing|vocals]]) and Lee Fraser [aka Dead Lee] ([[guitar]]/[[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) and currently composed of Fraser and Johnny Borden ([[vocals]]/[[keyboards]]). 

==Biography==
Originally classified as part of the [[rave]] movement, the [[duet (music)|duo]] emerged in the early 1990s with a string of [[single (music)|singles]], including "Motorbike," "15 Minutes of Fame" and "Track X" (later [[cover version|covered]] by [[Grace Jones]] as "Sex Drive"). "15 Minutes of Fame" reached the lower reaches of the [[UK Singles Chart]] as did "From A To H And Back Again".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Their [[Gareth Jones (music producer)|Gareth Jones]] [[record producer|produced]] debut [[album]], \'\'Greatest Hits\'\', was released on [[Island Records]] in 1993 to some acclaim from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[music journalism|music press]].{{Who|date=April 2009}} However, with their [[Grand Guignol]] style stage shows, and a musical mixture of sleazy rock, hard techno and [[Punk rock|punk]] [[nihilism]], SoD found themselves pigeonholed as an [[industrial rock|industrial]] band.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  Their 1994 follow-up album, \'\'...On Drugs\'\' was a commercial and critical disappointment.

<blockquote>"For the \'On Drugs\' album, it was basically me and Duncan locked in a room, with no guidance about what direction we were to take it in, no producer. Markus Dravs, who did the production for that album, he\'s a brilliant artist in his own right, but he wasn\'t the producer we needed. He was just brought into the studio to mix, it wasn\'t like he was an active part of the team, so they fucked that up. So, no wonder the second album wasn\'t as commercial as they were expecting, because they didn\'t give us any guidance," according to Lee.<ref name = sorted>

After being dropped by Island, the band independently released two [[Extended play|EPs]]: \'\'Suck\'\' in 1994 and \'\'Strapped for Cash\'\' in 1995.  The band was then signed to [[Martin Atkins]]\' [[Invisible Records]] and headed to the [[United States]].   With Invisible, they released the two EPs as \'\'Double Trouble\'\' in 1996, their third [[recording studio|studio]] album, \'\'One for the Money\'\' and a [[remix]] collection, \'\'Never Mind the Methadone\'\' in 1997, and a live [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]], \'\'Two for the Show\'\' in 1998. By this time, they had tired of their situation in the States and were unsatisfied with Invisible.<ref name = sorted/> [[Frontman]] Duncan X departed Sheep on Drugs shortly afterwards to become a professional tattooist (though he does perform live with the band on rare occasions).  Fraser continued his relationship with Invisible Records, releasing two more albums as \'Bagman\' and was briefly a member of Atkins\' bands [[Pigface]] and [[The Damage Manual]], usually under the moniker "Lee 303".  Fraser revived the group in 2002 with himself as the frontman and released a new album, \'\'F**K\'\', on Invisible in 2005.  A [[greatest hits|best of]] [[compilation album]] called \'\'Best of a Bad Bunch\'\' was released in 2006.

After the release of \'\'F**K\'\', Lee Fraser met and began working with Johnny Borden, herself a singer and musician working within similar circles. Johnny was soon brought on board as Lee\'s partner in Sheep On Drugs\' new 21st century incarnation and they began gigging, developing new material which was released on their new album \'\'MEDICATION TIME\'\' (released digitally on December 6, 2010). The album will be released by a French record label on physical CDs in 2011 to accompany a tour in February.

\'\'\'Spahn Ranch\'\'\' was an [[electro-industrial]] group from [[Los Angeles]]. Active from 1992 to 2000, the band was well known in a subgenre of industrial music for its fusion of [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]], [[Industrial Music|industrial]] and [[gothic music|gothic]] music.

==History==
The band was formed in 1992 by [[Matt Green (musician)|Matt Green]] and his New York\xe2\x80\x93based collaborator, Rob Morton. That same year, they signed to [[Cleopatra Records]] and released a self-titled, four-song [[Extended play|EP]], with vocals supplied by Scott "Chopper" Franklin (later to become bass player for [[The Cramps]]).

In 1993, they added vocalist [[Athan Maroulis]] and recorded their debut album, \'\'Collateral Damage\'\'. Their second album, \'\'The Coiled One\'\', appeared two years later in the midst of Morton leaving the band due to creative and logistical differences. After his departure, the line-up was expanded to include [[Christian Death]] drummer David Glass, Screams for Tina guitarist Kent Bancroft, and Tubalcain  drummer Harry Lewis. This offered a beginning of the fuller, more diverse, dark electro-industrial sound that Spahn Ranch would continue to pursue. By 1997, Spahn Ranch had pared themselves down to the three-piece unit of Green, Maroulis and Lewis.

Spahn Ranch continued to release albums throughout the late 1990s.  \'\'Architecture\'\', released in 1997, featured contributions from [[Killing Joke]]/[[Prong (band)|Prong]] bassist [[Paul Raven]] and [[Rockats]]/[[Nancy Sinatra]] guitarist [[Danny B. Harvey]]. This album took an even more experimental approach to the Spahn Ranch sound, incorporating elements of drum and bass, dub and for the first time, live guitar parts. \'\'Beat Noir\'\', in 1998, followed a similar path even further and included work with [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]/[[Love and Rockets (band)|Love & Rockets]] bassist [[David J]].

The band regularly toured throughout North America during their existence with the likes of [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Front 242]], [[Switchblade Symphony]] and [[Apoptygma Berzerk]].  Spahn Ranch also made a couple of European treks prior to their demise as a group in 2000.

\'\'Closure\'\', their final album, was recorded in 2000 and released in 2001.

\'\'\'Suicide Commando\'\'\' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[electro-industrial]] act created by Johan van Roy in 1986.<ref name="bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.suicidecommando.be/sc1/index2.html |title=Biography |publisher=Suicide Commando |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref>

== History ==

Johan van Roy, Suicide Commando\'s only member, began experimenting with electronic music in 1986. Three years later he released his first tape under the moniker Suicide Commando, and made an appearance on the [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] compilation, \'\'Electronic\'\'. As van Roy continued self-releasing tapes, he landed more compilation appearances on \'\'Rotation II\'\' and \'\'[[Induktion, Varianz und Deren Folgen]]\'\', both released by Kugelblitz records.

1994 saw Suicide Commando\'s first CD, \'\'Critical Stage\'\', released on the German label Off-Beat. Shortly after, in 1995, Suicide Commando released \'\'Stored Images\'\', which contains to date one of van Roy\'s most popular songs,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} \'\'See You in Hell\'\'.

1996 was the ten-year anniversary of Suicide Commando, and with it came the release of \'\'Contamination\'\', as well as the limited boxed version, which contained a bonus 3" compact disc featuring previously unreleased material. \'\'Contamination\'\' was released a year later in North America by the now defunct Electronic Death Trip records.

In 1998, Suicide Commando released the album \'\'Construct-Destruct\'\' and its sister release, \'\'Reconstruction\'\' including the songs \'\'Desire\'\' and \'\'Better Off Dead\'\', the former of which was picked up by Possessive Blindfold Records for distribution in North America with bonus tracks.

Van Roy was one of the founders of the [[dependent (record label)|dependent]] label in 1999. It was on this new label that Suicide Commando\'s next releases, two singles and one [[Extended play|EP]]: \'\'Hellraiser\'\', \'\'Comatose Delusion\'\', and \'\'Love Breeds Suicide\'\', accompanied Suicide Commando\'s 2000 release, \'\'Mindstrip\'\', which reached the number one spot on the [[Deutsche Alternative Charts]]. Later the \'\'Mindstrip\'\' album was licensed and released in North America by [[Metropolis Records]].

In 2002 Suicide Commando released the DCD \'\'Anthology\'\' on [[dependent (record label)|dependent]], a "best of" compilation, including the songs "Hellraiser", "See You in Hell", "Love Breeds Suicide", and offered some exclusive new remixes and rare versions.

For Suicide Commando\'s next release, \'\'Axis of Evil\'\', a special edition double single called \'\'Face of Death\'\' was released beforehand.  The regular edition of the single continues to sell, and \'\'Axis of Evil\'\' was voted album of the year (2003) by the Deutsche Alternative Charts. In 2004 Suicide Commando released another limited edition double single, \'\'Cause of Death: Suicide + One Nation under God\'\'.

In 2006, Suicide Commando returned with the album \'\'Bind, Torture, Kill\'\' (also available as limited edition including a bonus disc, poster and sticker), featuring the single \'\'Godsend + Menschenfresser\'\', released on [[Noise Terror Productions]]. The album once again reached the top position in several alternative charts across the world and got voted \'\'album of the month\'\' in the German [[Orkus]] magazine.

Released in 2007, one year after the band\'s 20th anniversary, the \'\'X20\'\' boxset included 3 CDs (one \'\'[[remix]]\'\' CD, one \'\'best of\'\' CD and the \'\'Fuck You Bitch\'\' EP) and Suicide Commando\'s very first live DVD. The special remix CD and the best of album were later released as separate discs by [[Metropolis Records]].
At the end of 2007 Suicide Commando returned with the song \'\'Hate me\'\', their first new material since the \'\'bind torture kill\'\' album, released on the \'\'noise terror volume 2\'\' [[Sampler (album)|sampler]] on NTP/Dependent.

In 2009 SUICIDE COMMANDO signed a deal with Out Of Line label and  [[Metropolis Records]].

End of 2010 a 4th single "death cures all pain" was taken from the successful "implements of hell" album and was released on Out Of Line.

\'\'\'Velvet Acid Christ\'\'\' (\'\'\'VAC\'\'\') is an [[electro-industrial]] band based in [[Denver, Colorado]]. The band was formed in 1990 by lead vocalist, musician, and producer Bryan Erickson, and later featured various ex-members of [[Toxic Coma]]. The project gained limited popularity in Europe\'s [[Underground music|underground]] [[nightclub]] scene during the mid-1990s with the compilation [[Church of Acid]] (1996) before expanding into other markets in the [[gothic rock|goth]] and industrial [[subculture]]s. The band\'s discography includes 11 albums, the latest being Maldire (2012) and Subconscious Landscapes (2014).

==Musical style==

The majority of the band\'s work is categorized among the genres of [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Gothic rock|Gothic]], [[electro-industrial]], and [[Electronic Body Music|EBM]]. The band\'s tone ranges between angry, upbeat, sad, and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]. The band\'s lyrical content offers a varied focus, including such topics as [[IRC]], love, hate, depression, [[misanthropy]], [[recreational drug use|drugs]], and religion. Erickson is the group\'s main songwriter.

Much of Velvet Acid Christ\'s [[musical composition]] has been produced with synthesizers and computer software (see: [[Computer music]]).  Other instruments used by the band include [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] such as [[drum machine]]s and electric guitars with [[effects pedal]]s.<ref name="gear">{{cite news |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041010222542/www.velvetacidchrist.com/gear.htm |publisher=Velvet Acid Christ Website |title=VAC: Gear |date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> [[Sampling (music)|Sampling]], which is the use of sound clips as part of a new recording, is another technique commonly employed by the band.

===Influences===
The band cites many musical influences, including among many others [[Aphex Twin]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Cocteau Twins]], [[The Cure]], [[Siouxsie and The Banshees]], and [[Astral Projection]].

==History==

===Early projects, early changes, and first albums (1990\xe2\x80\x931995)===
In the early 1990s, Erickson and Grigory, both residents of Colorado, brought together their shared interest in creating music to record a series of [[Demo (music)|demos]].  With the addition of Gary Slaughter and Chris Workman, the group attempted several bands, including Disease Disco Factory, a parody of then-popular Dance group [[C+C Music Factory]]. Following a turbulent period for Erickson and Slaughter, Workman left the group.<ref>Primary section source. [http://web.archive.org/web/20041010224540/www.velvetacidchrist.com/timeline.htm VAC: Time Line] Velvet Acid Christ Website Accessed 2007-11-01</ref> Slaughter and Erickson experimented with two new side-projects, Cyber Christ and Vortex. Cyber Christ explored a harsh and melancholy sound that was a sharp contrast to the group\'s other projects. When Erickson discovered that the term "Cyber Christ" had been used in the 1992 film \'\'[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]\'\', he renamed the band \'\'Velvet Acid Christ\'\' "in honor of a bad [[LSD|acid]] trip".<ref name="redscreams">{{cite news |url=http://members.shaw.ca/Redscreams/VAC/about.htm |publisher=Velvet Acid Christ Fanlisting |title=Velvet Acid Christ Website // About |date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> The Vortex project was merged into Velvet Acid Christ to form one body of work.

In 1994, Workman returned to assist with the band\'s self-produced Gothic-styled demo tape, \'\'Fate\'\'. Given encouraging response from friends, the band followed up with other self-produced albums, 1994\'s \'\'Pestilence\'\', a dance-oriented album, and 1995\'s \'\'[[Neuralblastoma]]\'\', a harder-sounding album.

Erickson, along with friends and minor contributors Steve Bird and Dan Olson, started the brief-lived [[record label]] Electro Death Trip (EDT) Records to better promote these recordings.  In 1995, the three began distributing hand-made CD copies of \'\'Fate\'\', \'\'Pestilence,\'\' and \'\'Neuralblastoma\'\' for resale in local music shops.

===Label interest, touring, and a troubled rise (1996\xe2\x80\x932000)===
[[File:Velvet acid christ church.jpg|thumb|left|Cover art for 1996\'s \'\'[[Church of Acid]]\'\', which was well received in Europe.]]
Slaughter and Workman temporarily left the band during the first half of 1996 as Erickson continued the project alone, handing out copies of Velvet Acid Christ\'s recordings to industry representatives, including musician [[Bill Leeb]] of industrial pioneer [[Front Line Assembly]]. Leeb passed the music to Thorsten Stroht, a media promoter with European label Off-Beat Records. Off-Beat [[A&R]] negotiated a deal with the band.

For their first Off-Beat release, the group submitted 1996\'s \'\'[[Church of Acid]]\'\', a compilation of selected tracks from Velvet Acid Christ\'s first three albums with an additional two new tracks, "Disflux" and "Futile".  \'\'Church of Acid\'\' was well received in Europe, and "Futile" became a regularly played track in many [[nightclub]]s across the continent.<ref name="lastsigh">{{cite news

The band\'s next album, \'\'Calling Ov the Dead\'\', was rejected by Off-Beat for not sounding edgy enough.,<ref name="lyrics">{{cite news |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041010223954/www.velvetacidchrist.com/lyrics.htm |publisher=Velvet Acid Christ |title=VAC: Lyrics |date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> prompting Slaughter\'s permanent departure. With the assistance of Bird and Olson, the band addressed the label\'s concerns and released \'\'Calling Ov the Dead\'\' in late 1997, with American distribution following through Pendragon in 1998. In the process, Erickson had accumulated a substantial financial [[debt]].

With a line-up consisting of Erickson, Stroht and German musician Ingo Beitz, the band toured Europe in 1998 with Off-Beat label-mate [[Suicide Commando]], which attracted the attention of [[Metropolis Records]], the largest industrial label in United States. The parent label of Pendragon, Metropolis distributed the album \'\'Neuralblastoma\'\', as a partnership that would endure.

Velvet Acid Christ spent the majority of 1999 in the studio, first collaborating with Germany\'s [[Funker Vogt]] on a remix [[Extended play|EP]] entitled \'\'Velvet Acid Christ Vs Funker Vogt: The Remix Assault\'\', then shifting to Velvet Acid Christ\'s next full-length recording, \'\'[[Fun With Knives]]\'\'. With Workman an occasional contributor, Erickson sought production assistance on \'\'Fun With Knives\'\' from the bands Luxt and 4th New Army. \'\'Fun with Knives\'\', released by Metropolis and new Off-Beat sub-label [[dependent (record label)|dependent]], became the band\'s best-selling album.<ref name="lyrics"/> Sales were propelled by the [[Single (music)|singles]] "Decypher" and "Fun with Drugs", and by the track "Slut", which featured vocals from Luxt\'s Anna Christine.

In spite of the success of the band, stress had led Erickson into depression and increased drug abuse, which channeled into the creation of the band\'s next album, \'\'[[Twisted Thought Generator]]\'\'. Simultaneously, the band toured Europe with industrial acts Project X and [[Stromkern]] and toured the United States and Canada with bands Din_Fiv and [[Haujobb]]. The line-up of the band during this period was unstable. Workman, citing a conversion to Christianity, resigned from the band with a request that his name be retracted from all previous albums. The first leg of the European tour consisted of Erickson, Bird and Stroht; the second leg, Erickson and Olson. The North American tour was performed by Erickson, Stroht and drummer Paul Lipman. With various contributors, Erickson completed \'\'Twisted Thought Generator\'\'. Due to lingering disputes, he withdrew the band from Dependent Records and submitted the album to Metropolis.

===A change of pace, new early material, and beyond (2001\xe2\x80\x93)===
Erickson placed Velvet Acid Christ on a short hiatus in 2001, as he abandoned his dependence on drugs in favour of exercise and a [[Veganism|vegan]] [[raw foodist]] diet. Newly clean, Erickson created the 2003 album \'\'[[Hex Angel|Hex Angel: Utopia/Dystopia]]\'\'. Though critical response was mixed, \'\'Hex Angel: Utopia/Dystopia\'\' ranked #1 on Germany\'s Deutsche Alternative Charts (DAC) for four weeks after its release, and the album\'s single "Pretty Toy" reached #18 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Alternative Chart during the same year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} The album also marked the band\'s short-lived return to Dependent Records.

Erickson spent 2004 releasing and reissuing some of Velvet Acid Christ\'s earliest material. With the four-volume compilation series \'\'Between the Eyes\'\', the band published a collection of its singles and [[B-side]]s, then followed with subsequent re-releases of \'\'Fate\'\' (\'\'Vol. 2\'\'), \'\'Pestilence\'\' (\'\'Vol. 3\'\'), and \'\'Neuralblastoma\'\' (\'\'Vol. 4\'\'). The band also offered free MP3 downloads of \'\'[[Twisted Thought Generator|Dimension 8]]\'\' and \'\'[[Oblivion Interface]]\'\' on its website until early 2005. \'\'Dimension 8\'\', which had been available as a hidden bonus on \'\'Twisted Thought Generator\'\', and \'\'Oblivion Interface\'\' (informally known as \'\'Between the Eyes, Vol. 5\'\') provided fans with previously unheard work from the Cyber Christ-Vortex era of 1991\xe2\x80\x931994.

In 2005, Erickson collaborated with guitarist Todd Loomis on a new album, \'\'[[Lust for Blood (album)|Lust for Blood]]\'\', which was released on September 26, 2006. With \'\'Lust for Blood\'\', the crew labored intensively to create a new overall sound while maintaining the band\'s original characteristics. Following its release, \'\'Lust for Blood\'\' ranked at the top of Germany\'s DAC for four weeks; the album\'s single release, [[Wound (song)|"Wound"]], ranked on the DAC\'s singles chart for eight weeks<ref>[http://www.adream.de/files/charts_39.pdf Deutsche Alternative Charts 29.09.2006], 2006-09-28, retrieved 2009-11-25</ref> and held the #1 position for four weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

In October 2009, Velvet Acid Christ, Erickson wrote most of the LP, Loomis did a little work on it and was busy working on his project "The Twilight Garden", released \'\'[[The Art of Breaking Apart]]\'\'. This LP was a tribute to bands like Current 93 and Death in June and brought VAC many new fans while making the others angry.

In 2010\xe2\x80\x932011, Bryan Erickson teamed up with William Anderson of Louisiana. William did a ton of sampling, Bryan made a bunch of VAC B-sides and turned them into Toxic Coma tracks. The project is very old with a revolving door of members, again Bryan being the main constant. This LP fuses the techno sound of \'\'Fun With Knives\'\' and the brutal black humor of Toxic Coma. This VAC side project is known as Toxic Coma \'\'Satan Rising\'\', on Metropolis Records.<ref>Toxic Coma at Discogs.</ref> Erickson then began to write more music for future VAC LPs.

In October 2012, Velvet Acid Christ released their latest LP entitled Maldire. The release marked a return to the dark electronic sound. Erickson formed a live band and toured extensively (2012-2014) to support the album. A new album entitled Subconscious Landscapes will be released October 28, 2014.

}}

\'\'\'VNV Nation\'\'\' is an English/Irish [[electronic music]] band originally from [[Dublin]] and [[Essex]] and now based in [[Hamburg]], Germany. They combine elements of [[synthpop]], [[Trance music|trance]] and [[electronic body music]] (EBM). The members are [[Ronan Harris]] and [[Mark Jackson (musician)|Mark Jackson]]. The "VNV" in the name stands for "Victory Not Vengeance", in keeping with the group\'s [[motto]], "One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret."<ref>[http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/history.htm VNVNation.com \'\'History\'\' section]</ref>

==History==
The group\'s first album, \'\'[[Advance and Follow]]\'\', was released in 1995. This was a mixture of danceable synthesizer melodies and harsh electronic beats firmly in the tradition of middle-era EBM, supplemented with elements of [[orchestra|orchestral music]]. Their next release, \'\'[[Praise the Fallen]]\'\' in 1998, continued largely in this vein, and they began to enjoy a larger degree of commercial success.

During that time Harris also wrote for the online magazine \'\'[[Side-Line]]\'\' of which he was the webmaster until 1999.

===\'\'Empires\'\' (1999)===
\'\'[[Empires (VNV Nation album)|Empires]]\'\', released in 1999, was their breakthrough album, gaining them widespread commercial success (topping the German DAC charts for seven weeks) and increasing the visibility of the genre. While in the vein of their previous two works, \'\'Empires\'\' expanded the bombastic synthesizer lines and incorporated tighter song organisation with verses and catchy choruses. Furthermore, the harsher \'sheet metal instrumentals\' of albums like \'\'Praise the Fallen\'\' were largely gone, and the music as a whole was far more complex with multiple-layered arpeggios and pads. This album was composed using only one synthesizer (the popular [[Access Virus]]) and two (rather low-quality) samplers.

===\'\'Futureperfect\'\' (2002)===
Their 2002 album, \'\'[[Futureperfect]]\'\', while retaining many industrial elements represented a departure in many ways, largely away from EBM and towards synthpop, even incorporating some elements of [[trance music|trance]]. Some neoclassical instrumental pieces were included in the album. This shift caused their mainstream popularity to increase still further, but alienated some of their fans who preferred their earlier harsher and darker sound. Nonetheless, they embarked on several highly successful world tours in 2002 and 2003. Notably, the album was produced using mainly software synthesizers instead of hardware synthesizers. It was the first VNV Nation album made entirely with software synthesizers.

===\'\'Matter + Form\'\' (2005)===
Their 2005 album, \'\'[[Matter + Form]]\'\', expanded on the soundscape established with \'\'Futureperfect\'\' while also adding a harder and more mechanical sound in some songs. Notable for this harder-edged sound was the first single "Chrome". Also of note is the lack of effects applied to the vocals, a departure from previous albums, which allows Harris\' voice more space in the mix. There were also several songs with a softer and more pensive theme. Some songs even had a slight "rock" feeling to them, mostly from how drum sequences and bass lines were arranged, the most obvious example being the final song, "Perpetual". The assortment of instruments used in the production was much larger than on previous albums and everything from the Access Virus to a custom-made analogue modular synthesizer and several software synthesizers were used. This album was also the first time the band used an outside producer.

===\'\'Judgement\'\' (2007)===
VNV Nation\'s next studio album was \'\'[[Judgement (VNV Nation album)|Judgement]]\'\', released on 4 April 2007. Containing ten tracks, it continued the evolution of the VNV Nation sound.

On 25 April 2007, at the sold-out show at The Metro in Chicago, Harris stated that the rumours about \'\'Judgement\'\' being the last album were false and that more was to come and that \'\'Judgement\'\' was just the beginning.

At the alternative electronic music festival [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] in [[Bradford]] on 26 August 2007, just after the [[murder of Sophie Lancaster]], Harris dedicated the song "Illusion" to her and contacted the family soon afterwards to offer his condolences.<ref>{{YouTube|-JWd-XRYVN4|VNV Nation \xe2\x80\x93 Illusion}} Infest 2007.

===\'\'Reformation 1\'\' (2009)===
Two years after \'\'Judgement\'\', the box set \'\'[[Reformation 1]]\'\' was released in Europe on 24 April 2009. Its US release was on 12 May.

===\'\'Of Faith, Power and Glory\'\' (2009)===
The next album, \'\'[[Of Faith, Power and Glory]]\'\' was mentioned on the band\'s MySpace blog. Harris confirmed to \'\'Side-Line\'\' that they were aiming for late April to release the album, which would be titled \'\'Of Faith, Power and Glory\'\', or as Harris described it: "The 3 things that people desire and which can make you or destroy you!"<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=38780_0_2_0_C VNV Nation on demoing \'Of Faith, Power and Glory\' album]</ref>

Due to the release of "[[Reformation 1]]" in mid-April, the release of the album was postponed; it appeared in the US on CD and in the [[iTunes Store]] on 23 June 2009, and in Europe on 19 June 2009.<ref>[http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/products.htm \'\'VNV NATION OFFICIAL HOMEPAGE\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 "Products" July 3 2009]</ref>

===\'\'Crossing the Divide\'\' / \'\'Automatic\'\' (2010\xe2\x80\x932011)===
A new remix album called \'\'Crossing The Divide\'\' was to be released on 8 June 2010,<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8168530 VNV Nation Crossing The Divide]</ref> but was delayed until May 2012. The update on the official website cited unforeseen circumstances and "personal matters which weren\'t appropriate for public discussion"<ref>[https://www.myspace.com/vnvnation/blog]</ref> for the delay, but have promised that additional tracks will be added.<ref>http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/future.htm</ref>

There were plans for a number of extended and enhanced re-releases of previous albums in 2010 "with lots of extras" as well. However, these also appear to have been caught up in the \'\'Crossing The Divide\'\' delays.<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=6066468&blogId=523298262 VNV Nation MySpace post regarding albums in 2010]</ref>

On 16 September 2011, VNV Nation\'s eighth studio album \'\'[[Automatic (VNV Nation Album)|Automatic]]\'\', was released for most of Europe, with a physical CD released on 25 October 2011 in the United States. It has been announced that the \'\'Crossing the Divide\'\' EP will be made available for free due to the delays.<ref>http://www.vnvnation.com/Webfiles/future.htm</ref>

On 14 May 2012, the EP was announced on the band\'s Facebook page and released the same day as a free download from Soundcloud.<ref>https://soundcloud.com/vnvnation/sets/crossing-the-divide</ref> It contains six tracks. No announcement was made on the band\'s own website.

===\'\'Gothic meets Klassik, Transnational & Resonance\'\' (2012\xe2\x80\x9315)===
In November 2012, VNV Nation, [[Blutengel]] and [[Staubkind]] performed for two days at [[Gothic meets Klassik]] in Leipzig. On the 10th, they played a regular set as usual, and on the 11th, they played an exclusive set accompanied by a full [[symphony orchestra]]. It marked the first time VNV Nation had done a set like this. The show was recorded for release, but the recorded audio was unusable. As a result, Ronan began work with the arranger on plans for an album, later titled \'\'Resonance\'\', of VNV Nation songs, scored for Orchestra, which will include the tracks performed at 2012\'s Gothic Meets Klassik festival, as well as additional songs. Ronan also performed a selection of VNV Nation songs with a classical pianist on the 2013 Gothic Cruise.

The new album [[Transnational (VNV Nation album)|Transnational]] was pushed back due to technical issues and was released on 11 October (EU),<ref>https://www.facebook.com/VNVNation/posts/10152233838391258</ref> 15 October (NA),<ref>https://www.facebook.com/VNVNation/posts/10152258840391258</ref> and elsewhere on 19 November, preceded by a promotional tour on 2 October 2013.
<ref>gothic-meets-klassik.de</ref>

The orchestral album \'Resonance\' will be released on 15 May 2015. It will comprise of tracks selected from their back catalogue reimagined for orchestra. It was recorded in the [[Babelsberg Studios]] outside Berlin at the end of February 2015, the same studios where scores for films such as [[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \xe2\x80\x93 Part 1]] & [[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2|Part 2]]. Confirmed titles so far include; Sentinel, Nova, Solitary and Standing. The album was too long for a single vinyl, and will be released as a double vinyl as part of the Resonance box set. A special track recorded with a piano and string trio, which has yet to be named, will feature alongside the orchestral tracks.

\'\'\'X Marks the Pedwalk\'\'\' (sometimes written as X-Marks the Pedwalk<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de X-MARKS THE PEDWALK | BASE >>> the official website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Band (music)|band]] whose [[Music genre|styles]] range from [[post-industrial (music)|post-industrial]] dance to electronic body music. X Marks the Pedwalk\xe2\x80\x99s influence in the industrial and electronic music [[Subculture|scenes]] was considerable during the 1990s, as they were one of the first and most popular acts from the now defunct [[record label]], [[Zoth Ommog]].

==History==
X Marks the Pedwalk was founded by Sevren Ni-Arb (born Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta, May 13, 1969) in 1987.  Schmechta - himself a classically trained musician - became interested in [[synthesizers]] at an early age, and found himself part of several bands after he was able to buy his first keyboard at the age of 16.  At that time, with influences such as [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Kraftwerk]], and [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|DAF]],  Schmechta started a band called Scarecrow with his school-mate Regan Eracs (born J\xc3\xb6rg B\xc3\xb6hme).

Shortly after releasing their first [[single (music)|single]], 1988\'s "Black Door", the members of Scarecrow were offered to sign to German [[DJ]] [[Talla 2XLC]]\'s new record label, [[Zoth Ommog]].  Thereafter, the project name was changed to X Marks the Pedwalk, and both members adopted [[pseudonyms]] for themselves.

Schmechta, who did the [[Songwriter|writing]], [[Record producer|production]], and engineering of all X Marks the Pedwalk tracks, was the only consistent member throughout X Marks the Pedwalk\xe2\x80\x99s history.  After the release of the first [[album]], \'\'[[Freaks (X Marks the Pedwalk album)|Freaks]]\'\', and then the "[[Cenotaph (Single)|Cenotaph]]" single, B\xc3\xb6hme left the band in 1992 to pursue other interests, and Schmechta enlisted the help of his brother Raive Yarx (born Thorsten Schmechta, June 14, 1971).

At this time, Schmechta decided to focus on music as a career, and built T.G.I.F. Studios (an [[acronym]] for "Thank God It\'s Friday!").  Although a new member had arrived, X Marks the Pedwalk\'s musical style did not change drastically until after the Schmechta brothers\' first two efforts together: \'\'[[Human Desolation]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Killing Had Begun]]\'\'.  1995\'s single "Facer", however, saw the combination of "Techno-Dance and Crossover-Industrial with [[electronic body music|EBM]]-elements".<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/band_story.html X-MARKS THE PEDWALK | BASE >>> the official website<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The final two X Marks the Pedwalk albums, \'\'[[Meshwork]]\'\' and \'\'[[Drawback (album)|Drawback]]\'\', received favorable reactions by many [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] within Europe, and thanks to the latter\'s release by [[Metropolis Records]], helped build an extended fanbase in [[North America]].  Some listeners, however, rejected the new sound of X Marks the Pedwalk (see \'\'[[Meshwork]]\'\').

Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta put aside his work on X Marks the Pedwalk in the late 90\'s (along with his multitude of side-projects) to concentrate on his family and career.<ref name="Zeit">[http://www.zeitspringer.de/ Zeitspringer.de]</ref>  He is married to Stefanie Eckmann (born March 21, 1969) who has contributed vocals to X Marks the Pedwalk under the name Estefania, and has two children: Lennard Christian and Luis Maximilian.  

X Marks the Pedwalk returned in late 2009/early 2010 with a new album and single, with live shows in 2010.

===Live===
The first X Marks the Pedwalk concert was performed in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany on December 16, 1989, where they opened for industrial music artists [[Vomito Negro (band)|Vomito Negro]].  Most live material at that time came from their then just-released single "[[Arbitrary Execution]]", and the previously released Scarecrow single "[[Black Door]]".

Their first tour throughout Germany began after the release of \'\'[[Freaks (X Marks the Pedwalk album)|Freaks]]\'\', with an additional concert being played in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]].  Three subsequent concert tours throughout Germany occurred again after the release of "[[Cenotaph (single)|Cenotaph]]", \'\'[[Human Desolation]]\'\', and \'\'[[The Killing Had Begun]]\'\'.  With few exceptions, these live shows took place in Germany.

X Marks the Pedwalk was a band that consisted of two members at a time (secondary members B\xc3\xb6hme and Thorsten Schmechta never appeared together on an album with Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta), therefore, they never performed completely live, but rather relied heavily on the incorporation of [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] playback.  This was complemented with "live overdubs, drum-effects, lead-melodies, [and] atmospheres...",<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/output_ontour.html Xmtp.de ontour]</ref> and Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta on lead vocals.  Estefania did not appear on an X Marks the Pedwalk release until \'\'[[The Killing Had Begun]]\'\', and never toured live with them.

As of 2004, X Marks the Pedwalk still receives requests to play live, although Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta has said that "at the moment it\'s impossible to plan a tour or concerts".<ref name="Xmtp.de news">[http://www.xmtp.de/update_news.html Xmtp.de news]</ref>

===Side projects===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pax]] -->
Throughout the course of X Marks the Pedwalk\'s history, Andr\xc3\xa9 Schemchta especially formed or joined several side projects as a creative outlet for music that had a different sound than X Marks the Pedwalk.  This is a list and short description of some of the other ventures taken upon by members of X Marks the Pedwalk.

\'\'\'PAX\'\'\' was a project that was created as the result of a working relationship between Andr\xc3\xa9 Schemchta and Heiko Daniel.  Schmechta, who was producing an album for Daniel, felt that they had "something fascinating, easy, emotional and outstanding."<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/output_projects.html Xmtp.de projects]</ref> From this, two albums and an EP were born.

\'\'\'Ringtailed Snorter\'\'\' was a solo-project by Andr\xc3\xa9 Schemchta, the first song of which was written as a tribute to a friend who had died.  Ringtailed Snorter differs from X Marks the Pedwalk in its use of "clean structures" and "minimal soundscapes to leave more [space in] the minds of the audience."<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/output_projects1.html Xmtp.de preojects]</ref>

\'\'\'Hyperdex-1-Sect\'\'\' was a one-time collaboration between Andr\xc3\xa9 and Stefanie Schemchta and Jonathan Sharp of the project New Mind.  Their release features remixes by the artists\' main projects (X Marks the Pedwalk and New Mind, respectively), as well as a remix by [[cEvin Key]]\'s project, [[Download (band)|Download]].

\'\'\'U-Tek\'\'\' saw the coming together of Alexis Schaar (also known as AL/X/S, former producer for X Marks the Pedwalk) and Andr\xc3\xa9 Schemchta to form a project that combined Alexis\'s dance and club music background with Schmechta\'s EBM background.  The duo\'s second project, \'\'\'A-Head\'\'\' focused less on this interaction and more on creating alternative electro music.

\'\'\'Deluga\'\'\' was a [[darkwave]] project by Thorsten Schmechta, Stefanie Schmechta, and Falk Aupers.  The project never got past the first demo stage.

Some other projects by Andr\xc3\xa9 Schemchta included two with wife Stefanie, \'\'\'Viviane\'\'\' and \'\'\'Polyxena\'\'\', the latter also featuring Heiko Daniel, and \'\'\'Lighthouse\'\'\' with friend Bernd Sch\xc3\xb6ler.

==Philosophy and style==
X Marks the Pedwalk was inspired by the late 1980s [[Europe]]an and [[Canadian]] [[Electronic body music]] scenes, yet its members were looking to create a sound that was unique to themselves. Early X Marks the Pedwalk was often compared to fellow industrial musicians [[Skinny Puppy]]; \'\'Front Page\'\' magazine titled an article about X Marks the Pedwalk, "Die deutschen Skinny Puppy?!" (The German Skinny Puppy?!).<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/data/frontpage91.pdf]</ref> Later, however, as their style progressed, X Marks the Pedwalk would begin to find other bands compared to them. According to Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta, "The concept and themes for the lyrics around [X Marks the Pedwalk] were influenced by the idea to lighten up the dark side of [the] human psyche\xe2\x80\xa6"<ref name="Band Philosophy on xmtp.de">[http://www.xmtp.de/band_philosophy.html \'\'Band Philosophy\'\' on xmtp.de]</ref> Although the latter may be true, in as much as it was an objective strived for by the band, X Marks the Pedwalk found most of its audience in fans of [[Goth music|gothic]] and [[industrial music]] - scenes typically associated with dark culture. What Schmechta describes as X Marks the Pedwalk\'s "aggressive percussion and synthesizer sequences"<ref name="Band Philosophy on xmtp.de" /> may have contributed to its place within the harder dance music scenes.

In addition to Skinny Puppy, comparable bands include many of the [[Zoth Ommog]] label-mates of X Marks the Pedwalk. Some of the more prominent similar acts include [[Le\xc3\xa6ther Strip]], [[Evil\'s Toy]], [[Armageddon Dildos]], [[Spahn Ranch (band)|Spahn Ranch]], [[Mentallo and the Fixer|Mentallo & The Fixer]], [[Birmingham 6 (band)|Birmingham 6]], and [[Funker Vogt]].

==Members==
*Sevren Ni-arb (born Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta, 13 May 1969): Founder, songwriter, vocalist, producer, and engineer.

*Estefania (Stefanie Schmechta n\xc3\xa9e Eckmann, born 21 March 1969): Secondary vocalist, debuted on the album, \'\'The Killing Had Begun\'\'.

==Equipment==
In 1992, Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta created T.G.I.F. studios, recording not only all of X Marks the Pedwalk\'s subsequent material, but also albums by fellow electronic music artists Armageddon Dildos (who were also on [[Zoth Ommog]]) and Evil\'s Toy, among others.  T.G.I.F. was built and designed specifically for the creation of electronic and industrial music, what follows is a list of some of the equipment utilized by Schmechta not only as both a writer and performer, but also as a producer:<ref>[http://www.xmtp.de/band_tgif.html Xmtp.de]</ref>

==Naming==
The name X Marks the Pedwalk comes from a satirical story by [[science fiction]] author [[Fritz Leiber]] that describes the beginnings of a war between pedestrians and motorists. The story is glancingly referenced in [[Stephen King]]\'s book \'\'[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]\'\'.

Since the earliest days of X Marks the Pedwalk, members have assumed [[pseudonym]]s for themselves.  Andr\xc3\xa9 Schmechta was known as Sevren Ni-arb ("Brain Nerves" spelled backwards), his brother Thorsten was Raive Yarx (Yarx is "X-Ray" spelled backwards).  Early member J\xc3\xb6rg B\xc3\xb6hme was called Regan Eracs (Regan is the name of the possessed child in \'\'[[The Exorcist]]\'\', and Eracs is "scare" backwards).  Stefanie Eckmann Schmechta, because she was a student of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], listed her name as Estefania.

b'{{lowercase|yelworC}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2007}}
\'\'\'yelworC\'\'\' is an [[Electro-industrial|electro]] band from [[Germany]].

The group was formed in [[1987 in music|1987]] by Peter Devin and Oliver B\xc3\xbcttner (a.k.a. Dominik van Reich). Their name is derived from the name of [[Aleister Crowley]], and their music reflects themes of dark magic, religious rituals, death, and violence.

==History==
The duo put out a number of demo tapes between [[1988 in music|1988]] - [[1990 in music|1990]] until they were finally signed to the now defunct Celtic Circle Productions (C.C.P.) [[recording label]] and released their first full-length CD album \'\'Brainstorming\'\' in [[1993 in music|1993]].

Their music consists of gloomy synthesizers mixed with abrasive dance-beats, overlaid with distorted vocals and the occasional audio sample taken from various horror films. The musical result is a style akin to [[Skinny Puppy]], that has inspired many other groups in the electro-industrial and [[goth music|gothic]] genres.

In [[1994 in music|1994]], after what looked like a promising career, yelworC unexpectedly split up, with van Reich heading off to form the more experimental sounding \'\'\'amGod\'\'\' ("dogma" backwards) and cutting one album \'\'Half Rotten and Decayed\'\' under the C.C.P. label. Devin fought and successfully kept the rights to use the name \'\'yelworC\'\'.

For the past few years, yelworC\'s material could only be found through [[peer-to-peer]] internet sharing. However, in [[2004 in music|2004]], Devin released a new studio album entitled \'\'Trinity\'\'; the first release from yelworC in over ten years (although one or two of the songs appeared on compilations).  The album, containing some material composed during the late 1990s, is based on [[Dante]]\'s journey through [[Hell]] as told in \'\'[[The Divine Comedy]]\'\'.  It also features a guest appearance by Dennis Ostermann of [[In Strict Confidence]] on the song \'\'Vexilla Regis Inferni\'\'.

Out via Minuswelt on October 19 is yelworC\'s "Icolation". The 17-track release comes after the July 2007 release of the "Eclosion" EP.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25830_0_2_0_C yelworC launches \'Icolation\' album]</ref>

\'\'\'Boyd Blake Rice\'\'\' (born December 16, 1956) is an American experimental sound/noise musician using the name of \'\'\'NON\'\'\' since the mid-1970s, [[archivist]], actor, photographer, author, member of the \'\'Partridge Family Temple\'\' religious group, co-founder of the [http://www.unpopart.org/about.html UNPOP art movement] and current staff writer for \'\'[[Modern Drunkard Magazine|Modern Drunkard]]\'\' magazine.<ref name=MDM>[http://www.drunkard.com/md_staff.html Modern Drunkard Magazine Online staff writer list]</ref>

==Biography==
Rice became widely known through his involvement in [[V. Vale]]\'s [[RE/Search]] books. He is profiled in RE/Search #6/7: [[Industrial Culture Handbook]]<ref name=REINDUSHAND /> and \'\'[[Pranks!]]\'\'.<ref name=REPRANKS>Juno, Andrea (Editor), Ballard, J. G. (Editor), \'\'Re/Search #11: Pranks\'\' (1987) ISBN 0-940642-10-7</ref> In \'\'Pranks\'\', Rice described his experience in 1976 when he tried to give [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]\'s wife, [[Betty Ford]], a skinned [[Domestic sheep|sheep]]\'s head on a silver platter. In this interview, he emphasized the consensus nature of reality and the havoc that can be wreaked by refusing to play by the collective rules that dictate most people\'s perception of the external world.

In the mid-1980s Rice became close friends with [[Anton LaVey]], founder and [[wiktionary:High Priest|High Priest]] of the [[Church of Satan]], and was made a Priest, then later a [[Magister (Church of Satan)|Magister]] in the [[Council of Nine]] of the Church. The two admired much of the same music and shared a similar [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] outlook. Each had been inspired by \'\'[[Might is Right]]\'\' in fashioning various works: LaVey in his seminal \'\'[[The Satanic Bible|Satanic Bible]]\'\' and Rice in several recordings.

Rice\'s [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] outlook eventually led to him founding the Social Darwinist [[think tank]] called The Abraxas Foundation, along with co-founder [[Nikolas Schreck]], named after the ancient [[Gnostic]] god [[Abraxas]]. The organization promotes [[authoritarianism]], [[totalitarianism]], [[misanthropism]], and [[elitism]], is antidemocratic, and has some philosophical overlap with the [[Church of Satan]]. During an interview with Christian talk show host [[Bob Larson]], Rice described the basic philosophy of the foundation as being "The strong rule the weak, and the clever rule the strong".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzsiyFmMTmI |title=Boyd Rice debates with Bob Larson 3/5 |publisher=YouTube |date=June 21, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

Rice has documented the writings of [[Charles Manson]] in his role as contributing editor of \'\'[[The Manson File]]\'\'. Rice was a featured guest on \'\'[[Talk Back]]\'\', a radio program hosted by the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian [[Bob Larson]].<ref>name=SNAKEOIL>[http://www.devilsweb.com/snakeoil/boyd.html "My Dinner with Bob Larson"], \'\'Snake Oil\'\' magazine (1994)</ref> In total, Rice made five appearances on Larson\'s program.

Although Rice was sometimes reported to possess the world\'s largest [[Barbie]] collection, he confessed in a 2003 interview with [[Brian M. Clark]] to owning only a few.<ref name=BLACKPIMP>From \'\'The Black Pimp Speaks\'\', 2003 interview with Boyd Rice appearing in \'\'Rated Rookie\'\' magazine No. 6, 2004. Viewable online: [http://www.boydrice.com/interviews/blackpimp.html]</ref>

In 2000, along with Tracy Twyman, editor of \'\'Dagobert\'s Revenge\'\', Rice filmed a special on the [[Rennes-le-Chateau]] for the program \'\'In Search of...\'\' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television. (The segment was later included in the 2002 version of \'\'[[In Search of... (TV series)#Mitch Pileggi revival|In Search of...]]\'\' on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]].)<!--I\'m not sure if Fox ever aired this, but the segment was included in the 2002 program, which I\'ve linked to here. I hope someone else can provide further details or references. --> Rice has done extensive research into [[Gnosticism]] as well as [[Holy Grail|Grail]] legends and [[Merovingian]] lore, sharing this research in \'\'Dagobert\'s Revenge\'\' and \'\'The Vessel of God\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Introduction to the Grail Research & Esoteric Writings of Boyd Rice|url=http://www.thevesselofgod.com/|work=The Vessel of God|publisher=Boyd Rice|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref>

Rice was involved in creating a [[Tiki bar]] called [[Tiki Boyd\'s]] at the [[East Coast Bar]] in [[Denver]], Colorado. Rice decorated the entire establishment out of his own pocket due to his fondness of [[Tiki culture]], asking an open tab at the bar in return. Boyd has long expressed a love of Tiki culture, in contrast to the other elements of his public persona.<ref name="boydrice.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.boydrice.com/tikiboyds/about.html |title=Tiki Boyd\'s \xe2\x80\x93 Denver\'s Newest & Only Tiki Bar |publisher=Boydrice.com |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref>

Tiki Boyd\'s was given its name in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiki Boyd\'s|url=http://www.boydrice.com/tikiboyds/|work=Tiki Boyd\'s|publisher=DISCRIMINATE MEDIA|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> Due to disagreements between Rice and the owners, Rice pulled out of the deal and reclaimed all of his Tiki decorations. The future of the bar as it remains now is uncertain. Rice plans to re-establish another Tiki Bar elsewhere in Denver.<ref name="boydrice.com"/>

==Music==
Rice creates music under his own name, as well as under the moniker of NON and with contributors under various other project names.

===Early sound experiments===
Rice started creating experimental noise recordings in 1975, drawing on his interest in [[Tape loop|tape machines]] and [[bubblegum pop]] sung by female vocalists such as [[Little Peggy March]] and [[Ginny Arnell]]. One of his earliest efforts consisted entirely of a loop of every time [[Lesley Gore]] sang the word "cry". After initially creating recordings simply for his own listening, he later started to give performances, and eventually make records. His musical project NON grew out of these early experiments; he reportedly selected the name because "it implies everything and nothing".

===Techniques and implementations===
From his earliest recordings, Rice has experimented with both sound and the medium through which that sound is conveyed. His methods of expanding upon the listening possibilities for recorded music were simple. On his second seven-inch, he had 2\xe2\x80\x934 extra holes punched into the record for "multi axial rotation".<ref name=\'wire256\'>{{cite journal|title=Laugh til it hurts|journal=The Wire magazine|issue=256|id= |url=|accessdate=July 5, 2007}}</ref> Another early LP was titled \'\'[[Play at Any Speed]]\'\'. While working exclusively with vinyl, he employed locked grooves that allowed listeners to create their own music. He was one of the first artists, after [[John Cage]], to treat [[phonograph|turntables]] as instruments{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} and developed various techniques for [[scratching]]. Rice has been treating sounds from vinyl recordings as early as 1975.<ref>Blood Book "Boyd Rice Interview" 2010</ref>

===NON===
Under the name NON, originally with second member [[Robert Turman]], Rice has recorded several seminal [[noise music]] albums, and collaborated with [[experimental music]]/[[dark folk]] artists like [[Current 93]], [[Death in June]] and [[Rose McDowall]]. Most of his music has been released on the [[Mute Records]] label. Rice has also collaborated with Frank Tovey of [[Fad Gadget]], [[Tony Wakeford]] of [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]] and [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] of [[Blood Axis]]. His later albums have often been explicitly [[concept album|conceptual]].

On \'\'[[Might!]]\'\' (1995), Rice layers portions of "[[Ragnar Redbeard]]"\'s [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] harangue, \'\'[[Might is Right]]\'\' over sound beds of looped noise and manipulated frequencies. 1997\'s \'\'[[God and Beast]]\'\' explores the intersection in the soul of man\'s physical and spiritual natures over the course of an album that alternates abrasive [[soundscape]]s with passages of tranquility.

In 2006, Rice returned to the studio to record raw vocal sound sources for a collaboration with Industrial, modern primitive percussionist/[[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] [[Z\'EV]]. In addition, he and long-time friend of twenty years Giddle Partridge planned an album titled \'\'LOVE/LOVE-BANG/BANG!\'\', under the band name of Giddle & Boyd. After the limited edition release of a bubblegum pink, heart-shaped vinyl E.P. titled, \'\'Going Steady With Peggy Moffitt\'\'. In early 2010, Rice announced that he and Giddle Partridge would focus on solo projects/albums for the time being.

===Crowd control===
Early NON performances were designed to offer choice to audience members who might otherwise expect only a prefabricated and totally passive entertainment experience. Rice has stated that he considers his performances to be "de-[[indoctrination]] rites". Rice has performed using a shoe polisher, the "rotoguitar" (an electric guitar with an [[electric fan]] on it), and other [[custom-made instruments|homemade instruments]]. He has also used [[found sound]]s, played at a volume just below the threshold of pain, to entice his audiences to endure his high decibel sound experiments.

Rice coupled his aural assaults with [[psychology|psychological]] [[torture]] on audiences in [[Den Haag]], the [[Netherlands]], by shining in their faces exceedingly bright lights that were deliberately placed just out of reach. As their frustration mounted, Rice states that he:
<blockquote>..continued to be friendly to the audience, which made them even madder, because they were so mad and I didn\'t care! They were shaking their fists at me, and I thought that at any minute there\'d be a riot. So I took it as far as I thought I could, and then thanked them and left.<ref name=REINDUSHAND>Vale, V. Juno, Andrea. \'\'Re/Search #6/7: Industrial Culture Handbook\'\' (1983) ISBN 0-940642-07-7</ref></blockquote>

==Art==
After dropping out of high school at the age of 17, Rice began an in-depth study of [[Modern art#Early 20th century|early 20th-century art movements]], producing his own [[Abstract art|abstract]] black and white paintings and experimental photographs. Early on, he met European [[Art history|art historian]] and gallery owner, [[Arturo Schwarz]], with whom he began a long correspondence. Schwarz, a biographer of [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] and [[Man Ray]], encouraged Rice to pursue his art, no matter what. And he did. Though he would later shift his focus to sound, he has never stopped creating visual art and has given a number of [[One-person show|one man shows]] over the years.<ref>Press release from Mitchell Algus Gallery (NYC) for Rice\'s one man show of paintings.</ref>

==Photography==
In the mid-1970s Rice devoted a great deal of time to experimental photography, developing a process by which he could produce "photographs of things which don\'t exist".<ref>Standing in Two Circles</ref> He had a one man show of the photos in the early 1980s at Richard Peterson\'s Pink & Pearl Gallery in San Diego, which was documented in the local press, the \'\'San Diego Union\'\' and \'\'Evening Tribune\'\'. He has never revealed the means by which he made these photos, and has stated publicly that the secret will go to the grave with him. Some of these photos can be seen in his book \'\'Standing in Two Circles\'\' (Creation Press, 2008).

==Writings==
Over the years, Boyd Rice\'s writings have been [[Translation|translated]] into at least six languages.<ref>Biography of "No", Heartworm Press</ref> His collected writings were published in 2008 by Creation Press. A French language edition followed on Camion Noir.

In 2009, his book \'\'NO\'\' was published. This was widely regarded{{by whom|date=January 2013}} as a book defining Rice\'s [[Philosophy|personal philosophy]]. Rice defined the book as merely a "laundry list" of things he didn\'t believe in.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} He later stated in an interview with [[WFMU]]\'s \'\'Beware of the Blog\'\', "sometimes the things you don\'t believe are more important than what you do believe".

In October 2011, [[Heartworm Press]] published Rice\'s \'\'Twilight Man\'\', a noir memoir about his life in 1980\'s San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Controversy==
In 1989, Rice and [[Bob Heick]] of the [[American Front]] were photographed for \'\'[[Sassy Magazine]]\'\' wearing uniforms and brandishing knives. While Rice would later recall it as a prank, the photo has caused boycotts and protests at many of Rice\'s appearances. When asked if he regrets the photo, Rice stated, "I don\'t care. I don\'t think I ever made a wrong move. The bad stuff is just good. America loves its villains".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.boydrice.com/interviews/tangents.html | title = With Pity Towards None (interview) | work=Tangents | year = 1997}}</ref>

This photograph was additionally published in the book \'\'Blood in the Face: The Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, Nazi Skinheads, and the Rise of a New White Culture\'\' by [[James Ridgeway]].<ref name=ridgeway>[[James Ridgeway|Ridgeway, James]]. \'\'Blood in the Face: The Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, Nazi Skinheads, and the Rise of a New White Culture\'\'. New York: Thunder\'s Mouth Press, 1990.  ISBN 978-1-56025-003-6</ref>

More controversy has resulted because of Rice\'s appearance on \'\'Race and Reason\'\',<ref>"Boyd Rice\'s Race and Reason interview causes controversy" http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=33873_0_2_0_C</ref> a [[public-access television]] cable TV show hosted by [[White Nationalism|white nationalist]] [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]]. Rice has claimed not to be a Nazi in numerous interviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boydrice.com/interviews/misanthrope.html |title=Boyd Rice |publisher=Boyd Rice |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> whilst his friend [[Rose McDowall]] has claimed he has never said anything [[Racism|racist]] nor endorsed Nazism to her.<ref>"He\'s never said anything racist to me. I\'ve talked to him about it and he\'s said he now has to be careful about things he says because people will misconstrue things. I\'m sure he did wear swastikas when he was a punk, a lot of punks did" \xe2\x80\x93 Rose McDowall, more quotes like this in the interview also. http://www.strawberryswitchblade.net/print.php?section=interviews&item=rose</ref> However [[Stewart Home]] has claimed that Rice is a supporter of Nazism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/wakeford2.htm |title=Tony Wakeford, Sol Invictus, Above The Ruins, fascism, Boyd Rice |publisher=Stewarthomesociety.org |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Boyd Rice is associated with [[Church of Satan]] founder [[Anton LaVey]] <ref>picture of Boyd and LaVey: http://www.boydrice.com/gallery/friends_gallery/1980-02.html</ref> and has collaborated with [[Adam Parfrey]]<ref>[http://www.boydrice.com/discography/friendsdiscography.html \'\'Hatesville\'\' at Boyd Rice and Friends\'s discography]</ref> who is Jewish.<ref>{{Cite episode

On August 8, 1988, Boyd Rice was among the organizers and performers at 8/8/88, a Satanic Nazi rally organized at the Strand Theater in San Francisco, which was locally heavily advertised and sold out, billed as the largest gathering of Satanists ever recorded. Rice appeared with the band [[Radio Werewolf]] as well as Zeena Lavey of the Church of Satan, and with the Secret Chiefs and Kris Force.<ref>{{Cite episode

\'\'\'Throbbing Gristle\'\'\' were an English music and [[visual arts]] group that evolved from the [[performance art]] group [[COUM Transmissions]]. Established in 1975, the band is widely viewed, along with contemporaries [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], as having created the [[industrial music|industrial]] music genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Savage |first=Jon |authorlink=Jon Savage |year=2011 |title=England\'s Dreaming |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=0571261191}}</ref> The band consisted of [[Genesis P-Orridge]] (born Neil Megson; bass guitar, violin, vocals, vibraphone), [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]] (born Christine Newby; guitars, cornet, vocals), [[Peter Christopherson|Peter "Sleazy" Christopherson]] (tapes, found sounds, horns, piano, vibraphone, synthesizer) and [[Chris Carter (musician)|Chris Carter]] (synthesizers, tapes, electronics).

The group disbanded in 1981, but the individual members went on to participate in other projects, and reformed in 2004 for a second stint before disbanding again in 2010 after the death of Peter Christopherson.

== History ==

=== First era: 1976\xe2\x80\x931981 ===

Throbbing Gristle evolved from the performance art group [[COUM Transmissions]], which was formed in [[Kingston upon Hull]] by a group of performers centered on [[Genesis P-Orridge]] and [[Cosey Fanni Tutti]]. The final performance of COUM Transmissions in 1976 was also the debut of Throbbing Gristle.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Throbbing Gristle\'s confrontational live performances and use of often disturbing imagery, including pornography and photographs of Nazi [[concentration camp]]s, gave the group a notorious reputation. However, the group always maintained that their mission was to challenge and explore the darker and obsessive sides of the human condition rather than to make attractive music.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Throbbing Gristle made extensive use of pre-recorded tape-based [[sampling (music)|samples]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/thresholdhouse/blog/186224635 |title=Equipment, And My Little Part of History by Sleazy on MySpace |last=Christopherson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Christopherson |date=29 October 2006 |website=[[MySpace]] |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and special effects to produce a distinctive, highly distorted background, usually accompanied by lyrics or spoken-word performances by Cosey Fanni Tutti or Genesis P-Orridge. Though they asserted they wanted to provoke their audience into thinking for themselves rather than pushing any specific agenda (as evidenced by the song "Don\'t Do As You\'re Told, Do As You Think" on \'\'[[Heathen Earth]]\'\'), Throbbing Gristle also frequently associated with the [[anarchopunk|anarchist punk]] scene. They appeared in the [[fanzine]] \'\'Toxic Grafity\'\', with a condensation of their own propaganda parody series, Industrial News.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09407F.html |title=Crass Discography (\'\'Toxic Graffiti\'\') |website=Transmissions from Southern |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19970506142103/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09407F.html |archivedate=6 May 1997 |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

In 1977, they released their debut single, "[[United/Zyklon B Zombie|United]]"/"[[United/Zyklon B Zombie|Zyklon B Zombie]]", followed by an album, \'\'[[The Second Annual Report]]\'\'. Although pressed in a limited initial run of 786 copies on the band\'s own [[Industrial Records]] label, it was later re-released on [[Mute Records]] due to high demand; however, this later release was reversed with all tracks playing backwards and in reverse order. This was followed by a series of albums, singles and live performances over a four-year period.

On 29 May 1981, Throbbing Gristle performed at the [[Kezar Pavilion]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States. This concert marked the end of the group and its mission. As Cosey succinctly put it, "TG broke up because me and Gen broke up".{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Genesis P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form [[Psychic TV]], while Cosey Fanni Tutti and Carter continued to record together under the names of [[Chris and Cosey]], [[Carter Tutti]] and Creative Technology Institute. Christopherson later went on to become half of the band [[Coil (band)|Coil]] with his partner and fellow [[Psychic TV]] member, the late [[John Balance]]. Meanwhile, Gen (now known as Genesis Breyer P-Orridge) subsequently formed [[Thee Majesty]] and [[Psychic TV|PTV3]] with the help of his wife, the late [[Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge|Jacqueline "Jaye" Breyer]].

=== Second era: 2004\xe2\x80\x932010 ===

In 2004, Throbbing Gristle briefly reunited to record and release the limited album \'\'[[TG Now]]\'\'. On 2 April 2007, TG released the album \'\'[[Part Two (Throbbing Gristle album)|Part Two]]\'\', which the group had finished recording in Berlin. With the exception of \'\'TG Now\'\', it was their first studio album in twenty five years. It was originally set to be released by Mute Records in September 2006 but was delayed for unknown reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In March 2007, [[Side-Line]] announced \'\'Part Two\'\'<nowiki>\'</nowiki>s final release date, adding that a string of special live events would take place in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=21321_0_2_0_C |title=Throbbing Gristle Announce Special Live Events to Celebrate First New Album in Over 25 Years \xe2\x80\x93 Throbbing Gristle News at side-line.com |date=14 March 2007 |website=[[Side-Line]] |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

The group performed a re-interpretation of their debut album \'\'[[The Second Annual Report]]\'\' twice in 2008 to mark thirty years since its original release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com.au/2008/12/thirty-second-annual-report-limited.html |title=Throbbing Gristle: \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\'Thirty-Second Annual Report\'\' \xe2\x80\xa2 |date=12 January 2008 |website=Throbbing Gristle |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> The performance in Paris on 6 June was issued as a limited edition framed vinyl set entitled \'\'The Thirty-Second Annual Report\'\', which was limited to 777 copies (as the group claim the original was, although other sources claim that there were 785).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brainwashed.com/common/htdocs/discog/ir0002.php?site=tg08 |title=Throbbing Gristle, "\'\'The Second Annual Report\'\' Of" |website=Brainwashed |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

Throbbing Gristle worked to record an album based on their interpretation of [[Nico]]\'s album \'\'[[Desertshore]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/news/ |title=News :: Throbbing Gristle Store Shop |website=Greedbag |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070618094526/http://tg.greedbag.com/news/ |archivedate=18 June 2007 |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> The group issued the entirety of the recording sessions for this album as a limited edition twelve-CD set packaged in a custom CD wallet, \'\'[[The Desertshore Installation]]\'\', which sold out via mail order from the group\'s website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/the-desertshore-installation/ |title=Throbbing Gristle \xe2\x80\x93 \'\'The Desertshore Installation\'\' 12 CD Wallet :: Industrial Records Store |website=Greedbag |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

In April 2009, Throbbing Gristle toured the United States, appearing at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago. A new release was made available at these shows, \'\'[[The Third Mind Movements]]\'\', which was edited from jams recorded during the \'\'Desertshore\'\' recording sessions.

A collaboration with [[Cerith Wyn Evans]] titled \'\'A=P=P=A=R=I=T=I=O=N\'\' was displayed at Tramway, Glasgow from the 7 August to 27 September 2009. Throbbing Gristle contributed a multi-channel soundtrack that was played through sixteen hanging Audio Spotlight sound panels that Evans had incorporated into his sculpture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com.au/2009/10/tg-collaborationwith-cerith-wyn-evans.html |title=Throbbing Gristle \xe2\x80\xa2 TG Collaboration with Cerith Wyn Evans \xe2\x80\xa2 |date=10 January 2009 |website=Throbbing Gristle |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

In November 2009, Throbbing Gristle and [[Industrial Records]] released their version of the [[FM3#Buddha Machine|Buddha Machine]] called Gristleism. It was designed by Throbbing Gristle and Christiaan Virant based on [[FM3]]\'s design. Gristleism offers more loops and almost twice the frequency range of the Buddha Machine. The player comes in three colors: black, chrome and red.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tg.greedbag.com/buy/gristleism-the-badged-limited-ed/ |title=Throbbing Gristle \xe2\x80\x93 Gristleism \xe2\x80\x93 The Badged Limited-Edition :: Industrial Records Store |website=Greedbag |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

On 29 October 2010, Throbbing Gristle announced on their website that Genesis P-Orridge had informed them that he was no longer willing to perform with Throbbing Gristle and would be returning to his home in New York. Chris, Cosey and Christopherson would finish the tour under the name X-TG.

P-Orridge\'s website stated that he had not quit Throbbing Gristle and had just stopped participating on the current tour; it also said that an explanation would be released when all things were cleared up. However, on 24 November 2010, Christopherson died in his sleep at the age of 55, and the band subsequently dissolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://inlog.org/2010/11/25/r-i-p-peter-sleazy-christopherson-throbbing-gristle-x-tg-1955-2010/ |title=Incubate Blog \xc2\xbb Blog Archive \xc2\xbb R.I.P.

=== Third era: 2011\xe2\x80\x93current ===

In 2011, [[Industrial Records]] had an official "re-activation", as TG\'s contract with [[Mute Records]] had expired. Since TG has permanently disbanded following the death of Christopherson, the label\'s plan is to re-release the original TG albums (\'\'[[The Second Annual Report]]\'\', \'\'[[D.o.A: The Third and Final Report]]\'\', \'\'[[20 Jazz Funk Greats]]\'\', \'\'[[Heathen Earth]]\'\' and \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Throbbing Gristle album)|Greatest Hits]]\'\') on the label. Originally intended to be released en masse on 26 September 2011, they had to delay due to a Sony DADC warehouse fire in London. The plan changed to issue each album chronologically once per week starting on Halloween 2011 with \'\'The Second Annual Report\'\' and ending 28 November with \'\'Greatest Hits\'\'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/tg-files/index.html |title=throbbing-gristle.com |website=throbbing-gristle.com |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

Industrial Records announced that a double album, called \'\'Desertshore/The Final Report\'\', would be released on 26 November 2012. Chris and Cosey produced the album, with the participation of guest vocalists [[Antony Hegarty]] (from [[Antony and the Johnsons]]), [[Blixa Bargeld]] (from [[Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten]]), [[Marc Almond]] (from [[Soft Cell]]), film director [[Gaspar No\xc3\xa9]] and former pornstar [[Sasha Grey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.throbbing-gristle.com/INDUSTRIALRECORDS/desertshore/desertshore.html |title=Industrial Records \xe2\x80\x93 Releasing \'Industrial Music for Industrial People\' Since 1977 |website=throbbing-gristle.com |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

A group decision had been made prior to Christopherson\'s death that the album would be recorded afresh, as they were not satisfied with the ICA recordings. Christopherson had been the driving force behind the project and had been working on the record in [[Bangkok]] with [[Danny Hyde]], even getting custom instruments made to use for the album. "It was Sleazy\'s project, then Cosey and Sleazy\'s, then I came in on it", Carter explained in an interview with [[The Quietus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06114-chris-cosey-throbbing-gristle-desertshore |title=The Quietus <nowiki>| News |</nowiki> Chris & Cosey Talk Plans to Finish TG\'s \'\'Desertshore\'\' |last=Turner |first=Luke |date=19 April 2011 |website=[[The Quietus]] |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> After Christopherson died, the \'\'Desertshore\'\' instruments were given to Carter and Cosey and they have been combining the recordings he had been making with the work they had done themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/chris-cosey/ |title=Chris & Cosey \xe2\x80\xa2 Interview \xe2\x80\xa2 Music Can Be Regarded as Art. <nowiki>|</nowiki> Art Can Be Regarded as Music. \xe2\x80\xa2 Peek-a-Boo Music Magazine |last=Becu |first=Didier |date=18 June 2011 |website=Peek-a-Boo Music Magazine |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> They have announced plans to debut the album live at [[AV Festival]] on 17 March 2012 accompanied by a screening of [[Philippe Garrel]]\'s film \'\'The Inner Scar\'\' "for which \'\'Desertshore\'\' was soundtrack and inspiration".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avfestival.co.uk/programme/2012/events-and-exhibitions/wishful-thinking |title=Wishful Thinking: In Remembrance of Peter Christopherson \xe2\x80\xb9 Events & Exhibitions \xe2\x80\xb9 AV Festival: As Slow as Possible \xe2\x80\xb9 Programme \xe2\x80\xb9 AV Festival |website=AV Festival |accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>

 ****** Acumen Nation

b'{{Cleanup|date=December 2008}}
\'\'\'Acumen Nation\'\'\' is an [[industrial rock]] band based in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

==History==
Formed in the late 1980s as Acumen by [[Jason Novak]] and Ethan Novak, the band released several cassette demos before self-releasing the CD demo "[[Transmissions from Eville]]" in 1994. The two along with bassist Greg Lopez put the record out themselves under the Robot Records moniker. During shows for this period, the band added guitarist/engineer Jamie Duffy. Duffy greatly improved the band\'s sound onstage{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} and rounded the group into a tight fourpiece helping them to get noticed by upstart independent industrial label [[Fifth Colvmn Records]] who signed the band and reissued [[Transmissions from Eville]] worldwide.

==Hits==
{{peacock|section|date=May 2013}}
I am about to sound like a hipster.... With breakaway dancefloor hits like "Matador" and the irresistibly punchy "Gun Lover" Acumen was starting to get noticed amongst industrial/gothic music fans. National tours with [[The Clay People]] and [[16 Volt]] soon resulted and in an effort to capitalize on the buzz they had created, the band headed back to Chicago Trax Studios to record their follow-up entitled [[Territory=Universe]]. More mature, polished, harder and reflective of a specific moment in the band\'s career, Territory=Universe showed that Acumen had a dense multi-layered sound that could pulse on the dancefloor and was underscored with emotion. Standout tracks included "Mike", "Queener" and "You Deal With This". With heads now turning towards their latest, Acumen was invited to go out on a national tour with industrial rock pioneers [[Chemlab]] and enjoyed shorter stints supporting industrial rock legends [[KMFDM]] and Monster Voodooo Machine.

==Popularity==
Although the glory days of the Industrial rock scene in Chicago had faded by the time Acumen emerged as a national act, through constant touring and sheer hard work on a number of different projects the duo have since established themselves as somewhat relevant within a tiny niche of the US underground scene. \'\'\'The Iron Lung Corp.\'\'\' was a band composed of Acumen and [[The Clay People]] from Albany, NY. Their first record, \'96s "Big Shiny Spears" featured covers of Nitzer Ebb\'s seminal dance hits \'Join in the Chant\' and \'Murderous.\'

==Name dispute==
In 1997, the band were forced to change their name due to a legal dispute with a preexisting progressive rock band also called Acumen. The band split their project into two halves - the [[drum and bass]] influenced [[DJ? Acucrack]], and the more traditional rock format of Acumen Nation. Tours for both projects followed. In 1998, Greg Lopez left the band to pursue other interests. He was replaced by Eric Alvarez, also known as the bar. The four recorded 2000\'s [[Strike 4]]. Eric exited the band before the record was released and was replaced by Eliot Engelman.

==Member flux==
The close of 2001 saw the release of "[[Live Farewell 2001]]," which was to signify a hiatus for the band as the recording marked the final performance of Ethan Novak with the band, who left to form the band Cordy. He was replaced by [[Dan Brill]] who currently plays with the band.

Eliot Engelman left the band following the release of [[Anticore]] in 2006 and the following tour with [[Front Line Assembly]] in mid-2007, although the band maintained that he never left for a quite a while, before finally admitting it. Ethan Novak returned to play guitar during the "PsychoTransHumanoid" 2007 & 2008 tours of the east and west coasts with [[Cyanotic (band)|Cyanotic]], promoting the simultaneous release of Acumen Nation\'s [[Psycho the Rapist]] and DJ? Acucrack\'s [[Humanoids from the Deep (album)|Humanoids from the Deep]] and Cyanotic\'s [[Transhuman 2.0]].

June 21, 2012 Acumen Nation guitarist Jamie Duffy died due to an overdose of sleeping pills, which was made public via his personal Twitter account early that morning.  The tweet "this is how the end begins" <ref>[https://twitter.com/AcuJamie/status/215751753176588289 Last post on AcuJamie Twitter Account]</ref> along with a link to a photo <ref>[http://michaelcarrasquillo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Jamies_Last_Photo-Sleep_Aid_Pills.jpg Screenshot of Jamie Duffy\'s last post on via.me]</ref> of a plate with three white bottles of sleeping pills and a plate full of the bright blue pills themselves.

==Cold Waves: The Jamie Duffy Memorial Concert==
On July 6, 2012 the announcement was made for \'\'\'COLD WAVES: THE JAMIE DUFFY MEMORIAL CONCERT\'\'\' at Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s [[Bottom Lounge]] on September 7, 2012; celebrating his life in music. Duffy peers had deemed him as "one of the greatest stage managers and sound men that Chicago has seen."  Event artists include [[Paul Barker]], [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]], [[Chemlab|Jared Louche]], [[Martin Atkins]], [[Hate Dept|Steven Seibold]], [[Jim Marcus]], Jason Novak, and [[16volt|Eric Powell]] to perform selections by [[Revolting Cocks|Revco/Revolting Cocks]], [[Chemlab]], [[16volt]], Acumen Nation, [[Damage Manual]], [[Hate Dept]], [[The Clay People]], and Go Fight!/[[Die Warzau]]; additional artists to perform Czar, [[Cyanotic (band)|Cyanotic]], [[i:Scintilla]], and [[The Final Cut (band)|The Final Cut]]; with DJ sets by Zoltar, a former [[Q101 Chicago]] and [[WXRT]] Chicago radio host, and current host of the satellite radio show Subterranean.

}}
\'\'\'Attrition\'\'\' are an [[electronic music]] band, formed in [[Coventry]], England in 1980 by Martin Bowes and Julia Niblock. The band emerged from the experimental post-punk scene of the early 1980s and, along with other groups such as [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Coil (band)|Coil]], [[Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten]], and [[In the Nursery]], greatly contributed to the development of industrial music in the UK.<ref name="fearnet interview" /> Still active 30 years later, Attrition have been a stanchion of darkwave and industrial music, influencing many younger bands in the genres while continuously fine tuning their own distinctive sound.

==History==

===Beginnings===
In 1979, Martin started a xeroxed fanzine called \'\'Alternative Sounds\'\' to document the [[Coventry]] music scene (including such notables as [[The Specials]] and Furious Apples). The fanzine ran for 18 issues until 1981, and culminated in a vinyl compilation, "Sent from Coventry" (on [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]]) and a brief appearance on the BBC\'s \'\'[[Something Else (UK TV series)|Something Else]]\'\' programme. During this time, Martin met Julia at a local gig and, with the addition of Martin\'s brother Chris on guitar, Attrition was formed. In 1980 Chris was replaced by Julia\'s brother Ashley Niblock on synthesizer, and a short time later they replaced their live drummer with a drum machine; these changes facilitated Attrition\'s development beyond the post-punk of the early 80s into more experimental veins of sound.<ref name="biography" />

===1980s===
Influenced by [[Punk rock|punk]]\'s do-it-yourself aesthetic, Attrition took part in the emerging [[cassette culture]], contributing multiple early tracks to underground cassette compilations and fanzines alongside contemporaries such as [[Portion Control (band)|Portion Control]], [[Konstruktivits]], [[Chris & Cosey]], [[The Legendary Pink Dots]], [[Nurse with Wound]], and [[Coil (band)|Coil]]. Attrition\'s first album release came in the form of \'\'Death House\'\', a cassette of two experimental electronic soundtracks inspired by zombie films.<ref name="fearnet interview" /> In 1983, Attrition received their first exposure in the national music press through a review by Dave Henderson in his "Wild Planet" column in \'\'[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]\'\', which led to their "Dreamsleep" track appearing on Henderson\'s compilation \'\'[[The Elephant Table Album]]\'\', the band\'s first vinyl appearance. A postal collaboration with Seattle-based improvisational collective Audio Leter led to Attrition\'s second cassette album release, \'\'Action and Reaction\'\'. Attrition\'s first London concert followed, with a supporting slot from Coil, and the first European tour in April 1984 with the Legendary Pink Dots.

The debut album \'\'The Attrition of Reason\'\' appeared on Third Mind Records in autumn of 1984. The next year, Julia left the band to join the Legendary Pink Dots, and Bowes returned with new band members Marianne, Alex Novak, and Pete Morris to release the second proper Attrition album, \'\'Smiling, at the Hypogonder Club\'\', which was generally well received. The following year, however, this lineup dissolved and Bowes released \'\'In The Realm of the Hungry Ghosts\'\', a collection of rarities, compilation tracks, and B-sides from the preceding few years. This was the last release on Third Mind. The band then switched to Belgium\'s Antler-Subway Records for the release of "At the Fifitieth Gate" in 1988, which saw the addition of guitarist Gary Cox.<ref name="biography" />

===1990s===
After a short hiatus, Bowes began work on music once more and Julia rejoined Attrition in 1990. A compilation of songs from previous releases was released by [[Projekt Records]] in the USA, introducing Attrition to US audiences. "A Tricky Business" was released in 1991 on Italy\'s Contempo Records and marked a new era for the band. These US releases were complemented with European editions on German labels Hyperium and Trisol. \'\'The Hidden Agenda\'\' came out in 1993, followed by \'\'Ephemera\'\' in 1995, which mirrored the dark ambient nature of early album \'\'Death House\'\'.

1996 saw the release of \'\'3 Arms And A Dead Cert\'\', which showed an increased use of organic instruments, including orchestral elements.<ref name="3arms">{{cite web

  | title = 3 Arms And A Dead Cert

}}</ref> This album also was the first proper release on Projekt, a relationship that would continue for many years and would see the release of a succession of albums during the \'90s that saw progressed development of Attrition\'s signature sound. Also in 1996 the band toured the USA for the first time, at the culmination of which Julia left the band once more.<ref name="biography" /> The following year, Bowes revisited various works from the past decade of Attrition music and recorded new classical string variations of the songs, releasing them as \'\'Etude\'\'. After heavy touring in the late 1990s, including a stop at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], Attrition released \'\'The Jeopardy Maze\'\' in 1999.

===2000s===
Five years passed between \'\'The Jeopardy Maze\'\' and the next Attrition album, \'\'Dante\'s Kitchen\'\', released in 2004. During the interim a remix album and a rarities album were put out and the entire back catalog of Attrition was reissued on CD in Europe and the band focused on touring and playing live again. Attrition finally founded their own label, Two Gods, in 2006 and released \'\'Tearing Arms from Deities\'\', a 25th anniversary collection of material spanning Attrition\'s career, and \'\'Something Stirs - The Beginning\'\', a collection of many of their cassette compilation tracks from the early 1980s.<ref name="biography">{{cite web

In the early 1980s, Attrition was grouped into the post-punk movement, and as post-punk birthed subgenres and cross-pollinated with others, the band came to be seen as an early and influential part of the fledgling industrial and darkwave genres. Later on they would also gain a considerable following among the goth scene.<ref name="regen interview">{{cite web

}}</ref> and Attrition had developed its own distinctive electro-acoustic sound. This was based on Martin\'s deep growl, Julia\'s fretless bass work and breathy sub-operatic vocals, and a backline of electronic instrumentation, comprising analogue [[synthesizer]]s (including a [[Korg Mono/Poly]] and [[Korg MS-20]]), sequencer ([[Roland MC-202]]), drum machine ([[Roland TR-808]]), and various effects units. 

"At first, there wasn\'t the same sort of scene and we were in more of an \'industrial\' thing. There was nothing like the clubs you get now, it was actually quite difficult to play anywhere that would appreciate you. It\'s a lot easier now, it\'s not just Goth, it\'s a mix - Darkwave or whatever. That\'s gotten stronger, so that has helped, but really, we were there before it was built."<ref name="sordid">{{cite web

\'\'\'Bile\'\'\' is an [[industrial metal]] project based in the New York City, USA area. Although there has been so many different members throughout the bands career, Krztoff is the songwriting, recording and conceptual leader.  But the team of Krztoff and R.H.Bear are the ones driving the tank. The group has performed with as many as 11 and as small as 2 people on-stage. The early shows in 1993-1995 NY included a dominatrix and fire-breather. In 2013 they added Brendin Ross to the lineup as a keyboard player. In 2014 they introduced former Agnostic Front drummer Steve Gallo and Sagan Amery (Kaveat) on guitar.

==History==
Beginning in December 1992 Bile began as an art project to become the anti-band. Bored by being in simple jeans and t-shirt rock/metal bands and led by vocalist Krztoff, the band became the top drawing NYC live spectacle, which led to them signing with a NY based indie record label and released three albums on Energy Records, including their debut, \'\'[[Suckpump]]\'\', \'\'Teknowhore\'\' and \'\'Biledegradable\'\'. Following tours with [[Gwar]], [[16 Volt]], Evil Mothers and many many lineup changes, Krztoff became unsatisfied with Energy Records and negotiated his way off the label, inciting Krztoff and R.H. Bear (Krztoff\'s longtime friend and bandmate) to regroup and record for their own label, [[Bile Style Records]]. Krztoff recorded \'\'[[Sex Reflex]]\'\'. The album features their most popular song to date, "In League". Their song, "I Reject" appeared on the 1995 \'\'Mortal Kombat\'\' soundtrack. Their song "In League" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1998 [[Dee Snyder]] film \'\'Strangeland\'\'. Krztoff went on to join [[Pigface]] as guitarist in 2001. With help from Martin Atkins\' distribution conduit, Bile Style Records then released \'\'Nightmare Before Krztoff\'\' \'\'Black From The Dead\'\', \'\'Demonic Electronic\'\', \'\'The Copy Machine\'\', \'\'Frankenhole\'\' and \'\'Regurge" The Best o\' Bile\'\'. Selling thousands of records with virtually no promotion except their reputation and years of touring.

Krztoff coined the phrase "Demonic Electronic" to best describe their sound and live show since the band doesn\'t fit into any one genre. There are few bands on earth that truly share the Bile sound. Except that it\'s very extreme.

Bile has played and toured the U.S. extensively with artists such as Pigface, [[KMFDM]], [[Korn]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Ohgr]], Gwar, [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] AND [[Rammstein]].

When performing live, Bile consists of Krztoff (vocals, lead guitar), [[R. H. Bear]] (bass, effects), [[Brendin Ross]] (keyboard), [[Sagan Amery]] (guitar), and former Agnostic Front drummer Steve Gallo. Bile mainly uses drum machines and sequencers for their live experience.

In 2013, Bile released the album \'\'Built to Fuck, Born to Kill\'\' as a digital release online.

\'\'\'Cabaret Voltaire\'\'\' are an [[English people|English]] [[music]] [[musical ensemble|group]] from [[Sheffield]].

Initially composed of [[Stephen Mallinder]], [[Richard H. Kirk]], and [[Chris Watson (musician)|Chris Watson]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gimarc|first1=George|title=Punk diary : the ultimate trainspotter\'s guide to underground rock : 1970 - 1982|date=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-848-6|page=17}}</ref> the group was named after [[Cabaret Voltaire (Z\xc3\xbcrich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], a [[nightclub]] in [[Z\xc3\xbcrich]], [[Switzerland]], that was a centre for the early [[Dada]] movement.

Their earliest performances were Dada-influenced [[performance art]], but Cabaret Voltaire later developed into one of the most prolific and important groups to blend  [[electronic body music|industrial dance]], [[techno]], [[dub music|dub]], [[house music|house]] and experimental [[electronic music]] with [[popular music|pop]].

==History==
The band formed in [[Sheffield]] in 1973 and experimented widely with sound creation and processing. Some of these early experiments were first documented on the [[Industrial Records]] cassette \'\'1974-1976\'\' (1980), then later on the [[triple album]] [[Compact disc|CD]] set \'\'Methodology \'74/\'78: The Attic Tapes\'\' (Mute 2002). They eventually turned to live performance, often sharing the bill with [[Joy Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://uncommonpeople.co.uk/media-archive/bands/cabaret-voltaire |title=Cabaret Voltaire - Band Profiles |work=Uncommon People  |year=2014 |accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>  In one incident, Mallinder was hospitalised with a chipped [[Vertebral column|backbone]] after the band had objects thrown at them. However, the arrival of [[punk rock]] brought a more accepting audience for their [[industrial music|industrial]], electronic sound and they were championed by Sheffield punk [[fanzine]] \'\'Gunrubber\'\' edited by Paul Bower of local band 2.3.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 1978, Cabaret Voltaire signed to [[Rough Trade Records]]. With Rough Trade they released several acclaimed musically experimental [[single (music)|singles]] and [[Extended play|EPs]], including \'\'Extended Play\'\', "Nag Nag Nag" and "Three Mantras", and [[album]]s such as \'\'The Voice of America\'\' in 1980, and \'\'Red Mecca\'\' in 1981. The 27th June 1978 edition of NME had a review by Andy Gill who said "I firmly believe Cabaret Voltaire will turn out to be one of the most important new bands to achieve wider recognition this year. Wait and see." <ref>{{cite book|title=Punk Diary - the ultimate Trainspotters guide to underground rock|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-848-6|page=144}}</ref> And, certainly, years later they were seen as one of the bands that instigated the electronic music scene.

Watson left the band in 1981 to work for [[Tyne Tees Television]] and went on to found [[Hafler Trio|The Hafler Trio]] with Andrew M. McKenzie before becoming a [[BBC]] [[audio engineering|sound engineer]] and then a [[solo (music)|soloist]]. On 25 June 1981 the band performmed on the [[John Peel]] show and performed 4 songs recorded by the BBC Black Mask, Greensborough, Walls of jerico and Jazz the Glass.<ref>{{cite book|title=Punk Diary - the ultimate Trainspotters guide to underground roc|publisher=Bakbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-848-6|page=487}}</ref>

During this time, Cabaret Voltaire toured [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and [[United States|America]] without major [[record label]] support, releasing \'\'Hai!\'\', a [[live album]] [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] in Japan, in 1982.

In late 1982, Cabaret Voltaire decided consciously to turn in a more commercial direction. The group enlisted American dance music producer [[John Robie]] to remix "[[Yashar]]", a track from their 1982 album \'\'[[2x45]]\'\'. The [[12-inch single]] was released by [[Factory Records]] in May 1983, and received extensive play in dance clubs. In August 1983, the album \'\'[[The Crackdown]]\'\' was released on [[Some Bizzare]] / [[Virgin Records]] and reached number 31 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In 1984, the singles "Sensoria" and "James Brown" from the album \'\'[[Micro-Phonies (album)|Micro-Phonies]]\'\' (also on Virgin) charted on the [[UK Indie Chart]], as well as getting play in the underground dance scene.

In 1987, the band released \'\'[[Code (album)|Code]]\'\', followed by the [[house music|house]]-influenced \'\'Groovy, Laidback & Nasty\'\' in 1990. A series of completely [[instrumental]] works under the Cabaret Voltaire name were released on [[Instinct Records]] in 1993 and 1994. The last Cabaret Voltaire release to feature Mallinder on [[vocals]] was the \'\'[[Body and Soul (Cabaret Voltaire album)|Body and Soul]]\'\' album in 1991.

Since the mid-late 1980s, Kirk began a solo career under several names, including Electronic Eye and Sandoz, while Mallinder relocated to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Australia]] and records with a collaborator under the name Sassi & Loco and, more recently, in another collaborative effort the Kuling-Bros. Mallinder also helps run his own Offworld Sounds label and contributed to [[synthesizer]] and [[programming (music)|programming]] on [[Shaun Ryder]]\'s solo album \'\'Amateur Night at the Big Top\'\'.

In 1996, Mallinder reported to \'\'[[Inpress]]\'\' [[magazine]]\'s [[Andrez Bergen]] that "I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days - the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating tape loops and all that - has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin; in terms of the Dada thing, there\'s a similarity between the Dadaists\' reaction to the bourgeoisie and the war and our own position - we felt alienated from popular culture ourselves. I think those kinds of attitudes become embedded within you, but I\'m not sure how it relates now..."<ref>\'\'Vintage Cab Sav\'\', Andrez Bergen. \'\'Zebra\'\', \'\'[[Inpress]]\'\', 1996.</ref>

Hopes of a Cabaret Voltaire reunion were raised when Kirk dropped hints in the late 1990s, the most significant being in the notes of a reissue of \'\'Radiation\'\', but this never happened. In a special \'[[Depeche Mode]]/History of Electro-pop\' edition of \'\'[[Q (magazine)|Q]]\'\' magazine, Kirk suggested he is still considering resurrecting the Cabaret name, but this time he plans to "Get some young people involved".<ref name="SmuggledSoundsCabaretVoltaire">{{cite web |url=http://live-bootleg.blogspot.com/2006/11/cabaret-voltaire-three-mantras_13.html |title=Smuggled Sounds: Cabaret Voltaire: The Three Mantras |date=13 November 2006 |author= |accessdate=22 January 2010 }}</ref>

In 2001, Watson appeared in the documentary film \'\'[[Made in Sheffield]]\'\', where he discussed the early years of Cabaret Voltaire. Since that time, Kirk has resurrected the Cabaret Voltaire name and has released new albums with New Zealand band [[Kora (band)|Kora]] called \'\'Kora! Kora! Kora!\'\' and Sheffield band, The Tivoli called \'\'National Service Rewind\'\'. The new material was recorded at Western Works studios.

The experimental \'Sensoria Festival of Film and Music\' is named after the Cabaret Voltaire song, and has become an annual event held in Sheffield since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.sensoria.org.uk/ |title=Sensoria 2010 |publisher=2010.sensoria.org.uk |date= |accessdate=25 April 2014 }}</ref>

In July 2014, Berlin\'s Atonal Festival reported that Cabaret Voltaire were to perform at the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/cabaret-voltaire/78369 |title=Cabaret Voltaire to play first gig in 20 years at Berlin festival  |work=NME.com |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> The performance - the first in twenty years - will see a setlist of all new material performed by a line-up "consisting solely of machines, multi-screen projections and Richard H. Kirk", the lone remaining member of the \'group\'.

}}

\'\'\'Chemlab\'\'\' was an [[industrial rock]] band formed in [[Washington D.C.]], USA, in 1989 by Dylan Thomas More, Joe Frank, and Jared Louche (then known as Hendrickson). Influenced by the pioneers of the industrial genre, such as [[Throbbing Gristle]], Chemlab mixed experimental sounds with [[rock music|rock]] and [[heavy metal music|metal]], which they dubbed "Angel-Dustrial"{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. They released their first EP \'\'10 Ton Pressure\'\', parted ways with Frank and moved to [[New York City]], their base for the duration of their career. The band toured with acts such as [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[KMFDM]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[16volt]], and [[GWAR]].

After releasing the albums \'\'Burn Out At The Hydrogen Bar\'\' and \'\'East Side Militia\'\' on [[Fifth Colvmn Records]], Chemlab broke up in 1997 and then reformed in 2004 to release an album entitled \'\'Oxidizer\'\' with Jared as the only original member. After a seven-year hiatus from the stage, Jared recreated Chemlab and, with a backing band composed of the members of electro-industrial group mindFIELD performed a one-off show in Boston, Massachusetts in August 2005. The band played another one-off show, this time in New York City on January 7, 2006. A third show in San Francisco on March 17, 2006, saw the band joined by fellow coldwave bands [[Babyland]] and Deathline International. The band has recently played at the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]] and the [[Blacksun Festival]].

In late 2007 the band toured the US for the first time in eight years, with the supporting line-up of multi-instrumentalist/programmer Gabriel Shaw (mindFIELD), Wade Alin (Christ Analogue) and Jason Bazinet (SMP).<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26922_0_2_0_C Chemlab announce \'Detonation Days Tour 2007\']</ref>

During the spring of 2010, Chemlab toured North America with [[16Volt]] and [[Left Spine Down]].<ref>[http://coldwaves.net/albums/16volt/ 16Volt | The Coldwaves Festival]</ref>

Jared Louche announced on stage during a performance on September 7th 2012 in Chicago, that it would be the band\'s final show.<ref>[http://www.idieyoudie.com/2012/09/cold-waves-breaking-reflections-on-the-jamie-duffy-memorial-concert/ Cold Waves Breaking]</ref>

===2000-present===
To greet the 21st century, Chris & Cosey became \'\'\'Carter Tutti\'\'\', celebrating the rebirth with a series of concerts which were documented on the live album \'\'LEM Festival October 2003\'\'.  The rebirth was completed by the release of the studio album \'\'Cabal\'\' later that year.  Both also appeared as guests on the 2006 [[Current 93]] album \'\'[[Black Ships Ate the Sky]]\'\'.

Carter and Tutti re-engaged with [[Throbbing Gristle]], which reformed with all four original members for a December 2004 [[All Tomorrow\'s Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow\'s Parties]] festival appearance, and recorded several new studio albums over the following years - \'\'[[TG Now]]\'\' (2004) and \'\'[[Part Two (Throbbing Gristle album)|Part Two]]\'\' (2007). They also performed a short series of concerts in Europe and the United States in 2009, with a rare tour-only release album, \'\'[[The Third Mind Movements]]\'\'. (Ostensibly, the few remaining copies were sold via mail-order through the Throbbing Gristle website<ref>{{cite web|title=Throbbing Gristle.com Shop Front|url=http://tg.greedbag.com/dept/~shop-front-12/|publisher=Throbbinggristle.com|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> upon completion of the tour).

In October 2010 Throbbing Gristle began a European tour; however, several days following the band\'s first tour date at the Hackney Dissenting Academy,<ref>{{cite web|title=THROBBING GRISTLE : HACKNEY DISSENTING ACADEMY|url=http://ticketshop.greedbag.com/buy/throbbing-gristle-hackney-dissen/|publisher=HACKNEY DISSENTING ACADEMY #1.2|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> London, Throbbing Gristle\'s website announced that [[Genesis P-Orridge]] was no longer willing to perform with the band, and would return to his home in New York. Chris, Cosey and [[Peter Christopherson|Peter \'Sleazy\' Christopherson]] finished the tour without P-Orridge, performing under the name X-TG.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THROBBING GRISTLE!|url=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com/|publisher=http://throbbing--gristle.blogspot.com/|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=X-Industrial|url=http://sleazybkk.blogspot.com/|publisher=http://sleazybkk.blogspot.com/|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>

Carter and Tutti performed with Nik Colk Void of [[Factory Floor]] at [[Mute Records|Mute]]\'s Short Circuit Festival in May 2011.  A live album of the show, with an additional studio track, was released as \'\'Transverse\'\' in 2012, under the name Carter Tutti Void.<ref>[http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16431-transverse/ Pitchfork Media: Carter Tutti Void: Transverse]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mute to Release \xe2\x80\x98Transverse\xe2\x80\x99|url=http://straighttovideo.org/2012/01/mute-to-release-transverse/|publisher=Straight To Video|accessdate=20 April 2012|author=R.

\'\'\'Chrome\'\'\' is an American [[experimental rock]] group founded in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1975.

Chrome took part of their inspiration for their rough and sometimes chaotic music from [[punk rock|punk]] pioneers like [[The Stooges]]. The sound of the group was often coarse and featured heavy elements of feedback and distortion. Their experiments in mixing synthesized noise with rock instrumentation have been cited as a forerunner of [[industrial rock]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chrome-mn0000118327 |title=Chrome \xe2\x80\x93 Music Biography, Credits and Discography : AllMusic |last=Bush |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
Chrome was formed in 1975 by [[Damon Edge]] (real name Thomas Wisse: drums, vocals, synths, production) and Gary Spain (bass guitar, violin) in San Francisco. They recorded and released their first album, \'\'[[The Visitation (Chrome album)|The Visitation]]\'\', along with John Lambdin (guitar) and Mike Low (guitar, vocals).<ref name="staticwhitesound.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.staticwhitesound.com/chrome/history.htm |title=Official Chrome Website \xe2\x80\x93 History |date=May 30, 2002 |work=staticwhitesound.com |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> After recording \'\'The Visitation\'\', Edge sent the album to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers]] to see if they wanted to release the album. A Warner Brothers A&R representative told Edge that the album sounded like a "messed up [[The Doors|Doors]] album"; to Damon Edge, this was a compliment. The label did not release the album, so Edge set up his own label, Siren Records. Edge was 19 years old when \'\'The Visitation\'\' was released.<ref name="Mullen">{{cite web |url=http://www.damonedge.com/ |title=Damon Edge Memorial Site |last=Mullen |first=Andrew |work=damonedge.com |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> After the recording of the first album, singer Mike Low left the band, to be replaced by new guitarist [[Helios Creed]].<ref name="staticwhitesound.com"/>

Chrome\'s commercial and artistic breakthrough came in 1978 with their second album, \'\'[[Alien Soundtracks]]\'\'. The album began as \'\'Ultra Soundtrack\'\', a soundtrack for a radical San Francisco strip show, but was rejected for being too radical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/unsung/albumofthemonth/1447/ |title=Julian Cope Presents Head Heritage <nowiki>| Unsung | Album of the Month |</nowiki> Chrome \xe2\x80\x93 Chromeology |work=headheritage.co.uk |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> During recording, Chrome largely abandoned conventional rock compositions, instead employing cut-up and collage techniques and heavily processed sound to create a kind of sci-fi punk style. The album was given 4 out of 5 stars in the UK music paper \'\'[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]\'\', and Chrome began gradually to gain a cult reputation in the UK and in Europe.

After recording \'\'Alien Soundtracks\'\', John Lambdin left the band. Their third studio album, \'\'[[Half Machine Lip Moves]]\'\', was released in 1979. \'\'Half Machine Lip Moves\'\' continued in the vein of the previous album, but heavier, with Creed\'s feedback guitar more to the fore. Edge\'s rough and ready drumming on this album included hitting pieces of scrap metal. \'\'Half Machine Lip Moves\'\' remains their best known work, and was listed at number 62 in \'\'[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]\'\' list of "100 Records That Set the World on Fire (While No One Was Listening)".<ref>{{cite journal |date=September 1998 |title=100 Records That Set the World on Fire (When No One Was Listening) |magazine=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=175}}</ref>

\'\'Half Machine Lip Moves\'\' and their 1979 EP \'\'[[Read Only Memory (EP)|Read Only Memory]]\'\' cemented the band\'s growing reputation in the UK and led to the band being signed to [[Beggars Banquet Records]] for their fourth album, \'\'[[Red Exposure]]\'\'. By this time Chrome consisted solely of Edge and Creed. The album marked a move away from the more frenetic style of the two previous albums, with more use of drum machines and synthesizers.

In 1980, Edge married [[Fabienne Shine]]. She went on to collaborate with him on several Chrome albums; her vocals appear on the album \'\'[[3rd from the Sun]]\'\'.

After a further EP and single, Chrome again expanded to a quartet with the addition of the new rhythm section of John and Hilary Stench (real surname: Haines). This lineup existed circa 1980\xe2\x80\x931983, and produced the albums \'\'[[Blood on the Moon (album)|Blood on the Moon]]\'\' (1981) and \'\'3rd from the Sun\'\' (1982), and the new material comprising the fifth LP of the 1982 \'\'[[Chrome Box]]\'\' set (subtitled \'\'Chronicles I\'\' and \'\'Chronicles II\'\'). The \'\'Chronicles\'\' material was also released in France as an album titled \'\'Raining Milk\'\', and would later be reissued in much longer versions on the distinct albums \'\'Chronicles I\'\' and \'\'Chronicles II\'\'. The title track from \'\'3rd from the Sun\'\' was covered by the band [[Prong (band)|Prong]] on their 1989 album \'\'[[Beg to Differ]]\'\'.

In 1983, Edge moved to [[Paris]]. Shine introduced him to her band and a new lineup of Chrome was formed. Edge and his wife would later separate. Edge continued to release albums with various (mainly Europe-based) musicians under the Chrome moniker over the next decade.

In August 1995, Edge was found dead in his [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] apartment in California; the cause of death was heart failure. Edge had been in contact with Creed and talked about reforming Chrome.<ref name="Mullen"/>

After she and Edge separated, Shine continued to compose songs. In 1997, after Edge\'s death, she released an album titled \'\'No Mad Nomad\'\'. The title referred to her late husband. In 2004, she began working and touring again with Creed.

A Creed-led version of Chrome that featured previous members John and Hilary Stench released a series of albums and toured between 1997 and 2001. In recent years, Creed has reactivated the Chrome name.

==Musical style==
While studying at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], Edge became influenced in making unusual sounds; this progressed after a trip to [[Morocco]] where he heard a lot of Arabic music.<ref name="Mullen"/> In his head he began putting a beat behind the music and started coming up with ideas for songs. Chrome\'s music contained a lot of atmosphere in the sound production, featuring three- and eight-note melodies, usually layered with an atonal drone backed by a rhythm section.<ref name="Mullen"/> This sort of atmosphere was influenced by the music he had heard in Morocco. About six months after that trip, Edge began forming a band and recording his new music.<ref name="Mullen"/> During the 1970s, Chrome\'s music did not fit into any particular music scene in America. People found it hard to know how to book the band, or deal with promoting and distributing their music.<ref name="Mullen"/>

\'\'\'The Clay People\'\'\' is an [[Industrial music|industrial rock]] band based in [[Albany, New York]]. Singer-programmer Daniel Neet has been the only constant member throughout the band\'s history, leading the group as its sound has evolved to incorporate gothic, industrial and metal influences. Neet is also a member of the band Iron Lung Corp.

Originally known as "Clay People," the group added "The" to their name with the release of a self-titled 1998 album, marking a change in direction toward a less-synthetic/sampled approach to live performance with a lineup featuring Neet, Brian McGarvey (guitar), Mike Guzzardi (guitar), D. Patrick Walsh (bass) and Dan Dinsmore (drums). \'\'The Clay People\'\' (1998 album) was produced by Neil Kernon for Slipdisc Records (a Mercury affiliate); Kernon also worked with [[Queensr\xc3\xbfche]] and [[David Bowie]], among many others. It was the band\'s most commercially successful release, and songs from the record were included in the soundtracks to films \'\'[[Strangeland (film)|Strangeland]]\'\' and \'\'[[Universal Soldier: The Return]],\'\' as well as on the soundtracks to several video games. 

The band went on hiatus in the early 2000s as members pursued solo and side projects or launched new bands, including Idols Never Die<ref>[http://www.idolsneverdie.com/]</ref> and Black Incorporated featuring both Guzzardi and Dinsmore. A new album from The Clay People, \'\'Waking the Dead\'\', was released on May 22, 2007 via Overit Records with a lineup featuring only Neet, Dinsmore and McGarvey from the 1998 band.

Alongside the new release was a music video for the album\'s first single, "Supersonic Overdrive," directed by Jay Bender of Phobic Films.

In June of 2012, The Clay People reformed to perform the Jamie Duffy memorial show "Cold Waves". This show would include a line-up never seen before of the who\'s who of the industrial scene including long time friends [[Acumen Nation]], [[16 Volt]], [[Chemlab]], [[Hate Dept.]], Go Fight, [[I:Scintilla]], [[Cyanotic (band)|Cyanotic]], and members of the [[Revolting Cocks]].  This show would  make The Clay People active again putting them back into the studio.

\'\'\'Clock DVA\'\'\' are an [[industrial music|industrial]], [[post-punk]] and [[Electronic body music|EBM]] group from [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The group was formed in 1978 by Adolphus "Adi" Newton and Steven "Judd" Turner. Along with contemporaries [[Heaven 17]], Clock DVA\'s name was inspired by the [[Russia]]n-influenced [[Nadsat]] of [[Anthony Burgess]]\' \'\'[[A Clockwork Orange]]\'\';<ref>[http://www.aracnet.com/~jester/clockdva/discography.html Clock Dva discography] {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref> \'\'Dva\'\' is the Russian word for "[[2 (number)|two]]".

==History==

===1978\xe2\x80\x931981: \'\'White Souls in Black Suits\'\' and \'\'Thirst\'\' ===

Newton had previously worked with members of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] in a collective called The Studs and with [[Ian Craig Marsh]] and [[Martyn Ware]] in a band called [[The Human League#1977: .22The Dead Daughters.22 and .22The Future.22|The Future]]. He formed the first lineup of Clock DVA in 1978 with Judd Turner (bass), David J. Hammond (guitar), Roger Quail (drums) and Charlie Collins (saxophone, clarinet).

Clock DVA was originally known for making a form of [[experimental music|experimental]] electronic music involving treated [[tape loops]] and synthesizers such as the EMS Synthi E. Clock DVA became associated with [[industrial music]] with the 1980 release of their [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] [[album]] \'\'[[White Souls in Black Suits]]\'\' on [[Throbbing Gristle]]\'s [[Industrial Records]].<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (2003) \'\'The Great Indie Discography\'\', Canongate, ISBN 1-84195-335-0, p. 271-2</ref>

Paul Widger joined on guitar. The LP \'\'[[Thirst (Clock DVA album)|Thirst]]\'\', released on Fetish Records, followed in 1981 to a favourable critical reaction,<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title=The Guinness Who\'s Who of Indie and New Wave Music |year= 1992 |publisher=Guinness Publishing |isbn=0-85112-579-4 }}</ref> knocking [[Adam and the Ants]]\' \'\'[[Dirk Wears White Sox]]\'\' from the top of the [[NME]] Indie Charts, by which time the band had combined \'\'[[musique concr\xc3\xa8te]]\'\' techniques with standard rock instrumentation. "4 Hours", the single from \'\'Thirst\'\', was later covered by former [[Bauhaus]] bassist [[David J]] on his 1985 solo EP \'\'Blue Moods Turning Tail\'\'.

The band split up in 1981, with the non-original members of the band going on to form The Box.<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Alternative & Indie Discography |year= 1999 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=0-86241-913-1 }}</ref>

Turner died in September 1981 due to an accidental drug overdose.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/04817-heaven-17-interview-penthouse-and-pavement Martyn Ware interviewed in The Quietus]</ref>

===1982\xe2\x80\x931984: \'\'Advantage\'\' ===

In 1982, Newton formed a new version of the band. First releasing the single "High Holy Disco Mass" on the [[major label]] [[Polydor Records]] under the name \'\'\'DVA\'\'\', the band then released the album \'\'[[Advantage (album)|Advantage]]\'\' (with singles "Resistance" and "Breakdown") under the name Clock DVA. After a European tour in 1983, however, the band split acrimoniously. Adi Newton went on to form [[The Anti-Group]] or T.A.G.C.<ref name="Larkin" /> They released several albums continuing in a similar vein to the early Clock DVA, yet more experimental.

===1987\xe2\x80\x931994: \'\'Buried Dreams\'\', \'\'Man-Amplified\'\' and \'\'Sign\'\' ===

In 1987, Newton reactivated DVA and invited [[Dean Dennis]] and [[Paul Browse]] back into the fold to aid Newton\'s use of computer aided sampling techniques which he had been developing in The Anti Group. They released \'\'[[Buried Dreams]]\'\' (1989), an electronic album which received critical acclaim as a pioneering work.

Browse left the group in 1989 and was replaced by [[Robert E. Baker]]. The album \'\'[[Man-Amplified]]\'\' (1992), an exploration of cybernetics, was the next release. \'\'[[Digital Soundtracks]]\'\' (1992), an instrumental album, followed.

Following Dennis\'s departure from the group, Newton and Baker produced the album \'\'[[Sign (album)|Sign]]\'\' (1993).

===1995\xe2\x80\x932007: Hiatus===

After the release of \'\'Sign\'\' and related singles, Clock DVA toured Europe (line-up: Newton & Baker with [[Hafler Trio|Andrew McKenzie]] and Ari Newton) and Newton relocated to Italy. However, their Italian record label at the time, Contempo, folded which caused a number of problems. 
 
\'\'Collective\'\', an anthology album and a box set was released in 1994. Newton began working on new material with [[Lustmord|Brian Williams]], [[Graeme Revell]] (from [[SPK (band)|SPK]]) and [[Paul Haslinger]] but continued problems with record labels eventually caused Newton and Clock DVA take a long break from the music scene.<ref name="beekaboo">[http://www.peek-a-boo-magazine.be/en/interviews/clock-dva/ Clock DVA/Adi Newton interview in Peek-a-Boo Magazine]</ref>

In 1998, Czech record label [[Nextera]] released a reissue of \'\'Buried Dreams\'\', sanctioned by Dean Dennis and Paul Browse but not by Newton.

===2008\xe2\x80\x93present: Reactivation===

Adi Newton reactivated Clock DVA along with his creative partner Jane Radion Newton in 2008.

Since 2011 Clock DVA has performed at several electronic music festivals and venues throughout Europe <ref>[http://www.wave-gotik-treffen.de/english/bands.php Wave-Gotik-Treffen Bands and Artists 2011]</ref><ref>[http://industrialart.eu/festival/index.php?go=artists Wroclaw Industrial Festival 2011 Artists]</ref><ref>[http://2011.bimfest.be/en/bands/clock-dva/ BIMfest 2011 artists]</ref> with a new line-up consisting of Newton, Maurizio "TeZ" Martinucci and Shara Vasilenko.<ref>[http://www.filthforge.org/reports/reports-2011/report-moonlight-2011.htm Moonlight Festival concert review in Filth Forge]</ref>

In January 2012, German record label [[Vinyl on Demand]] announced \'\'Horology\'\', a vinyl box set compilation of early (1978\xe2\x80\x931980) Clock DVA material.<ref>[http://vinyl-on-demand.com/ Vinyl on Demand announcement]</ref>

A historical overview exhibition of Clock DVA (photographs, video and audio) took place at the Melkweg cultural centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands in February/March 2012.<ref>[http://www.melkweg.nl/artikelpagina.jsp?language=nederlands&batchno=1&offset=0&artikelid=237058&disciplineid=media&agendaitemid=237059 A Chronology of Dvation: The subversive & occult emergence of Clock DVA]</ref>

In July 2013, a new Clock DVA album called \'\'Post-Sign\'\' was released on Anterior Research. It was produced and composed by Adi Newton in 1994\xe2\x80\x9395 as an instrumental companion album to \'\'Sign\'\', though it remained unreleased at that time due to problems with record labels.<ref name="beekaboo" />

According to Adi Newton, [[Mute Records]] were set to re-release the eight Clock DVA albums remastered in a box set in 2012.<ref name="beekaboo" />

In 2013, Clock DVA played at the Incubate festival in Tilburg, The Netherlands.

In 2014, Clock DVA released the album \'\'Clock 2\'\' on a USB drive through their label Anterior Research. This limited edition release consists of 3 new studio tracks and various remixes of them, in addition to 4 video files. A 12" called \'\'Re-Konstructor / Re-Kabaret 13\'\' was released shortly after.

\'\'\'Collide\'\'\' is a music duo founded in 1992, in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[USA]], that has incorporated elements of [[trip hop]], [[synthpop]] and music from the Middle East into their sound. Their imagery is said{{By whom|date=April 2012}} to be a wicked and neo-dark version of [[Scheherazade]] [[Arabian Nights]] tales.

The name comes from the \'collision\' of musical styles, primarily the ethereal vocals provided by kaRIN and the electronic music provided by Statik. Collide\'s debut album, \'\'[[Beneath the Skin]]\'\', was released in 1996, followed by a remix album, \'\'[[Distort (album)|Distort]]\'\', in 1998 containing remixes by artists such as [[Kneel Cohn]] of the bands [[Spirits In Sin]] and [[The Dead Stars On Hollywood]].   Dissatisfied with the music industry, Collide started their own record label, Noiseplus Music, and in 2000, they released their second studio album, \'\'[[Chasing the Ghost]]\'\'. 

Three years later, they released their third studio album, \'\'[[Some Kind of Strange]]\'\'. The following year, the band released another remix album, \'\'[[Vortex (album)|Vortex]]\'\', containing remixes by numerous remix artists, including [[Charlie Clouser]]. Joining kaRIN and Statik this time around, and for their first live performances a little later in the year, were Scott Landes (guitar), Rogerio Silva (guitar), Chaz Pease (drums), and Kai Kurosawa ([[Warr Guitars|Warr Guitar]]/bass).

In 2005 Collide released a DVD, entitled \'\'[[Like the Hunted]]\'\', along with a live CD. Then they recorded with [[Curve (band)|Curve]]\'s [[Dean Garcia]] in a project called \'\'The Secret Meeting\'\'. The album, \'\'Ultrashiver\'\', was released under their Noiseplus label on June 26, 2007.  On September 23, 2008, the band released their fourth studio album \'\'[[Two Headed Monster (album)|Two Headed Monster]]\'\'.  Special guests on the album included [[Danny Carey]] from [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and Dean Garcia from Curve.

In Halloween of 2009, the album \'\'These Eyes Before\'\' was released. It\'s a 10 song album of cover versions of well-known songs by artists such as \'\'[[The Beatles]]\'\', \'\'[[Depeche Mode]]\'\', \'\'[[Radiohead]]\'\', and \'\'[[Pink Floyd]]\'\'. Currently, they are offering a free song in exchange for donations which will go towards the recording of a new album.<ref>http://www.collide.net/p/6916997175528292378</ref>

In January 2011, Collide was nominated for The 10th Annual [[Independent Music Awards]] under the Cover Song category for "The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum".<ref>http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima/artist/collide</ref>

\'\'\'Crash Worship\'\'\' or ADRV (Adoraci\xc3\xb3n De Rotura Violenta) was a [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] based experimental-aktionist-industrial-noise performance group formed in 1986,<ref name="charnel"/> most renowned for its live shows in which three stand-up percussionists hammered out concussive poly-rhythms to abstract mutated guitar, synthesizers, effects and dueling vocalists. Audience members were showered in various substances such as blood, wine and honey while band members ignited combustibles and fire within the performance area.<ref name="allmusic">{{Cite web| url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p144269|pure_url=yes}} | title = Crash Worship | last = Bush | first = John | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = 2008-07-08}}</ref> Crash Worship also released several albums and singles of both live and studio-recorded music. Mostly self produced (unusually packaged and laboriously handcrafted) works in visually stunning screen printed metal splattered with paint, urine, blood and other esoterica.<ref name="Waldteufel Interview">{{cite interview | title = Markus Wolff | interviewer = Malahki Thorn | url = http://www.heathenharvest.com/article.php?story=20041202132419669 | accessdate = 2010-05-11 | date = 2010-12-02}}</ref> Although they toured playing their recorded material, the celebratory nature of these events left each show open to spontaneity and improvisation.<ref name="warehouse">{{cite interview | title = Crash Worship | interviewer = Chris Christian | url = http://www.sonic-boom.com/interview/crash.worship.interview.html | accessdate = 2008-07-08 | date = 1995-05-05 | city = [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]]}}</ref>

==Biography==
Initially starting as a studio project, Crash Worship soon learned the power of a live audience.<ref name="pukka">{{cite interview | last = Cheffins | first = Simon | interviewer = John Eden; Justin Mitchell | title = Pukka Crusher | url = http://uncarved.org/music/adrv.int.html | accessdate = 2008-07-08}}</ref> During performances, the band\'s members (or often provocateurs) would manipulate the crowd, involving them more deeply into the show, ultimately eliminating any boundaries between spectator and performer.<ref name="warehouse"/> The musicians would also mobilize their instruments on and off the stage into the middle of the audience (or outside), lighting explosives and hosing down the crowd with various liquids creating an atmosphere of celebratory abandon and mirth. Strobe lights, nudity, mysterious liquids, sex and smoke filled rooms (at next to zero visibility) were all a part of the average show.<ref name="Zog saw Crash Worship LIVE!">{{cite news | title = Zog saw Crash Worship LIVE! | interviewer = Zog Archer | url = http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/stories/scrashzg.html | accessdate = 1995-01-16 | date = 2010-09-13 | location = [[New York City, New York]]}}</ref> The chaos of these events often invited unwanted attention from police who would later forcibly shut down a large percentage of the band\'s performances.<ref name="pukka"/>

===BLOOD & FIRE===
After much successful touring of the [[United States]], Crash Worship followed suit with two full European tours in the mid-90s. It was also around this time the band was deemed "unmanageable" by many labels, booking agencies and clubs which proved difficult to tour much afterward. Although at the height of notoriety, Crash Worship had been banned from countless cities across the [[United States]] making it almost impossible touring there or abroad.<ref name="Aktionskunst And Primitivism">{{cite interview | title = Aktionskunst And Primitivism | interviewer = Alexander Nym | url = http://unartignyc.com/2010/09/13/cw/ | accessdate = 2010-10-25 | date = 2010-09-13 | location = [[New York City, New York]]}}</ref>

In late 1999, the last Crash Worship performances were held in California, four being with the [[Master Musicians of Jajouka]] (in the Bay Area), the Aztlan Theatre (abandoned Los Angeles County Jail), and to a female only audience in [[San Francisco]]. The final Crash Worship performance was held in [[San Diego]], California on October 24, 1999, with [[Physics (band)|Physics]] and [[Tarantula Hawk (band)|Tarantula Hawk]] as openers. Members are now scattered around the U.S. in [[New Orleans]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[New York City]], [[San Diego]] and the [[Bay Area]], active with their own solo and side projects.<ref name="weirdestband">{{Cite web| url = http://weirdestbandintheworld.com/2010/10/16/crash-worship/ | title = Crash Worship weirdest band in the world | last = Band | first = Weirdest | publisher = [[weirdestband]] | accessdate = 2010-10-16}}</ref>

}}

\'\'\'Crossbreed\'\'\' was a six member [[industrial metal]] band from Clearwater, Florida, formed in 1996. They were signed with [[Artemis Records]] before being dropped from the label in 2003. The band released two EPs and three full-length albums before disbanding in 2010.

==History==
===Early years===
Crossbreed was formed in 1996 as a four-man band consisting of James Rietz, Chris Nemzek, Charlie Parker & Travis Simpkins. A year later they added keyboardist Jason Troph who left in 1998 to front the Orlando-based band Irrational.  He was replaced by Phil "Flip" Marquardt.  Their self-produced album \'\'.01\'\' was released in 1998 with only 1,000 copies made; the album featured a cover version of "[[Wicked Game]]" by [[Chris Isaak]]. 

In 1999, Dan "DJ" Izzo (then under the moniker "D.J. Balistick") joined the band as their DJ/2nd Keyboardist.  It was at this time that he began developing their stage show using black lights and glow paint, which helped bring the band to the attention of the music industry.

===2000-2005===
On April 29, 2000 Crossbreed played Tampa\'s [[WXTB|98Rock]]\'s radio festival, [[Livestock (concert series)|Livestock]], where they met the girls from the band [[Kittie]].  They gave them a copy of their 3-Track demo, which found its way to the A & R Rep for Kittie\'s former label [[Artemis Records|Artemis]].  Crossbreed was signed to [[Artemis Records|Artemis]] by the end of the year and their debut album, \'\'[[Synthetic Division (album)|Synthetic Division]]\'\' was released nationally on May 8, 2001.  Their first single, "[[Underlined]]", debuted on [[MTV2]] & [[MTVX]].  The video for that song was nominated for a [[Billboard Music Award]].  In the summer of 2001 they toured the U.S. and Canada with the German band [[Rammstein]] and did a short run with [[Static-X]]. \'\'Synthetic Division\'\' has sold to date a total of over 100,000 copies. In what would be a sign for the future, bassist Charlie Parker left the band after a show on April 20, 2002.  Crossbreed then parted ways with their label in 2003 and after a show with [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]] on May 2, 2004, bassist Bishop, keyboardist "Flip", and drummer Simpkins left the band as well.  Later that year, Izzo would also leave the band.  James Rietz & Chris Nemzek chose to continue and re-form the band with new members.

===2005 - 2010===
With a new line-up and manager ([[Bill Aucoin]], former manager of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]), Crossbreed spent their time writing new material and doing shows in Florida, including opening for [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]], [[Mushroomhead]], and [[Mindless Self Indulgence]].  On July 25, 2005 they released their self-produced EP \'\'[[New Slave Nation]]\'\' and toured the Midwest with [[Mushroomhead]] and [[Dope (band)|Dope]] on the "Music for Freedom" Tour. The following spring, they went out with [[Nothingface]] and [[Silent Civilian]] for a brief time before dropping off the tour due to conflict. Since that time they have toured again with [[Mushroomhead]] as well as alone throughout the Eastern U.S.

As of May 14, 2008, it was noted on Subkulture\'s [[Myspace]] Blog that Kem Secksdiin is co-writing and performing numerous songs on the upcoming Crossbreed album.

In July 2008, Crossbreed opened up their own audio-visual recording studio. Dubbed "The Candy Factory", the studio is located in the warehouse district of Downtown Clearwater, Florida and served as the studio where Crossbreed\'s new record [[KE 101]] was recorded.

In June 2008, Crossbreed signed with "Driven Music Group", the new label of ex-[[Korn]] guitarist, [[Brian "Head" Welch]]. According to the band\'s [http://www.myspace.com/crossbreed MySpace], their new album [[KE 101]] was scheduled to be released in late spring/early summer 2009 via Ryko distribution, but due to the company going under, they have decided to sign with Crash Music, an affiliate of Driven Music Group. Due to this and several other issues, the new album [[KE 101]] was released on September 15, 2009.

Crossbreed played their last show on December 17, 2010 at The State Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida.

===Hiatus and other projects===

Members of Crossbreed James Rietz and Ian Hall teamed up with Tamara Kemp to form a Super-Mega Group called Shu-Tang.
They released their first EP "Drink Til You\'re Hott" on March 1, 2011 and sold over 5,000,000 downloads in the first week.<ref>http://www.theprp.com/2010/05/13/news/crossbreed-go-on-hiatus/</ref>

On September 2012, they released a new video for the song "Dance Like A Zombie", and retired from the business..<ref>http://www.theprp.com/2010/05/13/news/crossbreed-go-on-hiatus/</ref>

Kem Secksdiin released an album called [eMerGe-n-EvoLve] on January 12th, 2010. The album features guest appearances from Crossbreed\'s singer James Breed on the song "Night (Replace The day)" and F@mu$ (aka Famus, also known for work with XXX Car Ride) for the song "rEZuRekdEAD".

\'\'\'C-Tec\'\'\' was a band originally formed as a [[side project]] in 1995 by [[Jean-Luc De Meyer]] (of [[Front 242]]), Jonathan Sharp (of [[New Mind (band)|New Mind]]), and Ged Denton (of Crisis NTI) as \'\'\'The Cyber-Tec Project\'\'\'. The name was taken from [[Cyber-Tec Records]], who released their [[Let Your Body Die (Cyber-Tec album)|first album]].  This EP was also released on [[Fifth Column Records]] in the US.  After this release, Jonathan Sharp left the band (due to problems with Cyber-Tec Records manager Paul M. Green), and [[Marc Heal]] (of [[Cubanate]]) joined as a full-time member.  

The band had been conceived as a one-off project, but the members at this point decided to pursue further material.  In 1997, after shortening their name to C-Tec, they released a full album, \'\'[[Darker (album)|Darker]]\'\', on the US industrial [[Wax Trax!]] label. 

C-Tec existed during the late 1990s hiatus in the Front 242 line-up, with De Meyer (the original lead singer in 242) apparently leaving that band for a period. The band toured North America twice in 1998 with a hybrid lineup featuring other members of Cubanate and [[Julian Beeston]], one time drummer in [[Nitzer Ebb]]. The second album, \'\'[[Cut (C-Tec album)|Cut]]\'\', was released in 2000 on [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] imprint [[Synthetic Symphony]].  The album was originally slated for US release on Wax Trax! but the label closed around this time.  Thereby, \'\'Cut\'\' never had an official American release.

In terms of how C-Tec sounded, \'\'Darker\'\' contains a surprisingly downbeat, moody collection of songs, showing strong electronic influences but with more ambient textures than would be suggested by the [[industrial music]] backgrounds of the main participants. \'\'Cut\'\' is faster in tempo, with De Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s vocal mixed low. Most of the material on the two full-length C-Tec albums was co-written by Marc Heal and Jean-Luc De Meyer. 

Since \'\'Cut\'\', C-Tec appears to have been inactive, though lead singer Jean-Luc De Meyer later resurfaced with a new Front 242 album in 2003.

}}
\'\'\'Death in June\'\'\' are a [[neofolk]] group led by [[England|English]] [[folk music]]ian Douglas Pearce, better known as [[Douglas P.]] The band was originally formed in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1981 as a trio, but after the other members left in 1984 and 1985 to work on other projects, the group became the work of Douglas P.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and various collaborators. Douglas P. now lives in [[Australia]].

Over the band\'s three decades of existence, they have made numerous shifts in style and presentation, resulting in an overall shift from initial [[post-punk]] and [[Industrial Records]] influence to a more acoustic and folk music-oriented approach. They are sometimes considered controversial (largely due to usage of themes and imagery relating to [[Nazi Germany]]). Douglas P.\'s influence was instrumental in sparking [[neofolk]], of which his music has subsequently become a part.

==History==

{{Empty section|date=February 2015}}

===Origin===
{{main|Crisis (band)}}
<!--  Commented out: [[Image:Dij-10.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Early Death in June. From left to right: Douglas P., Tony Wakeford and Patrick Leagas.]] -->
Pearce formed Death in June in 1981 in [[England]], along with [[Patrick Leagas]] and [[Tony Wakeford]]. Pearce and Wakeford had been members of the political punk band [[Crisis (band)|Crisis]], which formed in 1977. Crisis had gained a substantial following in the UK [[punk subculture]]. Crisis performed at rallies for The Right to Work, [[Rock Against Racism]], and the [[Anti-Nazi League]].

====Early Death in June (1981\xe2\x80\x931985)====
Death in June soon left the reticent{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} punk scene behind and began to infuse their sound with [[electronics]] and [[martial music|martial]] style [[drum]]ming, combined with a [[Joy Division]]-influenced post-punk sound.  Their lyrics maintained much of the [[poetry]] and political urgency of the early Crisis recordings. Tracks such as the early single sides "Holy Water" and "State Laughter" demonstrated an ongoing fascination with political systems. Further on, Douglas P. would abandon any overt interest in politics in favor of a more [[esoteric]] approach to his work.

====Introduction of folk music====
For 1983\'s \'\'[[The Guilty Have No Pride]]\'\' LP, Death in June began to adopt a more traditional European folk sound, using more acoustic guitars, references to ancient and contemporary European history, and combining heavy percussion with electronic soundscapes and post-industrial experimentation.

====\'\'Nada!\'\' flirtation with dance music====
The \'\'[[Nada!]]\'\' (1985) LP introduced a temporary dance sound to Death in June accompanied by other tracks with the previously introduced folk elements. Douglas P. would later state this period was brought about by Patrick Leagas, which is further justified by Leagas\' other work as [[Sixth Comm]] and later by his joining [[Mother Destruction]], where he would further explore themes of [[Germanic paganism]] and historically-inspired music.

====Patrick Leagas departs====
Patrick Leagas abruptly left the group in April 1985 after a tour of Italy, resulting in many cancelled shows in the UK and Europe due to follow that tour. Leagas, who began calling himself [[Patrick Leagas|Patrick O-Kill]], later formed Sixth Comm. From that point until the present, Death in June has consisted solely of the work of Douglas P. and various collaborators.

===Mid-period Death in June (1985\xe2\x80\x931996)===

====Creation of World Serpent Distribution====
In 1991, Douglas P. named and helped form [[World Serpent Distribution]];<ref name="WSDNAME">Douglas P. stated in 2002, in [http://www.deathinjune.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Interview:2003-Yahoo_Groups_3 a post on the official Death in June Yahoo group]: "In turn, I have sold back to world serpent distribution my shares in the company that I actually named and help form in early 1991."</ref> a British distribution company that specialized in esoteric, experimental and post-industrial music, which would distribute his [[New European Recordings|NER]] releases until the late 1990s. During this period, Pearce collaborated with many artists who also had material distributed through the company in various ways.

====Collaboration with David Tibet====
[[David Tibet]] formed [[Current 93]] in 1982. After being introduced to Douglas P. by Alan McGee of Creation Records at the Living Room Club, London in 1983, Tibet eventually began working with Death in June.  Upon meeting Tibet, Douglas P. began to devote more of his time to a new circle of collaborators, who introduced him to various [[Thelema|Thelemic]], [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] disciplines that markedly affected his approach to composing music. Familiar with the [[Runic alphabet]], Douglas P. introduced them to Tibet. Tibet similarly had been long interested in [[magic and religion]] and implemented these concepts in his early recordings with Current 93.

Douglas P. introduced a folk influence to Current 93/David Tibet, who in turn contributed to Death in June\'s \'\'Nada!\'\' (1985) LP and its remix version titled \'\'[[93 Dead Sunwheels]]\'\' (1989), as well as the albums \'\'[[The World That Summer]]\'\', \'\'[[Brown Book (album)|Brown Book]]\'\', and \'\'[[The Wall of Sacrifice]]\'\'. He continued his work with Death in June, ending their collaborations with a contribution to the (1995) LP, \'\'[[Rose Clouds of Holocaust]]\'\' before their eventual split.

====Collaboration with Boyd Rice begins====
Experimental musician [[Boyd Rice]] was a friend of the group and had documented one of their earliest performances back in 1982. He was later invited to contribute a spoken word piece to [[The Wall of Sacrifice]] LP. From then on, a long series of recording collaborations continued between Boyd Rice and Douglas P. which included the albums [[Music, Martinis and Misanthropy]], [[In the Shadow of the Sword (album)|In the Shadow of the Sword]], [[Heaven Sent (Scorpion Wind album)|Heaven Sent]], [[God & Beast]], [[Wolf Pact]], and finally [[Alarm Agents]]. Douglas P. also made a small appearance acting alongside Boyd Rice in the film [[Pearls Before Swine (film)|Pearls Before Swine]] directed by [[Richard Wolstencroft]].

====Collaboration with LJDLP====
[[Les Joyaux De La Princesse]] collaborated with Douglas P. on the \'\'[[Les Joyaux De La Princesse & Death in June : \xc3\x96stenbr\xc3\xa4un|\xc3\x96stenbr\xc3\xa4un]]\'\' double cassette release. Douglas P. sent LJDLP source material, which LJDLP would remix and send back after making any musical or aesthetic changes.<ref name="OSTENBRAUN">[http://industrialmusic.ru/ljdlp/text/interview/ Interview with LJDLP via the French \'\'Raven\'s Chat\'\' webzine.] it states: \'\'"First, it was only planned to edit an interview with Douglas P., the text for \xe2\x80\x9cDeath in June Collaboration : Carried Away By Despair\xe2\x80\x9d, used as a womb, is gone after. Douglas was apparently very enthusiastic about the music I sent to him. At the time, he wrote me : \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a similar path!..\xe2\x80\x9d. The use I was doing of the Poly-800 inspired to him, I think, like a kind of following to \xe2\x80\x9cThe World That Summer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6 This same keyboard was used as a base-line for the release of the double album but I learnt this after and in my ingenuousness, maybe, I had completed something! During this collaboration, at every musical as well aesthetic change, I sent it to Douglas\xe2\x80\xa6 That took me a lot of time to have his entire approbation and his benediction when the product was finished."\'\' [sic]</ref> Douglas P. would later appear live with Les Joyaux De La Princesse for a joint show in 2001.<ref name="LJDLPDIJLIVE">Heimdallr webzine, [http://www.heimdallr.ch/Live_Reports/2001/Brusselsgb.html \'\'Death in June - Tribe of Circle - Les Joyaux de la Princesse - Der Blutharsch Brussels - 1st December 2001\'\' live review]</ref>

====Collaboration with John Murphy begins====
Douglas P. having recently moved to [[Australia]], came back into contact with [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]] of [[Knifeladder]] and previously of [[SPK (band)|SPK]]. Murphy began playing live percussion with Death in June during tours from 1996 onwards. From 2000 a period of very stripped down, largely acoustic live performances for Death in June began up until Douglas P. announced no further live shows in 2005. In September 2011 a European tour was announced commemorating the 30th anniversary of the group\'s foundation in 1981. However the tour started off in Sydney, Australia without the actual inclusion of John Murphy.

===Contemporary Death in June (1996\xe2\x80\x93present)===

====Collaboration with Albin Julius Martinek====
After queuing to meet his idol Douglas P. backstage at a performance in Munich in December 1996, [[Albin Julius Martinek]] of [[Der Blutharsch]] later collaborated and toured throughout Europe between 1998-2000 with Death in June. Together, they produced the albums \'\'[[Take Care & Control]]\'\' and \'\'[[Operation Hummingbird (album)|Operation Hummingbird]]\'\', as well as the live album \'\'[[Heilige!]]\'\'. In comparison to previous Death In June works these were remarkably extroverted yet plagiaristic, courtesy of Martinek\'s contributions, sampling musical motifs from the likes of [[Richard Wagner]], [[Franz Schubert]], French 1960s pop icon [[Serge Gainsbourg]] amongst others. This resulted in a bombastic, neoclassical, post-industrial and extremely martial sound with few traces of the previous folk elements. The music created during this period could be classified as a part of the [[Martial industrial|martial music]] genre which Pearce had initiated in 1986 on "[[The World That Summer]]" album with tracks like \'Death Of A Man\' and again in 1989 on "[[The Wall Of Sacrifice]]" album with the title track and \'Death Is A Drummer\'. Pearce wrote a song loosely inspired by an untitled Der Blutharsch song for the \'\'[[Fire Danger Season]]\'\' Der Blutharsch tribute compilation. The track title was later created/revealed as "Many Enemies Bring Much Honour", which also appears on the rework and rarities album entitled \'Abandon Tracks!\'

====Demise of World Serpent Distribution====
The late 1990s marked the beginning of a court case between Death in June and World Serpent Distribution regarding payment and distribution issues with several other artists that were then on the label. This led to many artists that had sided with or had a similar experience to Pearce\'s leaving the distribution company and largely moving to [[Tesco Organisation|Tesco Distribution]] Germany, as well as other then well established labels such as [[Eis & Licht]].Eventually, Pearce was issued an out of court settlement for the case, which, according to him, led to the demise of World Serpent Distribution.<ref name="WSDDEMISE">Powell, Erin. [http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php?title=Interview:2005-Heathen_Harvest 2005 interview with Douglas Pearce].</ref> This led to reissues of most of the major albums in the Death in June discography being made freely available, with overhauled, deluxe packaging and a considerably cheaper price.

====Collaboration with Andreas Ritter====
On the \'\'[[All Pigs Must Die (album)|All Pigs Must Die]]\'\' LP, Pearce was assisted by [[Andreas Ritter]] of the neofolk group [[Forseti (band)|Forseti]] who played [[accordion]] on a few tracks on the first half of the LP. This marked a return to the previous folk sound of Death in June. Death in June have also appeared live with Forseti and Pearce appeared on Forseti\'s \'\'[[Windzeit]]\'\' LP.

After Andreas Ritter suffered a stroke and subsequent loss of memory and ability to play musical instruments, Pearce contributed acoustic versions of Death in June songs to a tribute album to Ritter entitled \'\'Forseti Lebt\'\' released in August 2006.

====Collaboration with Boyd Rice ends====
After completing the \'\'[[Alarm Agents]]\'\' LP, Pearce announced it would be his final collaboration with Rice, citing the decision as having been mutually decided during the recording of \'\'Alarm Agents\'\' in a studio situated in a valley in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] as helicopters flew beneath the two of them. Pearce recalls:
<blockquote>"We turned toward each other and said, \'This is going to be the last collaboration. It can\'t get better than this.\'"<ref name=WSDDEMISE/></blockquote>

In 2013, in order to dismiss all speculation and questions about future collaborations between Pearce and Rice, Rice announced via Facebook that he had severed personal and business relationships with Pearce.

====Collaboration with Miro Snejdr====

In April 2009, users of the Death in June Yahoo Group pointed the YouTube videos from pianist Miro Snejdr doing covers of classic Death in June titles.

<blockquote>"I watched the videos Miro had posted on YouTube of instrumental songs from Death In June\xe2\x80\x99s The Rule Of Thirds album and was very impressed. Courtesy of these members of the DIJ group we were put in contact with each other."<ref name="MIROSNEJDR">[http://theendofbeing.com/2010/11/23/death-in-june-interview-with-douglas-p-and-miro-snejdr/ Interview with Douglas P. and Miro Snejdr.]</ref></blockquote>

Consequently, the piano-based album [[Peaceful Snow/Lounge Corps|Peaceful Snow]] was released in November 2010, with rearrangements by [[Miro Snejdr]] of Douglas P.\'s guitar-based demo recordings. Those original recordings were later released on the album [[The Snow Bunker Tapes]] in 2013.

Since 2012, Miro Snejdr is also performing live with Death in June, either on piano or accordion.

==Influences and Aesthetics==

{{Empty section|date=February 2015}}

===Influences===
Film and certain television programs have been a major influence on Death in June, sometimes being worked into compositions or referenced directly in album titles. Influential films and television shows include \'\'[[The World That Summer]]\'\', \'\'[[Take a Closer Look]]\'\', \'\'[[The Night Porter]]\'\', \'\'[[The Prisoner]]\'\', \'\'[[Night and Fog (film)|Night and Fog]]\'\', and \'\'[[Come and See]]\'\'.

Pearce has cited [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], the Norse \'\'[[Eddas]]\'\', [[Yukio Mishima]], Saxon poetry, and [[Jean Genet]] as strong influences upon his work. Although some of these influences have waned as the discography has increased, Genet and Mishima were quoted in the booklet of the rare track retrospective \'\'Abandon Tracks\'\' (2001).

Pearce has stated that [[Nico]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Ennio Morricone]], [[Industrial Records]]-era [[Industrial music]], \'\'Forever Changes\'\'-era Love and traditional European folk music have all had a considerable impact upon his musical output.

===Neofolk music===
{{main|Neofolk}}
Pearce\'s influence was also instrumental in creating a genre of music called neofolk throughout Europe. Pearce often plays live with artists that are considered a part of this genre and guests on their records.

===Masks===
According to Pearce, since its inception Death in June:<blockquote>"[We] did not want to become a part of a normal rock \'n\' roll thing. Pretty boys staring into the cameras with huge cocks and IQs of one million... It doesn\'t work like that."<ref name=EDGEOFTIME>[http://www.deathinjune.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Interview:2002-Edge_of_time 2002 \'\'Edge of Time\'\' interview] with Douglas Pearce</ref></blockquote>

===Camouflage===
Specific varieties of [[camouflage]] are regularly worn by Pearce and appear on various Death in June releases. Most commonly, the variety of camouflage used is the German World War II Waffen SS autumnal [[Erbsenmuster]]/"pea pattern"<ref>{{cite web|title=SS- Erbsenmuster, Greater German Reich|url=http://www.kamouflage.net/camouflage/00117.php|work=kamouflage.net|publisher=Brad Turner|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> (usually on original items) though sometimes the modern [[Bundeswehr]] [[Flecktarn]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bundeswehr Flecktarn|url=http://www.kamouflage.net/camouflage/00009.php|work=kamouflage.net|publisher=Brad Turner|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> or possibly the post-[[World War II]] [[Austria]]n [[fleckerlteppich]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Fleckerlteppich|url=http://www.kamouflage.net/camouflage/00008.php|work=kamouflage.net|publisher=Brad Turner|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> pattern is used.

The subject of camouflage has also appeared in the lyrics of Death in June, notably in the song "Hidden Among the Leaves", a reference to the [[Japan]]ese [[Hagakure]].

[[Image:Totenkopf6.jpg|175px|thumb|right|The Totenkopf-6.]]

===Totenkopf-6===
A slightly grinning skull, framed by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. Death in June has, since at least the \'\'State Laughter / Holy Water\'\' 7\xe2\x80\xb3, used variations of the Prussian [[Totenkopf]] or "Death\'s Head" symbol.  Pearce has stated repeatedly that the symbol is not an endorsement of [[extermination camp]] atrocities and the symbol far predates the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], having been used by the [[Prussia]]n army under [[Frederick the Great]]. Although the particular version used by Death in June is a modified, faintly grinning version of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] insignia, Pearce has stated the symbolism is clear: "The Totenkopf for Death, and the six for the sixth month - June." <ref name="1996JUDASKISS">[http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php/Interview:1996-Judas_Kiss interview with Douglas Pearce for \'\'Judas Kiss\'\' zine]</ref>

[[Image:Whiphand.jpg|175px|thumb|left|The Whip-Hand.]]

===Whip-Hand===
A studded, gloved hand holding a whip surrounded by a circle and a small 6 in the lower right corner. This symbol has been used by Death in June since at least the \'\'[[She Said Destroy]]\'\' 7\xe2\x80\xb3/12\xe2\x80\xb3, stated by Pearce to signify control and relates to \'\'having the whip hand\'\', a British expression.<ref name="1996JUDASKISS">[http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php/Interview:1996-Judas_Kiss/Interview:1996-Judas_Kiss1996 interview with Douglas Pearce for \'\'Judas Kiss\'\' zine]</ref> The hand is gloved, giving it both a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] element, and is often used either in place of the Totenkopf or with it. This symbol was used later than the Totenkopf and is usually secondary to it. As with the Totenkopf-6, the 6 presumably refers to June.

===Three Bars===
Three parallel, up-standing vertical bars accompanied by a small six in the lower right corner. Although a very basic symbol, this symbol likely originates, for the use of Death in June, from the 1943 Kursk version of the insignia of the [[3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf]]. This symbol was used as vehicle markings on the vehicles of that unit. It may have been used to signify the three members of Death in June at the time. Scantly used afterwards for the purpose of Death in June, it first appeared on the \'\'[[Lesson One: Misanthropy!]]\'\' LP and is rarely used when not referring directly to this period of Death in June.

===Runes===

In a 2005 interview, Pearce states:<blockquote>"I\'m very happy about that because I see Death in June as part of a European cultural revival. I\'m pleased that the Old Gods are being resurrected, for want of a better word. Old symbols. I feel very pleased that I am a part of that process and that I have had influence. At this stage in the game, so to speak, it\'s not false modesty to say that I am content with my influence."<ref name="WSDDEMISE"/></blockquote>

According to Pearce:<blockquote>"In 1986 whilst staying with Tibet in his flat in [[Freya Aswynn]]\'s house in north London over a period of 3 nights I dreamed I was falling in a sort of rain of indistinct runes. On each separate night I managed to concentrate enough on one particular rune to stop it from spinning and moving so I could actually see which one it was. When I awoke I made a note of it. After 3 nights the dream stopped and I decided to try and form an \'appropriate\' bind rune from the original 3. This I did and after Freya saw it I basically was given a \'thumbs up\' about the whole thing. It definitely does not refer to my name but it definitely does refer to ME."<ref name=Bindrune>[http://www.deathinjune.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Interview:2002-Yahoo_Groups_1 Response to question asked by fan in 2002, on the official Death in June Yahoo group]</ref></blockquote>

The [[Odal rune]] has sometimes been used by Pearce. This can be seen very visibly on the \'\'Come Before Christ and Murder Love\'\' 7\xe2\x80\xb3 cover. The [[Algiz|algiz rune]] has often been used by Pearce for non-album Death in June purposes, appearing sometimes with a circle around it as seen on \'\'The World That Summer\'\' 2\xc3\x97LP, on the official website and elsewhere.

==Controversy==
Detractors have accused Death in June of harboring [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] sympathies. Pearce has said, "At the start of the eighties, Tony and I were involved in radical left politics and beneath it history students. In search of a political view for the future we came across [[National Bolshevism]] which is closely connected with the \'\'[[Sturmabteilung]]\'\' hierarchy. People like [[Gregor Strasser]] and [[Ernst R\xc3\xb6hm]] who were later known as \'second revolutionaries\' attracted our attention."<ref>\'\'Misery and Purity: A History and Personal Interpretation of Death in June\'\' by Robert Forbes (Jara Press, Amersham 1995) p15</ref> The \'\'Sturmabteilung\'\' ([[Sturmabteilung|Stormtroopers]]) were a paramilitary unit of the [[Nazi Party]] ([[NSDAP]]), and Strasser and R\xc3\xb6hm were Nazi leaders who vied for [[Adolf Hitler]]\'s power.

Protests have been staged and some performances have been cancelled due to these accusations.<ref name="DEROGATAS2003">DeRogatas, Jim. [http://www.jimdero.com/News2003/BottleDec17.htm "Nazis or not? Censorship keeps fans from deciding"], Chicago Sun-Times, December 17, 2003.</ref> Justification for the cancellations stem from strong aversions to the Nazi inspired symbolism of Death in June coupled with an interpretation of select lyrics as containing deliberate [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]-era imagery and tropes. When questioned about his interest in the Third Reich, Pearce responded, "I\'ve an interest in all aspects of the Third Reich. It has had such a huge influence on the world, who could fail to be intrigued by it? However, I\'ve still read more pages of \'\'[[Das Kapital]]\'\' than \'\'[[Mein Kampf]]\'\'!"<ref name=ACHTUNGBABY>[http://www.deathinjune.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Interview:1999-Achtung_Baby 1999 interview with Douglas Pearce by Russian webzine \'\'Achtung Baby\'\']</ref>

Pearce, who is openly [[homosexuality|homosexual]], has collaborated with various ethnic [[Jew]]s throughout his music career{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. The official Death in June website site featured the [[flag of Israel]], and Death in June played a concert in [[Israel]] on June 18, 2004 for a predominantly Jewish audience.

===Banned in Lausanne, Switzerland===
On 19 November 1998, Death in June was scheduled to play with [[Boyd Rice]], Fire + Ice, and [[Der Blutharsch]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. A day prior the scheduled show, Pearce appeared wearing a sign, restrained by two men (Boyd Rice and Albin Julius) in ape suits wearing [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]-era [[swastika]] arm bands. He gave a press conference announcing that he had been banned for the first time from playing live. After pressure from a local activist group, the decision was made by the local chief of police [[Bernard Metraux]], due to perceived ambiguity, to not allow Pearce to appear on stage. However, Rice, Fire + Ice and Der Blutharsch were allowed to take the stage.

A [[petition]] for the resignation of Metraux circulated amongst concertgoers at the show and eventually equaled 184 signatures.<ref>[http://www.sanctuary.ch/report/DeathInJune/Petition.htm Online copy of the petition]</ref> At the concert, a man appearing to be Pearce took the stage and revealed himself to be Rice. Rice performed an altered rendition of Death in June\'s "C\'est un r\xc3\xaave" to commemorate the event. This rendition of the song was later credited to "NON & Freunde", and was released on the \'\'[[Der tod im juni]]\'\' compilation. After the concert, a website was created by Swiss fans featuring photographs recording the event.<ref>[http://www.sanctuary.ch/report/DeathInJune]</ref> Pearce later recorded a song about the situation on \'\'Operation Hummingbird\'\' in 1998.

In a 2005 interview with Pearce, he recalls the event:<blockquote>\'\'This has to do with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they\'ve heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don\'t care about old women gossiping. If at the end of the day, it means I don\'t play, good, I don\'t want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.\'\'</blockquote>

<blockquote>\'\'When I had a meeting with the Council a day before the concert, they were absolutely petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say \'I am not going to destroy you\' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.\'\'\'</blockquote>

<blockquote>\'\'Of course, there were no Nazi, skinhead hordes and I didn\'t play and they got elected. So, life goes on. The fishwives got their way.\'\'<ref name=GOTHICINFO2001>2001 \'\'Gothic Info\'\' webzine interview with Douglas Pearce. Viewable online here:[http://www.deathinjune.org/modules/mediawiki/index.php/Interview:2001-GothicInfo]</ref></blockquote>

===Cancelled performance in Chicago, Illinois===
The concert was scheduled to take place at a venue called [[The Empty Bottle]] on 13 December 2003, with Der Blutharsch and [[Changes (band)|Changes]]. Initially, pressure from a group calling themselves the Center for New Community was applied to the owner of the club, Bruce Finkelman. Finkelman, who is Jewish, and his staff, which contains [[African American]]s, initially decided the show would go on, feeling there was insufficient evidence to cancel the performance.<ref name="DEROGATAS2003" />

Debate continued on The Empty Bottle\'s website, fueled partially by an email and ten-day telephone campaign waged by the Center for New Community to ban the event. Finkelman offered a compromise: He invited the CNC to distribute anti-racist information within the venue, as well as any other group that wished to do so, and offered to give the venue\'s proceeds of the concert to the [[Anti-Defamation League]]. The CNC refused.<ref name="DEROGATAS2003" />

Finkelman, feeling the pressure, started to relent and decided to remove Changes from the bill. As the controversy mounted from complaints regarding the band due to the Center for New Community\'s campaign, he eventually cancelled the night altogether. Due to the mounting pressure and threats of violence by other groups, Finkelman expressed regret for this decision, describing the censorship as a "black mark on the arts community" and continued to encourage open discussion instead of censorship.<ref name="DEROGATAS2003" />

The venue was moved to Deja Vu, another venue in Chicago that Saturday. Members of [[Anti-Racist Action]] began to gather at the venue. The concert was cancelled by the venue owners just before it was scheduled to begin, due to violence between Anti-Racist Action and fans of Death in June.<ref name="DEROGATAS2003" /><ref name="ARALETTER">Anti-Racist Action released a statement condemning the band on their website [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=03/12/17/8467619 here], and after the show [http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=03/12/16/7922038&query=death%2Bin%2Bjune here], which resulted in a critical response of Anti-Racist Action by a self-described African American fan [http://chicago.indymedia.org/newswire/display/34629/index.php here]</ref>

===Federal restrictions in Germany===
On 21 December 2005, the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons]] banned all sales and distribution of \'\'Rose Clouds of Holocaust\'\' to minors, which had been available to everyone in the country since 1995. Early in 2006, discussion on the Death in June Yahoo list resulted in a response from Pearce, who revealed that he had been asked several months earlier by his distributor, Tesco Organisation Germany (based in [[Mannheim]]), to explain passages of his work to the German government.<ref name="Statement by Douglas P concerning the \'indexing\' of Rose Clouds Of Holocaust in Germany part 1">[http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php/Article:Statement1 Death in June France news page]</ref><ref name="Statement by Douglas P concerning the \'indexing\' of Rose Clouds Of Holocaust in Germany part 2">[http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php/Article:Statement2 Death in June France news page]</ref><ref name="Statement by Douglas P concerning the \'indexing\' of Rose Clouds Of Holocaust in Germany part 3">[http://www.deathinjune.org/wiki/index.php/Article:Statement3 Death in June France news page]</ref> Pearce provided his original response to the government, which featured, for the first time, Pearce\'s explanation for numerous aspects of Death in June, including lyrics, song titles, events and use of aesthetics as well as dates, people and locations. Pearce issued a second letter stating that Tesco Organisation Germany had filed an appeal against the ban. At the request of Douglas P., who viewed it as a demeaning waste of time and money, the appeal was abandoned in November 2007.

A third email was sent regarding the ban, in which Pearce expressed concern for further arbitrary action by the German authorities in banning further albums and artists within the "Neo-Folk/Post Industrial/whatever you wish to label it scene." Pearce requested the organisation of a "Fighting Fund Festival" to help raise funds for legal support.<ref>Pearce made this request via a fan-run discussion group [http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/deathinjune/message/28176 here].</ref>

Meanwhile \'\'Brown Book\'\' has been banned as well, and selling it is totally illegal in Germany because it contains elements of the song "[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]", which was the official anthem of the Brown shirted S.A.(Sturmabteilung). This happened according to [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a]], which outlaws "use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations".

\'\'\'Die Form\'\'\' is a French [[industrial music|post-industrial]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] band formed in 1977-78. The name \'Die Form\' means \'(the) form/shape\' in [[German language|German]], like the [[Bauhaus]] diary and is a play on the English homonym \'deformed\' and on the French homonym \'difforme\' (deformed).

== Biography ==
Die Form is the primary project of the French electronic musician and multimedia artist Philippe Fichot. He began by recording a number of experimental cassette releases in the late 1970s, with the first Die Form vinyl release (\'Die Puppe\') appearing in 1982. Whilst the project was still in its infancy, the underlying concepts were still evident - a combination of esoteric electronic experiments with an underlying theme of erotism, death and other \'taboo\' subjects, apparent in both the music and the album artwork, which Philippe also produces. Other early projects of Philippe Fichot included Krylon Hertz, Mental Code, Camera Obscura, Eva-Johanna Reichstag, Hurt and Fine Automatic.

\'Some Experiences With Shock\' followed in 1984, with the project taking a direction towards a more commercial sound on 1986\'s \'Poup\xc3\xa9e M\xc3\xa9canique\'. The project then consolidated its experimental and melodic sides on \'Photogrammes\', before introducing vocalist (and model) Eliane P. on the 1991 album \'Corpus Delicti\', who remains with the project to this day. The next release, 1992\'s \'Confessions\' saw a club hit in \'Silent Order\', with sister album \'Ad Infinitum\' (which originated from the same recording sessions) released a year later.

The next \'Die Form\' releases saw the poetic, emotional side of their sound richen via \'The Trilogy of Passions\', starting with \'Suspiria De Profundis\' in 1994, followed by \'L\'\xc3\xa2me \xc3\xa9lectrique\' the following year. 1997\'s \'Duality\' does not complete the trilogy, Phillipe Fichot choosing to leave the project open-ended. The \'Histories\' compilation discs appeared in 1998, with the next album \'Extremum/XX\' appearing in 2000. Then followed the \'diptych\' of \'InHuman\' (2004) and \'ExHuman\' (2006), continuing their release of interrelated concept albums.

"The Bach project"<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26529_0_2_0_C Die Form goes Bach with \'The Bach project\']</ref> was released in January 2008, an album obviously devoted to Bach. Die Form first presented this work live during the annual Bach Days in the German city of Leipzig, where they got invited.  Die Form has created a new show for this project with the German dancer Sabine Seume.

Die Form left [[Trisol Music Group|Trisol]] to join [[Out of Line]] in late 2008. A new single, "Her[t]z Frequenz", was released in October 2008, followed by the "Best of XXX" in November 2008 (a compilation with reworked and remastered songs from the past 30 years).

In 2009, "Noir Magn\xc3\xa9tique" saw Die Form back in a club-oriented sound. The album was made available on CD only, with a special edition limited to 999 copies in a box with a 7" single and extra artwork. Die Form created a new show with Laina Fischbeck on stage.

In March 2010, a vinyl boxset compilation of early K-Cassette material was released on Vinyl-On-Demand.

In 2011, a double-CD digipak limited edition of Sombre Printemps ("Ambient & Film Music 1+2") has been released on Out Of Line.

\'\'\'Die Warzau\'\'\' (originally \'\'\'Die Warzau Synfony\'\'\') was an [[industrial music]] band formed in 1987 by performance artists [[Jim Marcus]] and [[Van Christie]].

==History==
Originally signed to Chris Parry\'s [[Fiction Records]], the group released \'\'Disco Rigido\'\' in the late 1980s.

A second album, \'\'Big Electric Metal Bass Face\'\', was released in the early 1990s.  Contributors to the band at the time included [[Chris Vrenna]] and [[James Woolley]] (both members of [[Nine Inch Nails]] during the mid-1990s), and audio visual artist Burle Avant, who went on to co-create the MTV television series [[Amp (TV series)|Amp]].

\'\'Engine\'\', a 1995 release on [[Wax Trax]]/[[TVT Records|TVT]], was the last album the group released before going on hiatus for almost a decade, and included contributions from [[Chris Randall (musician)|Chris Randall]] of the band [[Sister Machine Gun]] (SMG).  One of the songs written by Die Warzau during this time, "Hole In the Ground," ended up on the SMG album [[Burn (Sister Machine Gun album)|Burn]].

Die Warzau as a group then went on hiatus for a number of years, with Marcus and Christie working on other projects. Jim Marcus founded the pure funk group Everplastic while Van Christie worked on another project called Eco-Hed.

In 2004, the duo re-united, together with new members Abel Garibaldi and Dan Evans, releasing \'\'Convenience\'\' on their Chicago-based label Pulseblack Records.

2008 saw the release of \'\'Vinyl 88\'\', a collection of remixes and previously unreleased tracks including "Born Again" (for which a video was released) and "Hitler\'s Brain", a collaboration with funk pioneer [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]].  While some of the tracks had seen prior release, many of the remixes featured re-recorded elements.

In 2009, Die Warzau made several songs \xe2\x80\x93 many from the recent \'\'Convenience\'\' and \'\'Vinyl 88\'\' releases \xe2\x80\x93 available for remixing at [http://www.remixgalaxy.com RemixGalaxy.com] The different musical elements (vocals, drums, bass, etc.) of each song are available as separate tracks, which allows users the opportunity to create their own versions of the songs or incorporate the parts into their own original tracks under personal, non-commercial license.

In 2011, Die Warzau announced on their Facebook page that their performance at the WTII Minifest 2 on June 12 would be the band\'s last performance before breaking up.  The live personnel included Jim Marcus, Dan Evans, Vince McAley, and Jay Ramirez.

In 2013, the band announced that they will reunite to play one show at the "Cold Waves II" festival held in Chicago in late September 2013.

\'\'\'Download\'\'\' is a [[Canadian]] electronic music group formed by [[Dwayne Goettel]] and [[cEvin Key]] of [[Skinny Puppy]] in 1994. The initial lineup also included Off & Gone\'s [[Phil Western]] and [[Mark Spybey]] of [[Dead Voices on Air]], but has since been particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members following [[Dwayne Goettel|Goettel]]\'s death.  Download\'s music has been described as [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]], drawing from the band\'s genesis as part of [[Skinny Puppy]] but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Autechre]].  The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of [[synthesizer]]s and [[Sampling (music)|sample]]d [[musical instrument|instrument]]s; the music is particularly centered on elements of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[rhythm]].

Other artists that have been involved are [[Genesis P. Orridge]], Anthony Valcic, Bill Van Rooy, and Ken Marshall. Earlier releases frequently included [[vocal]] elements and [[lyrics]], but since [[III (Download album)|III]] (and Mark Spybey\'s departure in 1996) their work has been strictly instrumental.

== History ==

=== \'\'Furnace\'\' and \'\'Microscopic\'\' ===
In the first era of Download\'s career, the band\'s sound was an Experimental Industrial style which featured vocals by Mark Spybey and guest vocals by Genesis P. Orridge.  Their first LP, \'\'[[Furnace (Download album)|Furnace]]\'\', was arguably their least accessible&mdash;most of the tracks lasted for over four minutes, some lasting as long as nine minutes. Their next release, the \'\'[[Microscopic (EP)|Microscopic EP]]\'\' continued this style.  It featured three remixes of tracks from \'\'Furnace\'\' (only one of which was remixed by the band itself, the other two were remixed by [[Biosphere (musician)|Biosphere]] and [[Newt (band)|Newt]]), along with five original tracks.

=== \'\'Charlie\'s Family\'\' ===
\'\'[[Charlie\'s Family]]\'\' was another experimental industrial LP by Download, except this LP was a soundtrack to the movie of the same name, and it had significantly different sound than the previous two releases.  Instead of the beat-oriented music that dominated \'\'Furnace\'\' and \'\'Microscopic\'\', this LP\'s music was mostly dominated by a simple beat along with many samples of anything from women [[orgasm]]ing to [[airplane]]s taking off.

=== \'\'The Eyes of Stanley Pain\'\' and \'\'Sidewinder\'\' ===
What could be considered Download\'s third era to one fan could be considered a revisit to their first style by the next. \'\'[[The Eyes of Stanley Pain]]\'\' is arguably Download\'s most diverse-sounding and accessible industrial album. It spanned 14 tracks, most of which were about four or five minutes long.  The only exceptions were the tracks "Glassblower" and "Collision", which were 3:02 and 10:38, respectively. Later that year, the [[Extended play|EP]] \'\'[[Sidewinder (EP)|Sidewinder]]\'\' was released by the band. In the same vein as their first EP--\'\'Microscopic\'\'\xe2\x80\x94it contained eight tracks, except four were remixes.  Three were remixes by Download of songs from \'\'The Eyes of Stanley Pain\'\', and one was a remix of the song "Attalal" from \'\'Furnace\'\' by the band [[Haujobb]] (although the packaging of Sidewinder spells it "Attallal"). The other four songs were original songs recorded by Download, and the last of Download\'s [[Post-industrial music|post-industrial]] era.

=== \'\'III\'\' and \'\'Effector\'\' ===
\'\'[[III (Download album)|III]]\'\' marked a turning point for Download.  Their sound became more melodic and accessible while still retaining the experimental quirks of their older material.  Their next album \'\'[[Effector (album)|Effector]]\'\' continued this direction.

=== \'\'III Steps Forward\'\' and \'\'Inception ===
Two more albums, \'\'[[III Steps Forward]]\'\' and \'\'[[Inception (Download album)|Inception]]\'\' were released as part of Subconscious Studio\'s From The Vault series. \'\'Inception\'\' contained outtakes from Download\'s more experimental early era, while \'\'[[III Steps Forward]]\'\' included outtakes from the III and Effector eras as well as new tracks.  Although the original pressing of each was limited to 1000 copies, 2nd pressing editions are currently available from Subconscious Studio\'s website.

=== \'\'Fixer\'\' ===
In December 2006, cEvin Key announced that new material has been recorded for a new album (entitled \'\'[[Fixer (album)|Fixer]]\'\'). The album was released on April 2007.

===HElicopTEr & Wookie Wall===
In late 2009, Subconscious Communications announced the release of the "Beyond the Vault" series.  With it, a new Download album titled [[HELicopTer|HElicopTEr]] was included in the series.  Written by cEvin Key and Phil Western with a guest appearance by Mark Spybey.  As stated on the official Subconscious Communications website, the album employs some of the oldest synthesizers the studio has in its sprawling collection.  The result differs from the more ambient releases of Effector and Fixer and is more akin to Download\'s previous works such as Furnace or Charlie\'s Family.  The album is available as part of the Beyond the Vault series or individually via the subconscious Communications website and as of February 2010 a digital download has become available through Amazon.com.  The album has not yet been released through the iTunes Store.

\'\'Wookie Wall\'\': For the 2010 "SubCon Beyond Fest", a tour in support of the albums released in the Beyond The Vault series, Download announced plans to release an EP that would be sold during the tour. Though Download apparently went as far as to commission album art,[5] the so-called Wookie Wall EP never materialized during the tour though the title track was integrated into the setlist. Supposedly the band considered the possibility of expanding Wookie Wall into its own full-length album, but in 2011 three of the proposed Wookie Wall tracks were added onto a re-release of Download\'s Helicopter.

A special-edition of \'\'Furnace\'\' was also released with Subconscious\' From the Vault II series. The new release includes a second disc with a collection of the live jams and improvisations that were the basis of the finished album.

===LingAM===
On June 11, 2013, Download released their ninth studio album Lingam. In Hindu scripture, the lingam is the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.  Lingam employs some of the band\'s more ambient styles featured on previous albums like Effector and Fixer.

\'\'\'Eve of Destiny\'\'\' is a [[Japan]]ese [[industrial rock]] band founded in 1999 by Haruhiko Ash (formerly of [[punk rock]] / [[hard rock]] band [[The Zolge]]). For a long time, Eve of Destiny was a solo project of Ash, with not much real activity, but this changed in 2002, after guitarist [[K\xc3\xb6zi]] of [[Malice Mizer]] fame joined and they started to tour outside Japan on a regular basis. The group has performed in Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, The Philippines, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Japan, France, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Poland.

==Members==
===Haruhiko Ash===
Prior to Eve of Destiny, Haruhiko Ash founded the Japanese hard rock band [[The Zolge]] and the Tokyo club Eve the New Church, a place to promote gothic music and the Japanese underground music scene. Ash was a close friend of [[Lords of the New Church]] vocalist [[Stiv Bators]] and his wife Caroline.

The Zolge was a quite well known band in Japan\'s underground music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. Upon playing some concerts abroad he made several acquaintances with bands and people. These include [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Patricia Morrison]], [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[The Cramps]], [[Ramones]], [[Johnny Thunders]], [[Switchblade Symphony]] and others.

The Zolge disbanded in 1993, but Haruhiko Ash stayed active in various fields such as writing and fashion modeling in both Paris and Tokyo. Later, in 1998, the song "Desperado" was released in the Black Bible compilation from US label [[Cleopatra Records]]. This was Eve of Destiny\'s first recorded song.

===K\xc3\xb6zi===
[[K\xc3\xb6zi]] is the former guitarist of the popular Japanese [[visual kei]] band [[Malice Mizer]]. After they went on hiatus at the end of 2001, K\xc3\xb6zi joined Haruhiko Ash, whom he knew from times before Malice Mizer, and together they reformed the Eve of Destiny project. Later, K\xc3\xb6zi started a solo career, releasing several singles and albums.

== History ==
Shortly after the release of the Black Bible compilation, Eve of Destiny was invited to play at the [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in Leipzig, Germany in 1999, where Haruhiko appeared together with several guest musicians. After this, years of silence followed. However around the time Malice Mizer disbanded Eve of Destiny was invited again, so in 2002 Haruhiko returned, now together with K\xc3\xb6zi (before this they only played two gigs at the Philippines). The concert was quite a success and they were also invited to New Zealand and Switzerland later that year. In 2003 they started to tour Europe regularly and played at several countries for then on, both at festivals and clubs. The band played its first concert in Japan in February, 2004 and it was followed by two more next year, but Europe remained their main target. They had some tracks in compilation CDs, appeared in a few gothic magazines and were looking for a record company. They finally signed to the German Celtic Circle Production label, but unfortunately this turned out to be a bad choice. After postponing it for countless times the label finally released their debut mini-album called \'Nervous And Innocence\' in 2005, but scandals followed, including the last-minute cancellation of a festival organized by the label and the CD was basically impossible to get. Soon afterwards even the label\'s website disappeared and the band decided to cancel their contract with them. Eve of Destiny played a few more gigs in Autumn, 2005, but after this even their website was not updated any more and it finally disappeared in 2006. K\xc3\xb6zi continued his solo career, but there is no news about Haruhiko Ash or about any future activity for Eve of Destiny.

Around September, 2007, a new website for the band and Haruhiko\'s company, Evil Boy Productions showed up, hinting at some kind of activity, but just a few months later, it disappeared without a trace.

\'\'\'Faderhead\'\'\' is a [[Germany|German]] [[electronic music]] producer from [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. His music is usually described as [[Electronic body music|EBM]], [[Synthpop]] or [[Futurepop]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History==
After releasing the track "The Protagonist" as a one-off compilation entry on the Advanced Electronics Vol. 3, Faderhead received a deal with Accession Records/Indigo to release his debut album FH1 in 2006. Positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/reviews_comments.php?id=15922_0_17_0_C |title=Faderhead - FH1 (cd Accession Records) - review, free links at SIDE-LINE |publisher=Side-line.com |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref><ref>[http://www.musicnonstop.co.uk/product-view.php?productid=11668] {{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> made FH1 an instant debut-success with standout tracks like "The Protagonist", "Vanish" and "O/H Scavenger". The year progressed and saw Faderhead play shows alongside bands like [[Diary Of Dreams]], [[SITD]], Painbastard and others.<ref>[http://www.diaryofdreams.de/index2.php?section=dod01&lg=en&dod_news=old&Seite=4&Total=63 ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contribe.de/eng_index.shtml |title={ Contribe &#124; Booking & Promotion } |publisher=Contribe.de |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>

2007 saw the release of the FH2 CD which featured the club hit "Dirtygrrrls/Dirtybois". Faderhead released a music video for the track "Girly Show" and played festivals like [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] ([[Germany]]) and [[Infest (festival)|Infest]] ([[UK]]) among other shows.

2008 started with the departure from Accession Records and the signing to L-Tracks Recordings. This decision led to serious speculation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=32491_0_2_0_C |title=Faderhead disillusioned by dark scene - calls it quits - Faderhead news at |publisher=Side-line.com |date=2013-11-27 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> regarding the future of Faderhead by press and fans, but the free song/video release of the [[piano ballad]] "Exit Ghost" revealed that the project would continue. Only a few months later the [[club anthem]] "TZDV" was released, and on October 10, the FH3 album was released and again gathered top reviews.<ref>[http://electrogothic.blogspot.com/2008/08/faderhead-fh3.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3785&Itemid=44 ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gothtronic.com/?page=23&reviews=6290 |title=\xd0\x9f\xd1\x83\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb2\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe \xd0\xbc\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd1\x83 \xd1\x88\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb0 \xe2\x80\x93 \xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb4\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8, \xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x81\xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb6\xd0\xb8, \xd0\xb0\xd0\xba\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb8 - \xd0\x92 \xd0\xbc\xd0\xb8\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbc\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb4\xd0\xbd\xd1\x8b\xd1\x85 \xd0\xb1\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb4\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2 23 |publisher=Gothtronic.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref>

In 2009, Faderhead played the [[M\'era Luna Festival]] (Germany), the [[Exit Festival]] ([[Serbia]]) as well as shows in the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Great Britain]], [[Belgium]] and [[Mexico]]. In October 2009, Faderhead released the "Horizon Born" EP, which was well received.<ref>[http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6077&Itemid=44 ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> 

2010 saw the release of \'\'Trilogy\'\'. Since FH1, FH2 and FH3 had been sold out and were not reprinted, Faderhead decided to compile the most popular 18 tracks from that release onto one CD.

In October 2010, the fourth full-length album, \'\'Black Friday\'\', was released. The concept album tells the story of a night gone wrong. It was accompanied by a 15-minute short movie and quickly garnered reviews as Faderhead\xe2\x80\x99s most mature album.<ref>[http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8388&Itemid=44 ]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> Faderhead played a European club tour as well as the Christmas Ball Festival tour with Laibach, Project Pitchfork, Fields Of The Nephilim and Agonoize.<ref>[https://www.madgoth.de/4990/news/the-christmas-ball-festival-2010-and-one-headliner-in-hannover] {{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref>

2011 began with a 15-show tour in the USA with Aesthetic Perfection and Everything Goes Cold <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3uPnV_CQm0&list=PLx-21m_BTt0X0oUzr4oPyPC3cwX0RlZgf&index=5 |title=Faderhead - US Tour 2011 (Day 1 - Travel) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> and ended with a download-only EP release called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way To Fuck Clubs\xe2\x80\x9d, which showcased remixes of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way To Fuck God\xe2\x80\x9d as well as an acoustic version of \xe2\x80\x9cHot Bath And A Cold Razor\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moth And The Fire\xe2\x80\x9d. The biggest show of 2011 happened at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in Leipzig when the festival organizers had to close the venue to prevent overcrowding.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SHaFpcriPA&list=PLx-21m_BTt0X0oUzr4oPyPC3cwX0RlZgf&index=4 |title=Faderhead - 2011 Summer Festival Recap (Behind The Scenes) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> 

In 2012, the fifth album, \'\'The World Of Faderhead\'\', was released alongside [http://www.theworldoffaderhead.com/?p=visuals three 360\xc2\xb0 panoramic images] and 3 music videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldoffaderhead.com |title=Faderhead - New Album!

Faderhead headlined a 14-show US tour and played all over Europe including a set at the [[M\'era Luna Festival]] hangar stage. The European pressing of \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Of Faderhead\xe2\x80\x9d was already almost sold out before the end of the year and Faderhead reached the no. 7 spot of MusicNonStop\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling releases of 2012 in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faderhead.com/blog/musicnonstop-top-sellers-2012/ |title=MusicNonStop Top Sellers 2012 \xe2\x80\x94 |publisher=Faderhead.com |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> tying And One and coming in ahead of legacy-acts like Fields Of The Nephilim, De/Vision, Suicide Commando and Hocico. Because "The World Of Faderhead" sold out so quickly, Faderhead also released the double-CD-compilation "Two Sides To Every Story"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stormingthebase.com/faderhead-two-sides-to-every-story-2cd/ |title=Faderhead. Two Sides To Every Story. 2CD. |publisher=Storming the Base |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}</ref> which features Faderhead\'s most popular clubtracks on CD 1 and the most popular pop-songs/ballads on CD 2.

Faderhead\'s live shows are currently supported by either Marco Visconti (XP8), J\xc3\xb6rg L\xc3\xbctkemeier (Straftanz) or Daniel and Joe Meyer (Project SAM) on keyboards and backing vocals. The Hamburg producer/vocalist uses different musicians for live performances and so far has played with Alex Montana (drums/percussion) and Christine LaGivr\xc3\xa9e, Dr. T, Shaolyn, Chandler XL, Judith Dorn and Shawn Mierez.

}}
\'\'\'Filter\'\'\' is an American [[industrial rock]] group formed in 1993 in [[Cleveland]] by singer [[Richard Patrick]] and guitarist/programmer [[Brian Liesegang]]. The band was formed after Patrick desired to start his own band after leaving [[Nine Inch Nails]] as their touring guitarist. Their debut album, \'\'[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]\'\', was released in 1995, and ended up going platinum, selling over one million copies, largely due to the success of the band\'s single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]." After the album, the band would go through the first of many line-up changes, leaving Patrick as the only consistent member across all music releases.

Patrick released the band\'s follow up album, \'\'[[Title of Record]]\'\', which also went platinum, off the success of the song "[[Take a Picture]]", in 1999, and a third album, \'\'[[The Amalgamut]]\'\', in 2002, before checking into rehab after years of heavy [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]]. The band went into hiatus while Patrick went to rehab, and then formed a new band, [[Army of Anyone]], which released [[Army of Anyone (album)|one self-title album]]. Filter reformed in 2008 to release \'\'[[Anthems for the Damned]]\'\', and then \'\'[[The Trouble with Angels (album)|The Trouble with Angels]]\'\' in 2010, with Patrick and a revolving door of other musicians. Filter\'s sixth and most recent studio album, \'\'[[The Sun Comes Out Tonight]]\'\', was released in 2013. In August 2014, Patrick stated he plans to release a seventh studio album in 2015.

==History==

===\'\'Short Bus\'\' (1994\xe2\x80\x931998)===
[[Richard Patrick]] played guitar with Nine Inch Nails during the [[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series|touring for \'\'Pretty Hate Machine\'\']] and in the music videos for [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|\'\'Broken\'\']]; he left the band while [[Trent Reznor]] was recording \'\'[[The Downward Spiral]]\'\' and began a new recording project with Brian Liesegang.  Dubbing themselves Filter, they signed to [[Reprise Records]] in 1994 and recorded their first album, \'\'[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]\'\', which was released in the following year. The album was commercially successful, and included the hit single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]". This song was somewhat controversial, as it was seen as capitalizing on the public suicide of [[Budd Dwyer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.nyc.rr.com/alweisel/rollingstonefilter.htm|title=Hit, With a Bullet: Filter\xe2\x80\x99s "Hey Man Nice Shot"|date=July 13, 1995|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref> [[Kurt Cobain]]\'s suicide was widely rumored to have inspired the song, but the band denied this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/filter/articles/story/5925965/filter_are_back_in_the_fold|title=Rolling Stone: Filter Are Back in the Fold|date=August 24, 1999|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The first single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]" was also included in the soundtrack for the movie \'\'[[Demon Knight (soundtrack)|Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight]]\'\' in 1995 before \'\'[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]\'\' was released. In need of a live band to tour the album, Patrick and Liesegang recruited Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanagh on bass, and [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] on drums. They would all later be featured in the video for the album\'s second single, "Dose".

Between Filter\'s first and second albums, the band became known for their soundtrack contributions, The first of these tracks, "Thanks Bro", landed on the \'\'[[Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files]]\'\' album. In 1996, Filter recorded and filmed the video for the song "Jurassitol", for \'\'[[The Crow: City of Angels]]\'\' soundtrack. They also released the home video \'\'Phenomenology\'\' in 1996, which showcased some of the band\'s live performances and music videos, as well as an interview with Patrick and Liesegang filmed in [[New Mexico]].

Liesegang left in 1997 shortly after recording the Filter/[[The Crystal Method|Crystal Method]] collaboration "[[(Can\'t You) Trip Like I Do]]" for the \'\'[[Spawn (film)|Spawn]]\'\' movie soundtrack, due to creative differences with Patrick. In 1998, for \'\'[[The X-Files]]\'\' film soundtrack, Patrick decided to keep the Filter name and recorded a cover of [[Harry Nilsson]]\'s "[[One (Harry Nilsson song)|One]]".

===\'\'Title of Record\'\' (1999\xe2\x80\x932001)===
Patrick continued with 1999\'s \'\'[[Title of Record]]\'\' with returning members Lenardo and Cavanagh, as well as Steve Gillis on drums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428963/19990615/filter.jhtml|title=Filter Readying New Album, Video|date=June 15, 1999|publisher=MTV}}</ref> filling in the gap left by Walker after he left to work with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. \'\'Title of Record\'\' moved away from industrial rock somewhat, and resulted in the band\'s biggest hit, the mellow ballad "[[Take a Picture]]", along with other lesser-heard singles "Welcome to the Fold" and "The Best Things". The song "Take a Picture" is about a dispute on an aircraft, when Richard Patrick drunkenly stripped down to his boxers, alarming the other passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/f/filter/filterfeature99_2.jhtml|title=Filter: Title Of Feature|date=November 2, 1999|publisher=MTV}}</ref> The song "Captain Bligh" (after Vice-Admiral [[William Bligh]] of the [[HMS Bounty]]) was written by Patrick after leaving [[Nine Inch Nails]] and was about [[Trent Reznor]]\'s notoriously anti-social habits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} "Miss Blue" is said to have been about [[Smashing Pumpkins]] bassist [[D\'arcy Wretzky]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. She can be heard on the songs "Cancer", and "Take a Picture".

===\'\'The Amalgamut\'\' (2002)===
2002 saw the release of \'\'[[The Amalgamut]]\'\', featuring the singles "[[Where Do We Go from Here (Filter song)|Where Do We Go from Here?]]" and "American Clich\xc3\xa9". "The Only Way (Is the Wrong Way)" was also featured in the first wave of [[Hummer H2|Hummer2]] commercials that year and in the 2003 movie \'\'[[Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]\'\'. Alan Bailey was recruited for live guitar when they set off to tour the album; however, the tour ended abruptly in a matter of weeks when Richard Patrick voluntarily checked himself into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=6524|title=FILTER Frontman Checks Into Rehab, Band Cancel Tour|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> He has since tattooed his date of sobriety, September 28, 2002, on his forearm.

===Hiatus and side projects (2003\xe2\x80\x932007)===
Richard Patrick was part of the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Damning Well]], which has only released one track on the \'\'[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]\'\' movie soundtrack in 2003, despite an entire album\'s worth of recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=14503|title= FILTER Singer: \'Seriously Loud Motherfuckin\' Rock Music!\'|date=August 17, 2003|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> While nothing has directly surfaced, it is rumored that some of the material from these sessions have been an influence or has been reworked in Filter\'s 2008 release \'\'[[Anthems for the Damned]]\'\' and [[Black Light Burns]]\'s first album \'\'[[Cruel Melody]]\'\', due to the fact that [[Wes Borland]] was the guitarist of both The Damning Well and Black Light Burns.

[[Army of Anyone]], a second supergroup, side project with drummer [[Ray Luzier]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] members [[Robert DeLeo|Robert]] and [[Dean DeLeo]], released its [[Army of Anyone (album)|debut album]] on November 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62608|title= ARMY OF ANYONE\'s Debut Enters Billboard Chart At No.&nbsp;56|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> However, lack of sales of the album coupled with Richard Patrick\'s desire to do more work with Filter, led the band breaking up around mid-2007.

Former Filter members Brian Liesegang and [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] played keyboards and drums (respectively) in [[Billy Corgan]]\'s touring band in 2005 to promote his solo album. It was heavily rumored that Geno Lenardo and Frank Cavanaugh were going to be involved with lead singer of [[Adema]], Mark Chavez, in a band called State of Mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=31716|title= FILTER Mainman Says Fans Will Be \'Stunned\' By The Group\'s New Lineup|date=January 19, 2005|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> These rumors proved to be false.

===\'\'Anthems for the Damned\'\' (2007\xe2\x80\x932009)===
[[File:Filter, 2008.JPG|thumb|right|Filter in 2008]]
As Army of Anyone wound down, Patrick began working on material for a new Filter album, to eventually be titled \'\'[[Anthems for the Damned]]\'\'.  Released to the public in May 2008, it was more serious in tone than some expected and expresses more of his mixed emotions regarding the state of the world and the state of his life.

On March 7, 2008, it was announced that Frank Cavanagh had reunited with Filter and would play as a live member at the operation Myspace concert in [[Kuwait]]. It was confirmed at [[Operation MySpace]] that he would not be joining Filter on the full tour as he would be shipping off to [[Iraq]] in April.  The only song played live during the March 10 performance by Cavanagh, now a Sergeant and Paralegal in the U.S. Army Reserve, was the band\'s first mainstream hit, "Hey, Man, Nice Shot".

Patrick also announced a remix album to \'\'Anthems for the Damned\'\' on November 4, titled \'\'Remixes for the Damned\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Powers |first=Nicole |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Filter+For+The+Damned |title=Filter For The Damned (09/2008) |publisher=Suicide Girls |date=September 13, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}</ref> \'\'Remixes for the Damned\'\' was released on November 21, 2008 in the U.S. and [[Canadian Territories|Canada]]. The remix album was released internationally on December 1, 2008. The lead-off single was "I Keep Flowers Around".

A greatest hits album entitled \'\'[[The Very Best Things (1995-2008)]]\'\' was released March 31, 2009.  It featured tracks from all four previous studio albums and various movie soundtrack contributions, but no new content. There are 14 tracks total, with some tracks being radio edits.

===\'\'The Trouble with Angels\'\' (2009\xe2\x80\x932011)===
Filter started work working on a fifth album shortly after the release of the remix and greatest hits albums, with Bob Marlette as a producer. The album, as said by Richard Patrick, would be a lot heavier than \'\'Anthems for the Damned\'\' and is to have a song written for the Amalgamut on it. He also stated he would be moving away from the political lyrical content present in \'\'Anthems for the Damned\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=430 |title=Fender News |publisher=Fender.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>
When asked about the direction of his upcoming music style in an interview with [[Suicide Girls]] on September 13, 2008, Patrick said, "Actually the stuff I\xe2\x80\x99m writing right now for a record that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to release sometime next year is actually way more heavy industrial, more electronic. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to be that many live drums on it."
It\'s important to note that he originally saw this album releasing in 2009, while it obviously slipped into 2010.

Richard Patrick has stated on the Filter website that he has been recording songs for movies recently. Filter covered the song "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" by [[The Turtles]] for the soundtrack to the movie \'\'[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]\'\' (2009). The song features ambient sound with alternative metal. It can be heard on their Myspace profile. It was also used in a promo for the seventh season of [[Criminal Minds]] and also a trailer for [[Baz Luhrmann]]\'s \'\'[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]\'\' (2013).

Filter also contributed a new song "Fades Like a Photograph" for the soundtrack of the movie \'\'[[2012 (film)|2012]]\'\' (2009).  The song saw Patrick reuniting with former Filter co-conspirator, Brian Liesegang, who co-produced the track.

Through the end of 2009 and into 2010, released a series of fourteen studio updates chronicling the progress made on the album. Each update touched on a certain part of the album process, such as "recording guitar parts" or "mixing the album". The last studio updates confirmed that the album recording had been completed. In their last studio video update, Richard Patrick showcased two clips from final mixed songs on iTunes that listed track listing and track lengths. While the video was legitimate, it was not the actual final track list, it was only a collection of new Filter songs on a playlist.

Filter released "The Inevitable Relapse", as their first single on May 26. The song was made available on the band\'s official website as a free digital download. \'\'[[The Trouble with Angels (album)|The Trouble with Angels]]\'\' was released on August 17, 2010 on the Rocket Science Ventures record label.

After the album\'s release, the band also released a cover of [[ZZ Top]]\'s hit single "[[Gimme All Your Lovin\']]" which appears on the compilation \'\'ZZ Top: A Tribute From Friends\'\'.

===\'\'The Sun Comes Out Tonight\'\' (2012\xe2\x80\x932013)===
Patrick and Jonathan Radtke entered the studio with producer [[Bob Marlette]] in April 2012 to work on the sixth Filter studio album, titled \'\'[[The Sun Comes Out Tonight]]\'\'.<ref name="loudwire1">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/filter-heading-to-the-studio-in-april/ |title=Filter Heading to the Studio in April |publisher=Loudwire.com |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> The first single off the new album, "What Do You Say", was released on April 2, 2013. A track entitled "We Hate It When You Get What You Want" is available on the band\'s official site as a free download (for a limited time). The official track listing for the album was released on March 18, 2013. The album was released on June 4, 2013. Phil Buckman announced that he has left Filter on October 1, 2013 after finishing a tour in support of Stone Temple Pilots.<ref name="AllAccess">{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/rock/future-releases |title=Future Releases |publisher=AllAccess.com |date= |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winduprecords.com/news/filter-new-album-release/ |title=Filter \xe2\x80\x93 New Album Release |publisher=Wind-up Records |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> [[Tim Kelleher (musician)|Tim Kelleher]], former bassist for [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] joined Filter in October 2013.

===Seventh studio album (2014-present)===
In August 2014, Patrick announced his intention to work on a seventh studio album in late 2014.<ref name="altnat">http://www.alternativenation.net/?p=53893</ref> He aims to keep recording time short, with the goal of releasing the album in 2015.<ref name="altnat"/> Patrick states that he plans on writing again with Radtke, and this time also with touring members Hayden Scott and Tim Kelleher.<ref name="altnat"/> On June 8, 2014, Patrick announced via Facebook that former guitarist [[Geno Lenardo]] has been extended an invitation to write music with the band. Patrick later commented that he was unsure if Lenardo would be able to commit to the formal recording sessions or not.<ref name="altnat"/> Patrick later announced that he would be collaborating again Liesegang, with whom he created \'\'Short Bus\'\', and producer [[Ben Grosse]], who produced \'\'Title of Record\'\' and \'\'The Amalgamut\'\'.<ref name="ism">http://www.indiesourcemag.com/Music/2112/FILTER-IN-STUDIO-TO-RECORD-7TH-STUDIO-ALBUM-US-MARCH---APRIL-TOUR-WITH-COAL-CHAMBER</ref> Patrick also confirmed that the band would be in the studio in February 2015, and would then go on tour with [[Coal Chamber]] through March and April.<ref name="ism"/>

For some of album\'s recording sessions for the album, the band announced the ability to watch to [[livestream]] half hour or hour intervals of the band in the studio, costing $175 for a half hour, or $300 for a full hour.<ref>http://www.musicinstrumentsartists.com/2014/11/20/watch-filter-create-new-album-studio/</ref>

On March 4, 2015, Radtke announced he had left the band to pursue other musical interests.<ref>https://twitter.com/JonnyRadtke/status/573310759595212800</ref> Shortly after, Filter\'s Facebook page updated its members, indicating that an entirely new touring lineup would support Patrick, including Oumi Kapila, Ashley Dzerigian, Chris Reeve.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/Filter/info?tab=page_info</ref>

On March 30th, Filter launched a five month campaign with PledgeMusic, offering fans the opportunity to have exclusive insights into the writing and recording of the new record. Fans were also given the chance to pre-order the record and purchase limited-time bundles and signed merchandise to help fund studio costs. The untitled seventh album is slated to be released in late August/early September 2015. <ref>http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/filter</ref>

On April 2nd, the band performed live on \'\'[[The Anthony Cumia Show]]\'\'.

\'\'\'Foetus\'\'\' is the primary musical outlet of [[J. G. Thirlwell]]. Until 1995 the band underwent various name changes, all including the word \'\'[[fetus|foetus]]\'\'. Monikers adopted at different times include \'\'\'Foetus Under Glass\'\'\', \'\'\'You\'ve Got Foetus on Your Breath\'\'\' and \'\'\'Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel\'\'\'. After 1995 the name permanently became \'\'\'Foetus\'\'\', though the related project \'\'\'The Foetus Symphony Orchestra\'\'\' was founded in 1997 and continues.

Thirlwell acts as the sole instrumentalist, vocalist, songwriter and producer for all Foetus works and as such is the only member of the band. Other artists may occasionally collaborate with Thirlwell on Foetus works but are not considered members of Foetus. Thirlwell is solely responsible for the musical output of the band.

J. G. Thirlwell has many side-projects, in which he frequently goes by the name [[Clint Ruin]]. One such grouping is [[Wiseblood (band)|Wiseblood]] with former [[Swans (band)|Swans]] member [[Roli Mosimann]]. The material tends toward the realm of the darkest and most sexual Foetus songs, with Mosimann\'s Swans lineage showing in the slow, crushing pacing of many tracks. Thematically, Wiseblood\'s lyrics center around the misanthropic exertion of power, typically via murder, sex or assault. Wiseblood existed on-and-off from the mid-1980s through early 1990s.

==Name variations==
Thirlwell has released singles as \'\'\'Foetus Under Glass, Phillip & His Foetus Vibrations, Foetus Over Frisco, Foetus Art Terrorism, You\'ve Got Foetus on Your Breath, Foetus \xc3\x9cber Frisco, The Foetus All Nude Revue, Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel, Foetus, Inc.\'\'\', and \'\'\'Foetus\'\'\'.

In terms of full length studio albums, Thirlwell has issued material as Scraping Foetus Off The Wheel, You\'ve Got Foetus on Your Breath, and Foetus, as well as \'\'\'Foetus Interruptus\'\'\' and \'\'\'The Foetus Symphony Orchestra\'\'\'.  Live albums have been credited to Foetus and Foetus, Inc., as well as \'\'\'Foetus Corruptus\'\'\' and \'\'\'Foetus in Excelsis Corruptus Deluxe\'\'\'.

Other name variations exist, but are more difficult to come by.  A 1981 compilation appearance credits the artist as \'\'\'Foetus in Your Bed\'\'\'.  Two previously unreleased tracks on the 1989 compilation \'\'Sink\'\' are credited to \'\'\'Foetus Eruptus\'\'\'.  A guest appearance on [[Marc Almond]]\'s 1983 \'\'Marc and the Mambas\'\' album is credited to \'\'\'Jim Foetus and The Transvestites From Hell\'\'\'.<ref>http://weird.gmxhome.de/PAGES/discog4.html</ref>

Finally, in 1985, the band issued a box in which to house their various releases; the box contained no music, but was credited to \'\'\'The Foetus Of Excellence\'\'\'.  The front cover also listed the various Foetus-based aliases under which Thrilwell had recorded, and would record in the future.  In addition to almost all the above names, three name variations were included that have not (to date) issued any material: \'\'\'Foetus \xc3\x9cber Alles, Foetus Flesh\'\'\' and \'\'\'Foetus On The Beach\'\'\'.<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Foetus-Of-Excellence-The-The-Foetus-Of-Excellence/release/562585</ref>  Foetus On The Beach was scheduled to release a triple album in 1985, and even had a catalogue number assigned to the project, but the work remains unissued.<ref>http://weird.gmxhome.de/PAGES/discog4.html</ref>

==Conceptual themes==
All full-length Foetus album titles are four-letter, one-[[syllable]] words, often with multiple connotations.

The artwork of Foetus releases shows a deliberate progression of colour: the earliest releases are black and white, with the addition of red on the \'\'[[Deaf (album)|Deaf]]\'\' album, and further addition of yellow on \'\'[[Nail (album)|Nail]]\'\'.  Full-color art was introduced on \'\'[[Gash (Foetus album)|Gash]].\'\'<ref>[http://www.foetus.org/text/axcess1.html Foetus.org]</ref> Beginning with \'\'[[Flow (Foetus album)|Flow]]\'\', the artwork of primary albums reverted to black/white/red, though other releases continue in full colour.

The \'\'\'Genitorturers\'\'\' are an [[industrial metal]]<ref name="genmciver"/> band from the [[United States]], with influences extending into the 1990s [[hardcore punk]] and [[electronic music]]. They proclaim themselves to be "The World\'s Sexiest Rock Band".

==History==
Originating in [[Orlando, Florida]], the band was founded by [[singing|lead singer]] Gen while attending [[Pre-medical|pre-med]].<ref name="smbio">{{cite web|title=Genitorturers -Biography|url=http://www.season-of-mist.com/bands/genitorturers|publisher=Season of Mist|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>  Originally called The Festering Genitorturers, the band consisted of Marisa (vocals), Yvonne (guitar), Gen (bass), Larry (guitar) and Mike (drums).  Their first performance was at the Ocean Club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in late 1986.  Also on the bill was Declared Ungovernable, Belching Penguins, and The Rhythm Pigs.  Shortening their name to The Genitorturers, the band underwent various personnel changes and progressed in the 1990s [[Florida]] "hardcore" music scene,<ref name="smbio" /> with contemporary bands such as [[Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids]],<ref name="bhr">{{cite web|last=Booth|first=Mitch|title=The Genitorturers \xe2\x80\x93 Blackheart Revolution|url=http://www.metalobsession.net/2010/03/16/the-genitorturers-blackheart-revolution/|publisher=Metal Obsession|accessdate=30 May 2014|date=16 March 2010}}</ref> who would also become a success in later years.  According to the band\'s official biography, "What emerged would be a band that would go beyond shaking up the house that \'Mickey\' built and extend to paving the way and breaking ground for performance based music artists thereafter worldwide".<ref name="lv">{{cite web|title=Genitorturers|url=http://livevan.com/genitorturers|publisher=Live Van|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref>

In 1993, [[IRS Records]] owner [[Miles Copeland III]] sent his assistant [[Nick Turner]] (former drummer for [[The Lords of the New Church]]) to see the band perform. The quality of the performance, as well as their musical style containing fused elements of hardcore punk, metal and industrial electronics, led them to a record contract.<ref name="smbio" /><ref name="lv" /> Soon after that, they would record \'\'[[120 Days of Genitorture]]\'\'.<ref name="lv" />  After recording this album, [[Morbid Angel]] bassist/vocalist [[David Vincent]] (Gen\'s husband) joined the Genitorturers on bass. He left Morbid Angel in 1995, after the album \'\'[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]\'\', to join his wife\'s band.<ref name="smbio" />

The band has extensively toured the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and [[Europe]], and is internationally renowned for its exploits, [[pornographic]] show content.<ref name="lv" /><ref>{{cite web|title=About Genitorturers|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/genitorturers/biography/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>

By the time of their second album \'\'[[Sin City (Genitorturers album)|Sin City]]\'\' in 1998, Genitorturers had gained a notable reputation with their flamboyant [[BDSM]]-themed shows resulting in the band appearing in various television features in the USA; including [[VH1]], [[Fox News]], \'\'[[Hard Copy]]\'\', HBO\'s \'\'[[Real Sex]]\'\' and Playboy TV\'s \'\'[[Sexcetera]]\'\'.<ref name="smbio" /><ref name="lv" />

The \'\'[[Flesh is the Law]]\'\' EP includes the track "Lecher Bitch", which was also included in the November 2004 [[video game]] \'\'[[Vampire: The Masquerade \xe2\x80\x93 Bloodlines]]\'\'.<ref name="lv" /> Earlier releases included \'\'[[Machine Love]]\'\', which contains a cover of [[Divinyls]]\' hit "I Touch Myself", which was produced by [[Dave Ogilvie]] and [[Rob Zombie]] producer [[Scott Humphrey]].<ref name="lv" />

In 2004, Genitorturers featured in a 12 page spread in the monthly pornographic publication \'\'[[Hustler]]\'\', the magazine\'s only multi-page spread with a rock band.<ref name="smbio" />  \'\'Hustler\'\' described Genitorturers as "the world\'s sexiest band".<ref name="lv" /><ref name="mnt1">{{cite web|last=Handelsman|first=Jason|title=The Genitorturers|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-10-25/music/the-genitorturers/|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=30 May 2014|date=25 October 2007}}</ref>

In 2006, they toured Australia with [[Dead Inside the Chrysalis]].<ref name="bhr" />  In the autumn of 2007, they released their live DVD \'\'[[Live in Sin]]\'\', also selling autographed copies on [[eBay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Genitorturers Tickets for Sale|url=http://www.ticketspecialists.com/concerts/genitorturers_tickets.htm|publisher=Ticket Specialists|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref>

The band\'s last album, \'\'[[Blackheart Revolution]]\'\', was released in 2009.<ref name="bhr" />  In 2014, Genitorturers celebrated over 20 years since the release of their debut album by going on tour, \'20 Years of Depravity\'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Genitorturers Celebrate 20 Years of Depravity|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:UmcNK5cS4v8J:www.examiner.com/article/genitorturers-celebrate-20-years-of-depravity+&cd=14&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk|publisher=www.examiner.com|accessdate=31 May 2014|date=12 January 2014}}</ref>

\'\'\'Godhead\'\'\', occasionally typeset as \'\'\'gODHEAD\'\'\', is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Washington, D.C.]] They are most often credited with being the only band signed to musician [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]]\'s short-lived [[vanity label]], [[Posthuman Records]].

==History==
The band was formed in 1994 under the early moniker Blind, but made their first performance as Godhead shortly after in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] that April. After fairly remaining in obscurity for a number of years, the band was noticed by [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]], frontman of the [[Marilyn Manson (band)|band of the same name]], and in 2000 signed a [[record contract]] with Manson, making them the first act of Posthuman Records.<ref>Saidman, Sorelle: "Manson Signs Godhead To Posthuman", http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429563/20000505/godhead.jhtml. MTV.com, 2000.</ref> This deal culminated with the release of their breakthrough [[studio album]] in January 2001 entitled, \'\'[[2000 Years of Human Error]]\'\',<ref>Nelson, Chris: \'\'Album Reviews\'\', http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/marilynmanson/albums/album/98611/review/5944948/2000_years_of_human_error. Rolling Stone, 2001.</ref> which earned Godhead recognition by [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and landed them a spot on [[Ozzfest]]<ref>Ozzfest.com: \'\'Ozzfest Alumni\'\', http://www.ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html.</ref> where the band headlined the second stage that same year. The album featured additional contributions by Marilyn Manson bassist [[Jeordie White|Twiggy Ramirez]], [[Scott Putesky]] (original guitarist for Marilyn Manson, formerly known as [[Daisy Berkowitz]]), as well as Manson himself. Despite being briefly hindered by the dissolution of Posthuman, the band has steadily developed a following since their breakthrough.  In the early years the band was managed by [[Scott Cohen (music business)|Scott Cohen]].

Drummer [[James O\'Connor (drummer)|James O\'Connor]] left the band prior to the recording of their fifth studio album, \'\'[[Evolver (Godhead album)|Evolver]]\'\'. He was replaced by [[Tom Z]], who remained with the band for a very short time before being replaced by former [[Static-X]] drummer [[Ken Jay]]. Both Static-X\'s [[Wayne Static]] and [[Reeves Gabrels]], best known for his long partnership with [[England|English]] musician [[David Bowie]], would contribute to the album, which was released in 2003. In 2005, frontman Jason C. Miller invited O\'Connor to return as the band\'s drummer to which he accepted, though he departed from Godhead for a second time in 2006, following the completion of \'\'[[The Shadow Line]]\'\'. He was replaced this time by Glendon Crain.

On March 24, 2008, the band revealed that that [[Ty Smith]] of [[Bullets and Octane]] would be replacing Crain as drummer. Shortly after, the band announced their plans to release a DVD featuring a special acoustic performance held in [[Los Angeles, California]] earlier in the year, and as well announced their seventh studio album as in production. This album, later confirmed to be titled \'\'At the Edge of the World\'\', features studio material, as well as five [[remix]]es, and contains artwork by English artist Sam Shearon.

Throughout their career, Godhead has toured on their own, as well as with Ozzfest, Marilyn Manson, [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Rammstein]], [[Mudvayne]], [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]], [[Static-X]], [[Ra (U.S. band)|Ra]], [[Ill Ni\xc3\xb1o]], [[The Dreaming (US band)|The Dreaming]], [[Gravity Kills]], [[Soil (band)|Soil]] and [[American Head Charge]]. In late October\xe2\x80\x93December 2007, they toured in support of [[Jonathan Davis and the SFA]].

Jason C. Miller is owner of Central Command Studios.

On October 27, 2009, Jason C. Miller released his first solo album, \'\'[[Last To Go Home (album)|Last To Go Home]]\'\'.

==Musical style and influences==
On their official [[MySpace]] profile, the band credits [[David Bowie]], [[The Cure]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Nine Inch Nails]] as their influences.

\'\'\'Gravity Kills\'\'\' is an American [[industrial rock]] band from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Their music was described by one critic as "a blending of eerie industrial rock with a pop-infused melodic chorus and a bit of hard-core head banging."<ref name="WashTimes1">Jacquie Kubin, "Jamming across generations; 
Bo Diddley, Kirchen together; Gravity Kills seeks new momentum." [[Washington Times]], January 31, 2002.</ref>

The band was formed in 1994. They had their first hit single with "[[Guilty (Gravity Kills song)|Guilty]]", a track later released on their self-titled album \'\'[[Gravity Kills (album)|Gravity Kills]]\'\'. Gravity Kills\' songs were featured on the soundtracks for \'\'[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]\'\', \'\'[[Seven (film)|Se7en]]\'\', \'\'[[Escape from L.A.]]\'\', and \'\'[[Kissing a Fool]]\'\', as well as video games like [[Test Drive Off-Road]]. They have toured with such bands as [[Sevendust]] and [[Pigface]].

The band released two additional albums of new material, \'\'[[Perversion (album)|Perversion]]\'\' in 1998 and \'\'[[Superstarved]]\'\' in 2002, as well as a remix album in 1997. Their singles "[[Falling (Gravity Kills song)|Falling]]", from \'\'[[Perversion (album)|Perversion]]\'\' and "[[Superstarved#One Thing|One Thing]]", from \'\'[[Superstarved]]\'\', achieved minor success.

In August 1999, drummer Kurt Kerns left the band to pursue a career in architecture. Gravity Kills departed [[TVT Records]] and signed to [[Sanctuary Records]] & drummer Brad Brooker joined the band to perform & release the third album \'\'[[Superstarved]]\'\'. Following a severe injury to keyboardist Doug Firley\'s hands, and lack of tour support from their record label, they were unable to complete a tour for \'\'Superstarved\'\' and broke up in 2003.

Since 2006, Gravity Kills has reunited for occasional one-off festivals and shows, and is now working on new material.

== History ==

=== Formation, name and mainstream success (1994&ndash;1996)  ===

As the band was forming in 1994, keyboardist Doug Firley was reading an article where he misread what he thought said "like the Gravity Kills." He went back through the article and could not find what he thought he had read. Doug told drummer Kurt Kerns and guitarist Matt Dudenhoeffer about it and thought that Gravity Kills would be a great name for the band. Kurt and Matt really made sense of the name when comparing what they were doing with music (deconstructing samples and noise) to an architect they were both into named [[Lebbeus Woods]] and his theories regarding deconstruction and ultimately reconstruction.
In response to a contest from St. Louis area radio station [[KPNT]] for a compilation CD of local artists, keyboardist/programmer Doug Firley, guitarist Matt Dudenhoeffer and drummer/bassist Kurt Kerns brought in vocalist Jeff Scheel to record and mix a track in one week during the summer of 1994.<ref name="ScheelBlog">{{Cite web |url=http://jeffscheel.blogspot.com/2011/01/story.html |title=The White Light: The Story |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |author=Jeff Scheel}}</ref>  The resulting song, "Guilty," was given heavy airplay and quickly became the number one-requested song at the station.<ref name="ScheelBlog" /> The band continued to write and record songs and subsequently signed with [[TVT Records]].<ref name="ScheelBlog2">{{Cite web |url=http://jeffscheel.blogspot.com/2011/01/rest-of-story.html |title=The White Light: The Rest of the Story |accessdate=June 13, 2011 |author=Jeff Scheel}}</ref><ref name="BillBoard1996">Carrie Borzillo, "Gravity Kills Gives TVT Pull" \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\', June 22, 1996.</ref>

=== Self-tiled debut album, film appearances and tours (1994&ndash;1996) ===

The band\'s first self-titled album was released in March 1996. "Guilty", the first single, charted in the top 10 at nearly every Modern Rock Radio station in the country. The first album also produced top 10 singles Enough, Down and Blame. More music videos would soon follow for Enough and Blame. Hollywood also embraced the band\'s music as they landed songs on 3 high-profile soundtracks: Seven, [[Mortal Kombat (soundtrack)|Mortal Kombat]] and [[Escape from L.A.#Soundtrack|Escape from L.A.]] In addition, the song Last was featured in the film [[Kissing A Fool#Soundtrack|Kissing a Fool]].
Gravity Kills toured in the summer of 1996 with the Sex Pistols and embarked on a solo tour that fall.<ref name="WashTimes2">Amy Hutchinson, "\'Gravity\' takes music into the \'dark side\'; Band is part of emerging industrial sound from underground out into the mainstream." [[Washington Times]], October 10, 1996.</ref> With the success of the first album, the band quickly established itself on the rock scene as one of the most promising young bands in the industrial music scene.<ref name="BillBoard1996" /> Gravity Kills\'s album was also released worldwide with chart success in [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[France]].

===\'\'Manipulated\'\', live tours and \'\'Perversion\'\' (1997&ndash;2001)===
In 1997, TVT Records released a remix-complication album called \'\'[[Manipulated]]\'\' which contains remixes and covers of their [[Gravity Kills (album)|Self-titled]] debut album songs "[[Guilty (Gravity Kills song)|Guilty]]," "Blame," "Enough," "[[Down (Gravity Kills song)|Down]]" and "Here."
On April 19, 1998, Jeff Scheel suffered a whiplash when he got overexcited during a warm-up gig in the April 19 show at the University Wellness & Activities in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He had not performed live with the band since previous live concert at the Q101 Festival in [[Chicago, IL]] on October 16, 1997, during the club in what was supposed to be a low-key gig that attracted 6,000 fans, according to the band\'s label, TVT Records. Ironically, the injury, which will put Jeff Scheel out of commission for a few weeks, came less than a week before [[Junkie XL]] leader [[Tom Holkenborg]] injured his back in an onstage accident. Junkie XL and Gravity Kills were scheduled to join British band [[Pitchshifter]] on a U.S. tour on June 3.
The band released the second studio album on 9 June 1998, \'\'[[Perversion (album)|Perversion]].\'\' The album was less successful than their self-titled debut but still sold well, rising to No.&nbsp;107 on the Billboard Top 200 chart.<ref name="BillBoard1998">Carrie Borzillo, "BILLBOARD 200" \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\', July 18, 1998.</ref> The single \'"[[Falling (Gravity Kills song)|Falling]]" was featured in a 1998 car-racing video game, [[Test Drive 5]] along with the Pitchshifter, [[Fear Factory]], Junkie XL and [[KMFDM]] songs, while "Drown" charted in Germany. On July 1, 1998 at the [[Summerfest]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Jeff Scheel got the whole crowd chanting "Fuck you!" while the show was being broadcast live on a [[mainstream rock]] local radio station, [[Lazer 103|Lazer 103 FM]]. This was a familiar phrase to the July 2, 1997 Summerfest. The station\'s DJ tried to get the crowd to stop, but he was having mic problems and the crowd ignored him.
In August 1999, drummer Kurt Kerns had left the band, reasons for leaving as a chance for him to spend time with his family and to return to practicing architecture.<ref name="PressRelease">{{Cite web |url=http://grantb.net/gk/articles/kurtleaves.txt |title=Press Release about Kurt Kurns leaving Gravity Kills (originally posted to gravitykills.com) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> Kurt\'s friend and guitarist Matt Dudenhoeffer says that "He is still close with the band and visits the recording studio regularly." The band later departed [[TVT Records]] and signed to Sanctuary Records.<ref name="SanctSigning">{{Cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20020203192439/http://www.sanctuaryrecordsgroup.com/sanctuary/gkillsarticle.html |title=Sanctuary Records announces the signing of Gravity Kills to the label (via archive.org) |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

===\'\'Superstarved\'\', Doug Firley\'s injury and split-up (2002&ndash;2003)===
On 19 May 2002, [[Sanctuary Records Group|Sanctuary Records]] released the third and final studio album \'\'[[Superstarved]]\'\'. The UK version of the album was released by [[Sanctuary Records Group#History|Mayan Records]] (which was a part of Sanctuary Records) and the Japan version of the album was released by [[Victor Entertainment]]. Just after the album\'s release, on May 3, 2002, Gravity Kills\'s keyboardist Doug Firley sustained serious injury to his hand in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] while performing in front of a sold out crowd. The injury occurred when Firley dropped the 300&nbsp;lb. steel custom-made, spring-loaded keyboard on his hand and shattering the bones in his right ring finger during the band\'s performance of their single "[[Superstarved#One Thing|One Thing]]". The band returned home to St. Louis after finishing the weekend shows in NJ and Rochester, NY for Doug to seek treatment and had to sell off the components of the recording studio it owned, thus ending the current cycle of tour dates and at one point, his xrays were post on the internet. Firley later underwent surgery to fix his hand.
On January 4, 2003, the band officially broke up, a statement posted on the site reads as follows:

{{cquote|[...]Your assumptions are true. Gravity Kills are no longer together and will not be producing music together under the name Gravity Kills. Each of the band members has moved on to other endeavors. The reasons for this are various and, unfortunately for legal reasons cannot be mentioned here. The band as always, appreciates all the support throughout the years and considers their fans to be the best fans in the world. Those band members still associated with the music industry hope to see you soon with their new projects.}}

The band members scattered to different occupations. Matt Dudenhoeffer returned to an engineering job, while Doug Firley went on tour with [[Alicia Keys]] as a keyboard tech and then worked as a draftsman before forming the production team Shock City Productions with Chris Loesch. Jeff Scheel went to work at the Box Talent Agency as a talent agent for corporate, casino and clubs.

=== Reformation, performances and future fourth studio album (2005&ndash;present) ===
On October 28, 2005, Gravity Kills reunited to perform for a self-created Halloween music festival in St. Louis, Missouri entitled "The Killoween Freakshow." This appears to be becoming an annual event, as another "Killoween" occurred on October 28, 2006, at Pop\'s nightclub and bar, featuring Gravity Kills and Fragile Porcelain Mice. Due to a scheduling conflict, Killoween was instead "The Nightmare Before Thanksgiving" on November 21, 2007. Gravity Kills confirmed rumors that have persisted over the past year on October 20, 2009 and the band has announced that they are working on new music. More recently, the band performed in Tulsa at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino on May 7, 2010, and at Roberts Orpheum Theater in St. Louis, MO on June 25, 2010 at 7:00pm part of a benefit show.<ref name="Twitter">{{Cite web |url=http://twitter.com/#!/GravityKillsSTL |title=Gravity Kills Twitter page |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

On 14 January 2011, Jeff Scheel revealed an unreleased music video for "Down" on [[YouTube]] and told some people on Facebook it was a "previously unreleased Gravity Kills video", he got the video from Kurt Kerns when Kurt recovered the video by capturing it on a videotape when it was aired and then he passed the videotape footage to Jeff. The band are currently working on their long-awaited follow-up and recently posted a [http://gravitykillsofficial.tumblr.com/ studio diary] regarding their progress, he has revealed a working title of one of the songs "Again".<ref name="test">[http://gravitykillsofficial.tumblr.com/post/10307099862/one-of-those-nights] One of those nights...</ref> Jeff Scheel is also the vocalist of Star 13 (stylized as *13).<ref name="Star13FB">{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Star-13/27860678875 |title=Star 13\'s Official Facebook}}</ref><ref name="Star13MS">{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/star13music |title=Star 13\'s Official Myspace}}</ref>

In August 2011 a piano cover of [http://soundcloud.com/jeff-scheel/beg-and-borrow-by-jeff-scheel Beg and Borrow] was released to SoundCloud.

\'\'This article is about the industrial music group. For the 2012 album named \'\'\'Greater Than One\'\'\', see [[Dwele]].\'\'

\'\'\'Greater Than One\'\'\' is an English [[electronic music]] band, founded by husband and wife Michael Wells and Lee Newman in 1985.  They released many albums under this name, and also under the names \'\'\'Tricky Disco\'\'\', \'\'\'GTO\'\'\', \'\'\'John + Julie\'\'\', \'\'\'Church of Extacy\'\'\', \'\'\'Signs of Chaos\'\'\', \'\'\'T.D.5\'\'\', \'\'\'Salami Brothers\'\'\', \'\'\'Killout Squad\'\'\', \'\'\'Technohead\'\'\' and \'\'\'L.E.D.\'\'\'. Only a few of their singles were commercially successful.  Since Newman\xe2\x80\x99s death on 4 August 1995 from [[cancer]], Wells continues to release music under some of these names, and also as \'\'\'The Man\'\'\' and \'\'\'S.O.L.O.\'\'\'

==1985: Greater Than One==
In 1985, Newman and Wells met at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]], formed Greater Than One, and released their first album \'\'Kill the Pedagogue\'\' on cassette.  During the late 1980s they organised art installations and exhibitions accompanied by their own music: "When the whole audience were in, we started a soundtrack ... war sirens and searchlights. This was designed to disorientate the audience, throwing them into an unexpected nightmare. After the shock, Islamic chanting began which then changed to \'\'Song For England\'\', during which we came onstage wearing illuminous skull masks...".<ref name=godsend>[http://www.prongs.org/godsend/gto.html Godsend Magazine volume 13], accessed 15 June 2007.</ref> They formed their own [[record label|label]] \'\'Kunst=Kapital\'\' and released four further albums under this alias between 1987 and 1990.

{{anchor|tricky}}

==1990: First hits==
Their first hit single was the trance record "Pure" as GTO on [[Chrysalis Records]], a club hit around Europe, closely followed by "Tricky Disco" as Tricky Disco on [[Warp records]], which peaked at number 14 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in July 1990.<ref name="every hit">[http://www.everyhit.com/ EveryHit.com UK Top 40 Hit Database], accessed 15 June 2007.</ref><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 18" />

They used many aliases because, releasing so much material, they feared the press would not write about it all, if they knew it all came from the same band.  As Newman said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you give them a Tricky Disco one week and then a John and Julie two weeks later and GTO a month later they\xe2\x80\x99ll write about all of it\xe2\x80\x9d.<ref name=WUNH>[http://www.brainwashed.com/gto/ Interview with New Hampshire radio station WUNH circa 1990], accessed 15 June 2006.</ref> Their aliases also allowed them to release different types of material on different [[record label]]s. The single "Double Happiness" as John and Julie appeared on [[XL Recordings]]; the 1993 \'\'Tip of the Iceberg\'\' album as GTO was released on [[Resist Music|REACT]], and the 1995 album \'\'Headsex\'\' as Technohead appeared on [[Mokum Records]].

\'\'\'Hanzel und Gretyl\'\'\' are an American [[industrial metal]] band, formed by members Kaizer Von Loopy and Vas Kallas in February 1993. In the 1990s, their sound was described as a genre-defying blend of sci-fi metal/electronic and experimental, but into the new millennium they invoked a  heavier sound leaning more towards aggressive metal. Due to their heavy use of German lyrics, Germanic  imagery, and German-sounding pseudonyms, they are often mistaken for being a German band, and are largely regarded as the only existing American [[Neue Deutsche H\xc3\xa4rte]] band of note. Contrary to a generalized public perception,  Kaizer Von Loopy and Vas Kallas are based in New York City to which they are native, and neither of them are German or of German descent.

==History==

===Machines Good People Bad (1993-1999)===
Hanzel und Gretyl formed in early 1993. In April, 1994, they completed a demo entitled "Kindermusik". Of the 200 cassette tapes manufactured, most were sent to record labels and fanzines and some were sold on consignment at a local music store called Bleeker Bob\'s. In January 1995, after refusing offers from at least one major label to resubmit their demo with only English lyrics, they signed with Energy Records, an indie record label based in New York City. HuG recorded and released their first full-length album, \'\'[[Ausgeflippt]]\'\', in October 1995. With lyrics in five different languages and no two songs sounding alike, the album made a clear statement as deviating from the often predictable and monochromatic themes of many electro and industrial bands of the time. The single "Shine 2001" topped the [[Alternative Press]] dance chart at No.&nbsp;1 shortly after its release. Performing only several local shows on Manhattan\'s lower east side, they immediately embarked on two US tours with [[Marilyn Manson]]. The first in 1995 with [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] as direct support and again in 1996 as direct support for Manson themselves.

In 1997, they released their second full-length album, \'\'[[Transmissions From Uranus]]\'\', that featured a video game in which the object was to transform Loopy and Vas into alien-like insectoid space creatures. The enhanced CD was again cited for its progressive-minded musical stylings and groundbreaking technological advances. This led the band to tour the US extensively with [[Tommy Victor]]\'s [[Prong (band)|Prong]], giving them even broader exposure nationally. In between shows on Prong\'s Cold Fusion tour, Hanzel und Gretyl headlined a Halloween show in Des Moines, Iowa with hometown band [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] in direct support. During the same year, Hanzel und Gretyl\'s song "9D Galactik Center" appeared in [[New Line Cinema]]\'s \'\'[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]\'\' and was also played at the 1997 [[MTV Music Awards]]. Furthermore, the song "Robot Logik" from the same album was used in radio commercials for the \'\'[[Howard Stern Show]]\'\'.
  
In 1998, clad in custom-made lederhosen,  Hanzel und Gretyl  toured the US in direct support of Germany\'s venerable [[Rammstein]] on the band\'s first ever headlining tour of the states after meeting and playing with the band at a [[CMJ Music Marathon]] show in New York City. HuG also supported [[Rob Halford]]\'s [[2wo]] in Los Angeles during the Rammstein tour.

In 1999 Hanzel und Gretyl completed a full-length CD entitled \'\'Oz Faktor\'\' that is currently unreleased by Energy Records. The CD depicts a displaced Hanzel und Gretyl lost in a quasi-"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|Wizard of Oz]]" type setting.

===Fukken \xc3\x9cber (2002- 2013)===
After a long hiatus due to the dissolving of their label, Energy Records, the band signed to [[Metropolis Records]] in 2002 and immediately began recording for their long anticipated third album, \'\'[[\xc3\x9cber Alles (album)|\xc3\x9cber Alles]]\'\'. Described by Kaizer Von Loopy as a "futuristic Wagnerian rock opera" and released in 2003, it marked a distinct stylistic change for the band favoring heavy guitar riffs and Germanic themes over the more genre expanding electro-metal  style for which they had become known in the 90s. The CD was met with a fair amount of controversy over its parodic cross-referencing of both German and American stereotypes set against a surreal and spaced-out WWII backdrop but nevertheless attained a four out of five star review in [[Kerrang!]] magazine and equally high praise from New York City\'s prestigious \'\'[[The Village Voice]]\'\'. Following the release of the album, the band toured the US as a headliner on their aptly named "Fukken Uber Tour" and later in direct support of  The [[Genitorturers]] in the states and Canada after which they returned to the studio to record a new album.
In September 2004, the band released their fourth album, \'\'[[Scheissmessiah]]\'\'. The album was immediately hailed as required listening for fans of industrial metal alongside [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[KMFDM]] and Ministry by [[Revolver Magazine]]. Served up devilishly as a "[[Handel\'s Messiah]] from hell", HuG continued to grow harder and heavier touring the states in support of [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]] and in direct support of [[Al Jourgensen]]\'s [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] for a three-month stint on their "Evil Doer Tour" throughout the US and Canada. Hanzel und Gretyl co-headlined, along with [[Slick Idiot]], the first Gothicfest at the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Illinois. In 2006, the band toured across America and Canada as a headliner  with label mates [[Bella Morte]] in direct support upon the release of the four-song EP "[[Oktotenfest 2006]]". With song titles like "Fukken Uber Death Party" and later "Bavarian Bierhaus Blood", HuG\'s home-brewed putsch soon led to a full-scale UK tour in direct support of [[Cradle of Filth]] in 2007. Shortly thereafter, they began work on their fifth full-length album, \'\'[[2012: Zwanzig Zw\xc3\xb6lf]]\'\', released in February 2008. Drawing more and more from [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] sentiments, \'\'2012\'\' is HuG\'s heaviest offering thus far leading to HuG\'s first-ever headlining shows overseas beginning in Moscow, Russia in September 2008.

In January 2009, Hanzel und Gretyl kicked off their extensive headlining "World Fukken Tour 2009" including shows throughout the US, Europe, UK, Scandinavia, Russia, Ukraine, New Zealand and Australia ending with a final show in New York City on December 19, 2009.
On  August 8, 2010, with the number 87 as the numerical representation of the band and the words "More German Than German" found on their backdrop and t-shirts Hanzel und Gretyl performed to a  capacity crowd on the main stage at [[M\'era Luna Festival]] in Hildesheim, Germany.

Born To Be Heiled, Hanzel und Gretyl\'s  6th full length CD release on November 27, 2012 was launched as a debut release for  the newly formed Metropolis Metal Records, a subdivision of Metropolis Records that focusses on their more metal based electronic and industrial bands.
Beginning in June 2012, HuG followed up the completion of Born To Be Heiled with multiple extensive headlining tours including Australia, New Zealand, US, Canada, Russia, and Europe.
"Hanzel und Gretyl F\xc3\xbcr Immer" an album composed entirely of remixes of their previous CD,  "Born To Be Heiled", was completed by "KyzrW\xc3\xb6lf",  Kaizer Von Loopy\'s electronically based solo project, in July 2013 and slated for worldwide release by [[Metropolis Records]] on October 8, 2013 .

====Grimm Shiza (2014-present)====

Oktober 2014 saw the release of HuG\'s 7th album, Black Forest Metal and the beginning of a new era for the band. Perhaps their darkest and most metal sounding release to date, BFM employs satanic themes cross-referenced with forest motifs from the original  Brothers Grimm fairy tale.  U.S. and European tours followed the release.

Hanzel und Gretyl is slated to release "Satanik Germanik", their 8th full length release in late 2015.

\'\'\'Hate Dept.\'\'\' is an American [[synthesizer]]-laden [[post punk]] band, formed in 1991 by Steven Seibold. The group releases albums and performs music in the same vein as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Skinny Puppy]] and [[The Prodigy]]. Seibold is a multi-instrumentalist who manages to write, record and release Hate Dept. albums without the aid of outside help. He formed Hate Dept. in 1991 in reaction to fickle \'electro\' audiences and antipathy towards live electronic bands, taking his sound in a more punk direction.<ref name=wlfmint/>

Hate Dept.\'s debut album in 1994, \'\'Meat.Your.Maker\'\', appeared in [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]\'s Top 10 alternative albums while Seibold was nominated \'Best New Talent\' by Keyboard Magazine. \'\'Omnipresent\'\', the second release by the group, again entered charts in Rolling Stone and [[Alternative Press]]. Hate Dept. had a brief period of commercial success after the release of the third album \'\'Technical Difficulties\'\'. The only single, \'\'Release It\'\', earned radio airplay in 50 North American markets.

Seibold joined [[Pigface]] in 2001, touring and recording with [[Martin Atkins]] in several projects. During this time, Hate Dept. released their fourth album \'\'Ditch\'\' in 2003. Although the band had publicly announced the release of the fifth studio album, \'\'A New Ghost.\'\' Production stalled and for years, fans were left with little more than rumors of random, unavailable songs.

In August 2013, 10 years after the release of \'\'Ditch\'\', Seibold announced via Facebook that a fifth studio album, now titled simply, \'\'New Ghost,\'\' was set for an August 27, independent release. Shortly after the announcement, this statement was posted:

\'\'"I\'m not ignoring the questions I\'ve been asked about the access and sale of the new album, \'New Ghost\', I\'m just thinking about the answer. If it is to be considered a luxury to be an \'independent artist\', one must treat it as such. We won\'t disappoint you. You\'ll hear it August 27th, see it, touch it, feel it and study it, shortly after if you chose to. And, if geography permits, we will perform close enough to you to once again make ears ring, shake hands and embrace..."\'\'

New Ghost was released Aug 2013 to much fan praise.  He also allowed many fans who he met on facebook to sing on a chorus vocal in the song Broken Rule, one fan included the singer of the band Gravity Kills.  Currently it\'s available at http://hatedept.bandcamp.com/album/new-ghost-2

In 2014 Seibold began posting videos of himself performing acoustic versions of many Hate Dept. songs discussing with his fans the possibility of acoustic shows in the future.

n 2014 Seibold released a trilogy of remix albums for New Ghost on http://hatedept.bandcamp.com/  When releasing those Hate Dept. became one of the first bands to allow some of there creative fans to remix there songs for actual release.  The fans (often going under there project name, solo or band names) featured on the remixes are: Produkt, Slighter, Sweat Boys, Cabo Joe & Chop Shop, Idiot Stare, Nick Meade, Julian Beeston, MSHAA, Murder Love God, Jeff Stumpp, Rijjet Rogets, Slighter, UCNX, I.X.XI, Steven OLaf, Messy Jax, GLI7CH, Ghost Echo, Scant Regard, The Raygun Girls, Robert Zelin, MulpHia, japaneseCARCRASH, Cursed Earth Corporation, Steven Madsen, Great Oz Digital, Microwaved, Holokade, Damsel in the Dollhouse, Slave Unit, mnpltr, Deathproof, ENDIF, Roger "gReen bEAn" Lopez, Kent Ward, musichatesyouall, Saemskin & Covered In Spiders.

\'\'\'In the Nursery\'\'\' are an [[England|English]] [[Neoclassical (Dark Wave)|neo-classical]]/[[Martial industrial|martial]] [[electronica]] band, known for their cinematic sound. The duo has provided [[soundtrack]]s to a variety of TV programmes and films, and is known for its rescoring of silent films.

==Career==
Twin brothers Klive and Nigel Humberstone and guitar player Anthony Bennett formed this [[Sheffield]]-based band in 1981. 

Influenced by [[Joy Division]],<ref name="Outsight">{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/InTheNurseryInterviewsOnOutsightRadioHours |title=In the Nursery interviews on Outsight Radio Hours : Outsight Radio Hours : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref> the trio originally tagged along with the [[UK]]\'s [[industrial music]] scene, releasing the six-track \'\'When Cherished Dreams Come True\'\' in June 1983. The "Witness (To A Scream)" single and \'\'Sonority\'\' EP followed before the band moved to the [[Sweatbox label]] for the fearsome \'\'Temper\'\' EP. 

The full-length \'\'Twins\'\' was recorded without the departed Bennett at Bradford\'s [[Flexible Response Studio]]. The album adopted a more subtle approach by favouring theatrical atmospherics over industrial clatter. Multi-lingual vocalist [[Dolores Marguerite C]] made her debut on the \'\'Trinity\'\' EP adding [[French language|French]] narration to "Elegy\'. Dolores and military-styled percussionist Q were added to the line-up on the subsequent \'\'Stormhorse\'\', the soundtrack to an imaginary film that provided the cinematic blueprint for all their future recordings. The quartet\'s final recording for Sweatbox, 1988\'s \'\'K\xc3\xb6da\'\', completed the transition to a classical instrumental sound and utilised computer sequencing in the recording process for the first time. 

Following the collapse of Sweatbox, the band moved to [[Third Mind Records]] to complete the delicate \'\'[[L\'Esprit]]\'\'. The album was recorded with engineer Steve Harris who had contributed to \'\'K\xc3\xb6da\'\' and would feature on all the band\'s subsequent releases. \'\'Sense\'\' and \'\'Duality\'\' were followed by a logical progression to real soundtrack work on 1993\'s psychological drama \'\'[[An Ambush of Ghosts]]\'\'. Their music has also featured in \'\'[[Interview with the Vampire]]\'\', \'\'[[Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie]]\'\', and \'\'[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]\'\'. In the late 90s the band was commissioned, as part of the [[Optical Music Series]], to provide new scores for the silent classics \'\'[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]\'\', \'\'[[Asphalt (1929 film)|Asphalt]]\'\', and \'\'[[Man with a Movie Camera]]\'\'. \'\'[[Anatomy of a Poet]]\'\', a concept album about the creative psyche, featured author [[Colin Wilson]] reciting romantic poetry against a lush backdrop of strings, and also included a cover version of [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]]\'s "Seventh Seal". 

A retrospective compilation of their work was the first release on their own [[ITN Corporation]] label. Further concept albums have included \'\'Deco\'\' (inspired by the [[Art Deco]] movement) and the ambitious \'\'Lingua\'\', an exploration of language featuring vocal contributions from around the world. The Humberstones also record more dance-oriented material under the \'\'Les Jumeaux\'\' moniker, and as such were involved in pre-production work on [[Sabres of Paradise]]\'s classic techno anthem "Smokebelch".

The 2011 release \'\'Blind Sound\'\' is a more consistently dark album from the Humberstone brothers and features more real percussion than previous releases.<ref name="Outsight"/> In 2011, "White Robe" from \'\'An Ambush of Ghosts\'\' was used on a trailer for \'\'[[Game of Thrones]]\'\'.<ref name="Outsight"/>

}}

\'\'\'Insurge\'\'\', commonly typeset \'\'\'iNsuRge\'\'\', were a [[political]] [[industrial rock]] band founded in 1994 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Chris Dubrow (ex-[[Soulscraper]]). Other founders were Mattieu MacRoth on bass guitar, Matt Richmond on drums, Jan Sebastian on percussion and Monique Wakelin on keyboards. Their debut album \'\'Power to the Poison People\'\'  was released in August 1996, which reached No.&nbsp;16 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].

Insurge combined [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] and audio loops with layers of [[Acoustic instrument|acoustic]] and [[electronic drums]] and found [[percussion]] (such as old kitchen sinks and other scrap metal) mixed with [[punk rock|punk]] influenced guitars. The sound was influenced by [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Gothic rock|goth]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[dance music|dance]] and [[Pub Rock (Australia)|Australian pub rock]].

The band was known for its outspoken political views which were particularly focused on global issues such as injustice in the [[developing world]], the political influence of corporations and [[financial markets]], and global environmental issues such as [[climate change]]. The bands politics were influenced by [[anarchism]], [[environmentalism]], [[anarcho-punk]], [[political economy]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]]. The band expressed their political views through their lyrics, interviews and live appearances.

==Early years==
The band\'s first E.P. was I.M.F (1994) coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The song criticised the I.M.F. based on its harsh economic measures that were having a detrimental effect on the developing world. Initially a demo, I.M.F attracted the attention of prominent Australian music manager John Woodruff ([[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]], [[Baby Animals]], [[Savage Garden]]) who helped pull together a distribution deal through East West records (Warner music Australia). The original line up was then solidified with Monique Wakelin playing [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], Mattieu McRoth on bass, Matt Richmond on electronic and acoustic Drums, and Paul Bianco (later Pauly B) on found Percussion joining Dubrow\xe2\x80\x99s guitar and vocals.<ref name="McFarlane I">{{cite book | last1 = McFarlane | first1 = Ian | authorlink1 = Ian McFarlane | title = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | chapter = Encyclopedia entry for \'iNsuRge\' | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040615133118/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=946 | chapter-url = http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=946 | accessdate = 22 August 2014 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | archivedate = 15 June 2004 | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 }}</ref>

Just prior to the release of the band\'s second EP there was a shift in the lineup with original percussionist Paul Bianco leaving the band to be replaced by Adam Logan.

The second E.P. \xe2\x80\x98Political Prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 (1995) saw Insurge begin to work with producer [[Kalju Tonuma]], ( [[The Mavis\'s]], [[28 Days]], [[Bodyjar]], [[Killing Joke]]). The title track became the band\xe2\x80\x99s breakthrough song, gaining considerable airplay from alternative radio across Australia and New Zealand. The lyrics discussed the inadequacy of modern [[criminal law]], and the idea that most prisoners in western society were political prisoners because the concept of [[private property]] was an invention to protect the wealthy.  The song went to No. 25 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100]] in 1995.

The Speculator EP followed in 1996, which was lyrically based on the anti-democratic power of global currency [[speculation]]. This song reached No. 7 on the [[4ZZZ]] Hot 100 chart and No. 69 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100]], of that year. The debut album \'\'Power to the Poison People\'\' was released in August 1996, which reached No.&nbsp;16 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name="AusCharts">{{cite web | url = http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Insurge | title = Discography \xe2\x80\x93 Insurge | publisher = Australian Charts Portal. Hung Medien (Steffen Hung) | last = Hung | first = Steffen | accessdate = 22 August 2014 }}</ref> The singles \xe2\x80\x98Soul 4 Sale\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x9cTime Bomb\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98AK 47\xe2\x80\x99 followed.

The band toured constantly across Australia (and once to New Zealand) including tours with [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], and participated in many festivals such as [[Alternative Nation Festival]] (1995), the [[Livid (festival)|Livid]] Festival (5th Oct 1996 \xe2\x80\x93 the same night Insurge programmed ABC TV\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98rage\xe2\x80\x99), and the [[Big Day Out]] (1996, 1997).

==Later years==
In 1998, singer Chris Dubrow went to London to record tracks with Ian Richardson and Nick Coler (known for their work with [[The KLF]]). Dubrow also became involved with the [[Reclaim the Streets]] movement in both London and Sydney. Over this period the line-up changed again, Mark \xe2\x80\x98Milli\xe2\x80\x99 Avery became the bass player and Daryl Sims (formerly [[Indecent Obsession]]) was on drums.

1999 saw the release of the single \xe2\x80\x98I Hate Stupid People\xe2\x80\x99 which achieved considerable national airplay on [[Triple J]], this was followed by the album \xe2\x80\x98Globalisation\xe2\x80\x99 ultimately produced by [[Kalju Tonuma]]. The singles were \xe2\x80\x98Feast or Famine\xe2\x80\x99 (1999) and \xe2\x80\x98Images of London\xe2\x80\x99 (2000), the latter a dance version of the song written by Indigenous Australian singer-songwriter [[Kev Carmody]]. Midway through 1999 there was yet another change to the lineup, with Sean Burnett taking the percussion role..

Insurge announced their break-up in 2000 at their final show at the [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] Festival, [[Sydney]].

In 2009 Insurge announced their reformation and in 2012 were billed as the support act for another reunion tour by 1990s band [[Def FX]].

They released a single album, and their songs featured in the video games \'\'[[Need for Speed: Underground]]\'\' and \'\'[[NHL series#NHL 2004|NHL 2004]]\'\'. Jerk supported [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Insane Clown Posse]], [[Killing Joke]] and [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] on their respective Sydney tours.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==History==
Jerk was originally composed of vocalist Michael Matral, drummer Lamar Lowder, guitarist Johnathan Devoy and Tourettes bass player Ross Empson. In this guise Jerk contributed the song "Jesus Saves" to the [[Mushroom Records]] soundtrack to the Australian horror film \'\'[[Cut (2000 film)|Cut]]\'\' in 2000. It was after this point that Jerk had a line-up change with Devoy on vocals joined by guitarist Charles Cilia and former Candy Harlots bassist Leeno Dee.

In 2001, Jerk released a self-titled six-track EP and three accompanying video clips directed by Lowder. These releases led to an appearance at the long-running [[Metal for the Brain]] festival in [[Canberra]] late in the year,{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} and in April 2002 Jerk signed to [[Sony Records]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/19/1063625206025.html|title=How to spot the next big thing|date=September 20, 2003|accessdate=6 January 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

In 2003, Jerk released their full-length album \'\'When Pure Is Defiled\'\',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/album-groupe-Jerk_%28AUS%29-nom_album-When_Pure_Is_Defiled-l-en.html|title=When Pure Is Defiled|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref> which was co-produced by [[Sean Beavan]] and Lamar Lowder. It included their 2002 single "I Hate People Like That", which peaked at No. 83 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] in November of that year. Music videos were subsequently produced for "I Hate People Like That", "Just What You Need", and the Lowder-directed "My Friends All Lie".{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Jerk embarked on a national tour in 2003 to promote the album, and performances included support slots for Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Killing Joke and Disturbed on the Sydney leg of their Australian tours. 

Jerk received exposure in the [[North America]]n market when their song, "Sucked In", featured in the soundtracks of the video games \'\'[[NHL series#NHL 2004|NHL 2004]]\'\' and \'\'[[Need for Speed: Underground]]\'\'.

Devoy stepped down, and was replaced by vocalist Mario Spate in 2004, but the band broke up soon after.{{when|date=November 2010}} Lowder has since returned to music production and songwriting. In January 2006, Dee and Cilia reunited with Devoy to form the band Ink. Ink subsequently released the EPs \'\'Lead\xe2\x80\xa6 Or Follow\'\' (2007) and \'\'Black Water Reign\'\' (2008).

On July 21, 2013, Devoy, Dee and Cilia reunited for a one-off acoustic Jerk gig. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roXNaSvJ7pY

==History==

===Formation and first three albums (1978\xe2\x80\x931982)===
[[Paul Ferguson|"Big" Paul Ferguson]] was drummer in the band of Mataya Clifford (a.k.a. Mat Stagger) when he met [[Jaz Coleman|Jeremy "Jaz" Coleman]]  (from [[Cheltenham, Gloucestershire]]) in [[Notting Hill, London, England|Notting Hill, London]]. In October 1978 (or early 1979), after Coleman was briefly keyboard player in that band, he and Ferguson left to form Killing Joke. They placed an advertisement in the music press which attracted guitarist [[Geordie Walker|Kevin "Geordie" Walker]] and bassist [[Martin Glover|Martin "Youth" Glover]]. According to Coleman, their [[manifesto]] was to "define the exquisite beauty of the [[atomic age]] in terms of style, sound and form".<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" /> {{Anchor|Coleman_on_the_name}} Coleman gave an explanation concerning their name: "the killing joke is like when people watch something like Monty Python on the television and laugh, when really they\'re laughing at themselves.  It\'s like a soldier in the first world war.  He\'s in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he\'s gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster\'s got him sussed - \'What am I doing this for? I don\'t want to kill anyone, I\'m just being controlled\'."<ref>{{cite work |title=Laugh At Your Peril With Killing Joke |work=Allied Propaganda |issue=3 |date=May 1979}}</ref> The band played a debut gig on 4 August 1979 at Cheltenham Witcombe Lodge supporting [[The Ruts]] and [[The Selecter]].

By September 1979, shortly before the release of their debut EP, \'\'[[Turn to Red]]\'\', they began the Malicious Damage [[record label]] with graphic artist Mike Coles as a way to press and sell their music;<ref>{{cite web | url        = http://www.maliciousdamage.biz/| title      = Malicious Damage| accessdate = 15 February 2008| publisher  = Malicious Damage}}</ref> [[Island Records]] distributed the records, until Malicious Damage switched to [[E.G. Records]] (then aligned with Virgin Records) in 1980. The songs on Killing Joke\'s early singles were primitive punk rock sometimes mixed with electronic ("Nervous System" and "Turn to Red"). \'\'Turn to Red\'\' came to the attention of legendary DJ [[John Peel]], who was keen to champion the band\'s urgent new sound and gave them extensive airplay. \'\'[[NME]]\'\' stated in a concert review that "their sound is a bit like early [[Siouxsie and the Banshees|[Siouxsie and the] Banshees]] without the thrilling, amoral imagination."<ref name="Lynn">{{cite work |first=Lynn |last=Hanna|title=Plague of the Punk Zombies |work=NME |page=45 |date=8 November 1980}}</ref> Concerning their performance, it was said that "the only animation on stage is provided by Jaz who crouches behind his synthesizer, making forays like a Neanderthal man gripped by a gesturing, giberring fury".<ref name="Lynn" /> They quickly progressed this sound into something denser, more aggressive, and more akin to [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]], as heard on their first two albums, \'\'[[Killing Joke (album)|Killing Joke]]\'\' (1980) and the more abrasive \'\'[[What\'s THIS For...!]]\'\' (1981). They toured extensively throughout the UK during this time, and both fans of [[post-punk]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] took interest in Killing Joke through singles such as "Follow the Leaders" (1981).<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

Killing Joke became notorious largely due to the controversies that arose from their imagery. Typically the images that appeared on their records and on-stage while performing live were bizarre and potentially shocking and inflammatory. One promotion poster featured an original photo, erroneously believed to be of [[Pope Pius XI]]. The picture was of German abbot [[Alban Schachleiter]] walking among rows of Nazi soldiers offering [[Hitler salute]]s and appearing to return the salute, and was later used for the cover of the band\'s compilation album \'\'[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]\'\'. Shortly afterwards, the band was banned from performing a concert in Glasgow, Scotland. The Candlelight Records bio of the band say that "far from being industry darlings" they had "run-ins" with various music journalists at the time.<ref>[http://www.candlelightrecords.co.uk/candleweb/redesign/killingjoke/new_site/killingjoke_biography.html The Complete Killing Joke Biography 1979-1982]. Candlelight Records. Retrieved 2014-09-03.</ref>

Killing Joke\'s third album, \'\'[[Revelations (Killing Joke)|Revelations]]\'\', produced by [[Conny Plank]], was released in 1982, and supported by a pair of performances on [[BBC Radio]]\'s \'\'The John Peel Show\'\' and by the singles "[[Chop-Chop]]", "[[Empire Song]]", and an unofficial release of "[[We Have Joy]]". The LP reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK Top albums.<ref name=lp/>

By 1982, members of Killing Joke, especially Coleman, had become immersed in the [[occult]], particularly the works of occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. In February of that year, Coleman, with Geordie and Youth following shortly after, moved to [[Iceland]] to survive the [[Apocalypse]], which Coleman predicted was coming soon. While in Iceland, Coleman and Geordie worked with musicians from the band [[\xc3\x9eeyr]] in the project [[Niceland (band)|Niceland]]. After a few months, Youth decided there was no indication of the Apocalypse, and decided to move back to England. Youth then began the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with Paul Ferguson, but the latter defected and travelled to Iceland to rejoin Killing Joke with new bassist [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]] (previously of [[Neon Hearts]] and the rock / glam band Kitsch) in tow. After spending some time in Iceland, Killing Joke returned to England and began touring and recording again.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The new line-up soon produced, again with Conny Plank, the single "Birds of a Feather / Sun Goes Down / Flock the B-Side" and \'\'[[Ha! (Killing Joke album)|Ha!]]\'\', a six-track 10" [[Extended play|EP]] of a live performance recorded live at Larry\'s Hideaway in Toronto in August.

===Shift towards a commercial sound (1983\xe2\x80\x931988)===
Killing Joke\'s fourth album, \'\'[[Fire Dances]]\'\' (1983), contained music that, like that heard on the "Birds of a Feather" single, was artier and relatively calmer than before, which began a new direction. This was continued with the non LP singles "Me or You" (1983, b/w "Wilful Days") and "A New Day" (1984, b/w a dance remix or dub mix of the same), the latter promoted with a music video.<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

Mixing their sound with a slightly pop style, and with Coleman singing and not growling, Killing Joke had developed a variation of [[New wave music|new wave]] on their fifth album, \'\'[[Night Time]]\'\' (1985). They achieved mainstream success with the single "[[Love Like Blood (song)|Love Like Blood]]" which covered all ground from [[goth]]<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/fun-games-killing-joke-in-the-mid-80s \'\'Fun & Games: Killing Joke in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9880s\'\'] by Adrien Begrand, [[PopMatters.com]]. \xc2\xab Punk, goth, New Wave, dance, pop, "Love Like Blood" covers all that ground with astonishing grace. \xc2\xbb</ref> to dance: it peaked at number 16 in the UK<ref name=single>{{cite web |title=uk singles charts - Killing Joke |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/killing%20joke/#singles |work=theofficialcharts.com |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> and number 8 in the Netherlands. \'\'Night Time\'\' also included the singles "Eighties" (1984) and "Kings and Queens" (1985), which both reached the UK Top 75. The album itself reached number 11 in the UK.<ref name=lp>{{cite web |title=UK albums charts - killing Joke |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/killing%20joke/#albums |work=theofficialcharts.com |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

The music on Killing Joke\'s sixth album, \'\'[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns (album)|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]]\'\' (1986), was mostly similar in sound and mood to "Love like Blood".  While no less aggressive and heavy than their older work, \'\'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\'\' diverged musically in ways that led to controversy among listeners. In this case, disagreements between fans and critics alike included opinions on whether the band was conforming with pressures from EG Records to develop a more commercial sound, to whether the songs were relevant for those listeners more comfortable with their proto post-punk beginnings. The record was a commercial failure compared to the previous effort: it didn\'t go in the top 50 in the UK charts.<ref name=lp/> However, two singles were released from the album - "Adorations" and "Sanity" - and the band continued touring successfully until the end of the year.<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

In 1987, the band started to work on a new album which was presented by Coleman and Geordie as a studio project to the rest of the band. Raven took part to the sessions but as he was unsatisfied by the result, he finally asked his name to be taken off the credits.<ref name="Mat">{{cite work |first=Mat |last=Smith |title=Killing Joke [Paul Raven interview] |work=Melody Maker |date=14 May 1988}}</ref> Ferguson recorded drums in Berlin but according to Coleman he was fired because he wasn\'t able to record the precise timings, a version that Raven later rejected.  "I know Paul and when he does something he does it properly. If it wasn\'t right he would have stayed there \'til it was."<ref name="Mat" /> Tensions ultimately led to both musicians being dismissed from the band. Session player [[Jimmy Copley]] was then brought in to provide the drumming on the songs, along with percussion player Jeff Scantlebury.

The resulting album, \'\'[[Outside the Gate]]\'\' (1988), is Killing Joke\'s most controversial album, due to its synth-led sonics and disagreement over the quality of the material. \'\'[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]\'\' said of the album: "It\'s a stodgy, inconclusive LP that fails in all but the most basic of senses to achieve its end, leaving us feeling soured and unimpressed."<ref>{{cite journal |author=King, Sam |title=The Joke Backfires [\'\'Outside The Gate\'\' review] |work=Sounds magazine |date=25 June 1988}}</ref> \'\'NME\'\' shared the same point of view and depicted it as "a private breakfast of ideas, depicting poor old Jaz wading through quicksand with his jeans rolled down yet again. Worse ... he seems to be wandering off in exactly the same direction."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ellen, Barbara |title=Thrilling Bloke |work=nme |date=23 July 1988 |quote=The latest album - \'Outside The Gate\'- carries on the new, less honed tradition.

Two singles, "America" and "My Love of This Land", were released from the album but did little to improve its fortunes, although the b-sides were live versions of old material. The video for the former features Coleman and Geordie with drummer [[Jimmy Copley]] and session bassist Jerome Rimson, who never actually recorded with the band.<ref>{{cite web

On 19 September 1987, Coleman had delivered a lecture at London\'s [[Courtauld Institute]] outlining the thinking behind the then-unreleased \'\'[[Outside the Gate]]\'\' album, touching on [[numerology]] and the occult. Geordie and percussionist Jeff Scantlebury provided a minimal musical backing at the event. A recording of the lecture was eventually released under the title \'\'[[The Courtauld Talks]]\'\' on Martin Atkins\' [[Invisible Records]] in 1989.

===Revised lineup and \'\'Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions\'\' (1989\xe2\x80\x931991)===
Towards the end of 1988, Coleman and Geordie decided to get Killing Joke up and running again as a live band, and they began looking for full-time bass players and drummers. First on board was drummer [[Martin Atkins]], who had gained notability in [[Public Image Ltd.]] and later [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Pigface]]. A suitable bass player proved more difficult. Former [[The Smiths|Smiths]] man [[Andy Rourke]] was hired, then dismissed after only three days. Eventually the band settled on Welsh bass player Dave "Taif" Ball, and played their first gigs in almost two years in December 1988.<ref>{{cite web| url        = http://www.taif.co.uk/taifbass/index.cfm?page=biog&more=6| title      = taif-bass: Killing Joke| accessdate = 15 December 2008| format     = CFM| publisher  = taif.co.uk}}</ref>  These featured the best of their 1980 to 1985 work, alongside powerful new material which alluded to the band\'s earlier, harsher sound. Nothing from \'\'Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\'\' or \'\'[[Outside the Gate]]\'\' was played (and indeed, never has been since). Touring continued across the UK, Europe and the US until August 1989, when the band took a break to record its new material in Germany, and to allow [[Jaz Coleman]] time to record \'\'[[Songs from the Victorious City]]\'\' with [[Anne Dudley]] of [[Art of Noise]], which was released the following year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

For reasons which remain unclear, the German Killing Joke sessions were shelved and bass player Taif left the band to be replaced by old hand [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]]. The revised line-up began recording again, this time in London, and the result was Killing Joke\'s eighth album, the ferocious \'\'[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]\'\', released on the German [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise International]] label in 1990. It included some of the heaviest, noisiest and harshest music ever to appear on a Killing Joke record, although the progressive musical spirit of the previous two albums remained as well. Songs included "Solitude", "Slipstream", "Age of Greed" and the single "Money Is Not Our God". Once again, the band toured Europe and North America, but by the middle of 1991 this promising new line-up had imploded. Coleman emigrated to New Zealand to live on a remote Pacific island.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Geordie, Martin Atkins, Ferguson, Raven and the band\'s live keyboard player [[John Bechdel]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]], [[Pigface]], [[Abstinence (band)|Abstinence]], False Icons, [[Ascension of the Watchers]]) added Scottish vocalist [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] ([[Finitribe]], [[Revolting Cocks]]) and continued as the short-lived [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder, Inc.]], releasing a self-titled album in 1992.

===Reunion with Youth and Butterfly era (1992\xe2\x80\x931996)===
[[File:Killing Joke-1994-Nottingham.jpg|thumb|Youth and Jaz (1994)]]
A Killing Joke anthology, \'\'[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]\'\', was released in 1992, and during its production, Geordie was re-acquainted with [[Martin Glover|Youth]], who suggested that they reform the band with himself back on bass. That same year, two singles (on cassette and CD) appeared featuring the early songs "Change" and "Wardance" in several new versions remixed by Youth, by then a very successful producer.

Coleman had produced the 1993 debut album \'\'[[Churn (Shihad album)|Churn]]\'\' by the New Zealand Band [[Shihad]] and Shihad drummer [[Tom Larkin]] played drums on some of the songs on \'\'Pandemonium\'\'. Relations later soured between Coleman and Shihad due to a dispute over Coleman\'s production fee for \'\'[[Churn (Shihad album)|Churn]]\'\', and the fact that Shihad considered him a  "megalomaniac". Shihad\'s second album, 1995\'s \'\'[[Killjoy (album)|Killjoy]]\'\', includes a song about Coleman and the dispute: \'Silvercup\'. Coleman has also made a number of disparaging remarks about [[Shihad]] in the media. Shihad singer and guitarist [[Jon Toogood]] says his band have since put the dispute behind them.

Killing Joke also sued [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] during this phase, alleging that the riff for the latter\'s song "[[Come As You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]" was copied from the riff for their song "[[Eighties (song)|Eighties]]".<ref name="anikerrang" /><ref name="Borzillo-Vrenna-Nirvana_Pay_Back_Killing_Joke" />  The lawsuit was dropped after the suicide of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref name="bbc">{{cite web

The reactivated Killing Joke released two strong and well-received albums on Youth\'s [[Butterfly Recordings]] label, \'\'[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]\'\' and \'\'[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]\'\', which saw the band shift back to the simpler arrangements of their early albums whilst also (on 12 inch remixes) employ young talent, the likes of Waxworth Industries in order to provide an alternative inroad to the band\'s new and evolving sound. \'\'[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]\'\' (1994) wove a metallesque ritualistic sound with mosh beats and loops and provided Killing Joke with a memorable [[Top of the Pops]] performance for the single \'Millennium\', which was a UK Top 40 hit (the album itself made the Top 20). The title track was also released as a single and made the UK Top 30. \'\'Democracy\'\' (1996) successfully introduced acoustic guitar into the mix, as well as adopting more of a "live band" sound again. The title track was again released as a single and made the UK Top 40. Much of \'\'Pandemonium\'\' and all of \'\'Democracy\'\' featured session drummer Geoff Dugmore. He also played live with the band throughout this era. [[Nick Holywell-Walker]] joined the band on keyboards and programming for 11 years from 1994 to 2005, notably on \'\'[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]\'\' and \'\'XXV Gathering\'\'. Youth bowed out of live performance early in the \'\'Democracy\'\' tour and was replaced by [[Troy Gregory]], ex [[Prong (band)|Prong]].<ref name="Hightower-Volume_30" />

After the \'\'Democracy\'\' tour, the band went on an extended hiatus. Jaz Coleman and Youth produced a string of well-received orchestral rock albums based on the music of legends such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[The Doors]]. Coleman became Composer-in-Residence for New Zealand and Czech symphony orchestras.<ref name="decibelmagazine.com-Killing_Joke">{{cite web

===Reformation, next two albums and death of Paul Raven (2002\xe2\x80\x932007)===
Coleman, Geordie and Youth reformed Killing Joke in 2002, and recorded their [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|second self-titled album]]. Produced by [[Andy Gill]] and released to much acclaim in 2003 on the Zuma/Sony label, it was heralded as a powerful addition to \'\'Extremities\'\' and other visceral 1990s albums, and considered one of their finest recordings. In 2003 the band played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe (400,000 - 500,000 rock fans every year) - [[Przystanek Woodstock]]<ref name="wosp">{{cite web|url=http://www.en.wosp.org.pl/woodstock/|title=Home - Wielka Orkiestra \xc5\x9awi\xc4\x85tecznej PomocyP|publisher=en.wosp.org.pl|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> in Poland. The [[War on Terror]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]] were cited as major factors in their reforming, and this is reflected in the lyrical content of much of the album, based on themes of war, government control and [[Armageddon]]. The album, which fell just short of the UK Top 40, was their heaviest to date and spawned two singles, "Loose Cannon" (a UK Top 25 hit) and "Seeing Red". The songs are all credited to Coleman/Walker/[[Martin Glover|Glover]]/Gill, although [[Paul Raven (musician)|Raven]]\'s name is also on the list of musicians on the liner notes, marking his return to the band after more than a decade. The album was accompanied by a tour of the United States, Europe and Australia in 2003/2004, with ex-[[Prong (band)|Prong]] drummer [[Ted Parsons]] on board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In February 2005, now with young Twin Zero and [[Sack Trick]] drummer Ben Calvert, Killing Joke played two consecutive shows at London\'s [[Shepherds Bush Empire]] to commemorate their 25th anniversary. DVD and CD recordings from these concerts were released in on [[Cooking Vinyl]] in the fall of 2005 as \'\'XXV Gathering: The Band That Preys Together Stays Together\'\'.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In June 2005, remastered and expanded editions of their two 1990s [[Butterfly Recordings]] albums, \'\'Pandemonium\'\' and \'\'Democracy\'\', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by their first four albums (\'\'Killing Joke\'\' to \'\'Ha!\'\') on [[EMI]], who by then owned the [[E.G. Records]] catalogue. The second batch of EMI remasters would not appear until January 2008.)

In mid-2005, Frontman from Industrial band, INERTIA, Reza Udhin, joins the band on Keyboards and they supported the British leg of [[M\xc3\xb6tley Cr\xc3\xbce]]\'s world tour and then began work on their next album in [[Prague]]. It was at this time the contribution to the world of rock was recognised when they were awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2005 Kerrang Awards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Opting for simplicity and raw energy, the band recorded the new album in "Hell", the basement rehearsal space of Studio Faust Records in Prague, going for live takes with the minimum of overdubs. The result was \'\'[[Hosannas from the Basements of Hell]]\'\', released in April 2006 on Cooking Vinyl, which made the UK Top 75.

Killing Joke began a European tour in support of the album in April 2006. Bass player [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]] abruptly departed after a few dates to tour with [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and was temporarily replaced by [[Kneill Brown]]. The tour included an appearance headlining the [[MySpace]] stage of the Download Festival on 10 June 2006, which received four K\'s from \'\'[[Kerrang!]]\'\' magazine. Other highlights of the summer included a memorable set in Japan at the Fuji Rock festival where there were joined on stage by [[The Orb|Orb]] frontman [[Alex Paterson]] (once a Killing Joke drum roadie) and headlining the Beautiful Days festival in the UK. The band\'s momentum suffered another blow, when health problems caused the autumn leg of the tour to be cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

\'\'\'Machines of Loving Grace\'\'\' was an [[industrial rock]] band from Tucson, Arizona. 

==History==

===Formation===
Named for a [[Richard Brautigan]] poem, they formed in 1989. The original lineup consisted of [[Scott Benzel]] ([[Singing|vocals]]), Stuart Kupers ([[guitar]] and [[bass guitar|bass]]), and Mike Fisher ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), with Brad Kemp ([[Drum kit|drums]]) added shortly thereafter. They recorded a demo and were picked up by [[Carrboro, North Carolina]]-based [[Mammoth Records]] in 1991. The band was unable to re-record their material for their eponymous debut album, as the label released their demo as it was recorded.

===\'\'Concentration\'\'===
Two years later, the band released \'\'[[Concentration (album)|Concentration]].\'\' It continued their signature sound, but was more refined in the combination of beat- and bass-heavy riffs, with hard edged guitar. With the release of two videos, the band was able to get national-level [[MTV]] airplay, and join in the industrial rock wave that was ushered in by [[Nine Inch Nails]]. 

In 1994 they recorded a new song, "Golgotha Tenement Blues", for the [[The Crow (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the film \'\'[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]\'\'.

===\'\'Gilt\'\'===
In 1995, Machines of Loving Grace released their third album, \'\'[[Gilt (album)|Gilt]]\'\'.  This record was marked by an increased guitar presence. New band members included David Suycott (formerly of [[Stabbing Westward]] and [[Spies Who Surf]]) on [[Drum kit|drums]], Ray Riendeau ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and Tom Coffeen ([[guitar]]). A remix of the song "Richest Junkie Still Alive" was included on the soundtrack to \'\'[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]\'\'. The song, "Tryst" was released on the ill-fated "MegaMan Soundtrack". Furthermore, various mixes of three of their songs\xe2\x80\x94"Perfect Tan", "Butterfly Wings", and "Lilith/Eve"\xe2\x80\x94were featured on the \'95 horror [[Devour (film)|Devour]]. "Butterfly Wings" was also featured on the television show [[Due South]], in the episodes Chicago Holiday and Flashback.

===Break up\xe2\x80\x93present===
As of 1997, the band was working on a new record, but before it was completed the band broke up. This was precipitated by trouble at the label, and Benzel\'s desire to work on other projects, among other reasons.  A new album was to be called \'\'Love Scenes at the Slave Market\'\', but after a fruitless search for a [[Record label|label]] (Mammoth was in the process of being sold), the project was abandoned. 

As of 2006, Benzel is involved with an electronic band, called [[Soulo]]. Mike Fisher is currently with Amish Rake Fight.

In 2008, "Butterfly Wings" from 1993\'s \'\'[[Concentration (album)|Concentration]]\'\' was featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture \'\'[[Punisher: War Zone]]\'\'.

\'\'\'The Mad Capsule Markets\'\'\' (originally known as \'\'\'The Mad Capsule Market\'s\'\'\' and \'\'\'Berrie\'\'\') were a [[Japan]]ese band that formed in 1990 and were active until 2006. The band became known for their experimental style, which melded various kinds of [[electronic music]]  and [[punk rock]].

==Biography==
===Berrie (1985-1990)===
In 1985, while in high school, vocalist and songwriter [[Hiroshi Kyono]] and guitarist [[Minoru Kojima]] formed the [[punk rock|punk]] band Berrie. One year later, the duo were joined by bassist [[Takeshi Ueda]] and drummer "Seto", at which point the quartet began performing at concerts and entering [[Battle of the Bands]] competitions. The band recorded a three-song demo tape entitled \'\'Poison Revolution\'\', which they distributed themselves. (Two of these three songs were later re-released on the \'\'[[Speak!!!]]\'\' album.) Their popularity in the Japanese [[underground music]] scene steadily grew and in 1990 this success earned them a place as the opening act for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. However, within months of the performance, drummer "Seto" left the band, and was replaced by [[Tokyo]] resident [[Motokatsu Miyagami]]. In April 1990, Berrie changed its name to \'\'\'The Mad Capsule Market\'s\'\'\', purportedly a term for distributors of [[Betaphenethylamine]], a fictional drug from the [[cyberpunk]] novel \'\'[[Neuromancer]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.zombiezodiac.com/rob/mad/archive/pill_box/this_site.html] taken from The Crazy Pill Bazaars website, URL last accessed 3-15-07</ref>

===Early years (1990-1996)===
In August 1990, the new band released their first single, "Government Wall", a re-recording of the Berrie song. In October, they released their debut album, \'\'[[Humanity (The Mad Capsule Markets album)|Humanity]]\'\', which also featured a number of Berrie songs and retained their punk sound. After the album\'s release, original guitarist Minoru Kojima left the band, and was replaced by former roadie [[Ai Ishigaki]]. The following year, The Mad Capsule Markets signed to major record label [[Victor Entertainment]] and recorded their second album, \'\'[[P.O.P]]\'\'. A faster and harder album than their first, it was heavily censored, provoking outrage from the band members. Their earlier lyrical content, with the lyrics wrote mostly by bassist  Takeshi Ueda had Marxist/working-class influences, with lyrical themes becoming more and more political with later releases. from 1990 their sound  was  mainly punk influenced but quickly began to incorporate different influences in their music by the likes of [[Killing Joke]], [[Aburadako]], [[The Stalin]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].

From 1992 onwards the band began to experiment with their sound, introducing various [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] machines and [[New wave music|New Wave]] sounds. In 1992 they recorded the [[extended play|EP]] \'\'[[Capsule Soup]]\'\' and their third album \'\'[[Speak!!!]]\'\'. In 1993, their fourth album \'\'[[Mix-ism]]\'\' leaned more towards [[ska]], and in 1994 their fifth album \'\'[[Park (album)|Park]]\'\' demonstrated a slower and more melodic style. This was also the first album to be released overseas (in the [[United States]], although almost two years after its Japanese release). 

Recorded and produced in the USA, their 1996 album \'\'[[4 Plugs]]\'\' saw a musical shift towards [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Although the band retained its style of rock with electronic influences, the music was darker and heavier. Vocalist Kyono also altered his singing style and began [[rapping]] in [[English language|English]] occasionally. This marked the beginning of the major stylistic change that would be demonstrated on subsequent recordings.

Later that year, the band released a self-titled [[greatest hits]] compilation, containing re-recorded songs from their career up to that point. Following its release, guitarist Ai Ishigaki left the band and was replaced by "[[TORUxxx]]".

===Stylistic change and international recognition (1997\xe2\x80\x932005)===
Perhaps boosted by the change in guitarist, The Mad Capsule Markets\' sound became heavier still. In 1997 they released their second international album and eighth overall, \'\'[[Digidogheadlock]]\'\'. A strong progression from \'\'4 Plugs\'\', [[electronica]] came to the forefront and the music had a great deal in common with [[industrial metal]].

In 1999 the band released their most internationally recognized album to date. \'\'[[Osc-Dis]] (Oscillator in Distortion)\'\' was a more [[pop rock|poppy]] or melodic take on the sound of \'\'Digidogheadlock\'\'. It was released worldwide in 2001, driven by the hugely popular single "Pulse", which featured on the video game \'\'[[Tony Hawk\'s Pro Skater 3]]\'\'. The song and the album became the group\'s most well-known outside of Japan. At this time the band also introduced their robotic "[[mascot]]s" the White Crusher and Black Cyborn.

The Mad Capsule Markets\' tenth album, \'\'010\'\', was released in 2001 and demonstrated all the styles that they had explored previously, with a stronger emphasis on electronica. This produced a record which sounded more diverse than those before it. In 2002 the band also released a live album entitled \'\'[[020120]]\'\', after the date of the performance.

In 2004 the band produced their most recent studio album, \'\'[[Cistm Konfliqt...]]\'\' (pronounced "System Conflict"). The album was a return to the heaviness of \'\'Digidogheadlock\'\', but this heaviness was filtered through the electronic experimentation of the previous two albums, maintaining a strong link with [[digital hardcore]]. The [[United Kingdom|UK]] release of \'\'Cistm Konfliqt...\'\' in 2005 saw the band\'s popularity there grow, with rock magazine \'\'[[Kerrang!]]\'\' inviting them to play numerous concerts. [[Japan]]ese [[mixed martial arts]] fighter [[Takanori Gomi]] uses the track "Scary" for his entrance theme. 

In 2005, The Mad Capsule Markets broke from longtime record label [[Victor Entertainment|Victor/Invitation]] and signed to [[Sony Music Japan]]. They released two greatest hits compilations of songs spanning their entire career, these were entitled \'\'1990-1996\'\' and \'\'1997-2004\'\'.

On 5 April the band announced that they were taking an \'extended break\' from making music under the Mad Capsule Markets\' name and instead work on separate projects. They posted this on the official Japanese site: 

"Thank you so much for big support for us. This time, after our discuss with 3 guys from the band, we decide to take an {{sic|entended}} break as the band. We can\'t decide when we can re-start again as the band, at this point. Each from the band plans to work as {{sic|indivisual}} artist/projects, please keep supporting us from now on. thank you."

\'\'\'MDFMK\'\'\' was an [[industrial rock]] band formed by two members of [[KMFDM]], [[Sascha Konietzko]] and [[Tim Sk\xc3\xb6ld]]. [[Lucia Cifarelli]], formerly of the band [[Drill (band)|Drill]], later rounded out the trio.

==History==
Due to differences between some of KMFDM\'s band members about the band\'s future, KMFDM disbanded in 1999.  Sascha Konietzko and Skold continued working together under the name MDFMK. They released just one album: \'\'[[MDFMK (album)|MDFMK]]\'\'<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/discography/sideprojects.htm | title=KMFDM Side Projects | work=KMFDM.net | publisher=KMFDM Enterprises | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> (2000, Universal Records). The band, with [[Lucia Cifarelli]] (formerly of the band [[Drill (band)|Drill]]), took on a more futuristic sound, which also contained hints of trance and europop, primarily in the style of production, leaning towards what is now commonly referred to as \'electronica\'. MDFMK featured all three sharing vocal duties. Their song "Missing Time" was used in the animated movie, \'\'[[Heavy Metal 2000]]\'\'.  The band toured the United States and Canada in 2000,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/871608/mdfmk-rock-us.jhtml | author=Moss, Corey | title=MDFMK Prepare For Sonic Assault Of U.S. | publisher=[[MTV Networks]] | date=May 4, 2000 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref> during which it had a fourth member, a giant robot guitarist named Zyclor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lostinasupermarket.com/2009/05/kmfdm/ | title=Lost in a Supermarket: KMFDM Interview | accessdate=February 23, 2010}}</ref>  Konietzko stated in 2003 that there was material for what he called "MDFMK #2", but that [[Universal Records]] was "sitting on it".<ref name=mk>{{cite web | url=http://www.mk-magazine.com/interviews/archives/000123.php | author=Curry, Chris | title=MK Magazine Interviews: KMFDM | work=MK Magazine | date=November 1, 2003 | accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>  He also said that if Universal never released the material, he would eventually get the rights to it and release it himself.<ref name=mk/>

\'\'\'Ministry\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[industrial metal]] band founded by lead singer [[Al Jourgensen]] in 1981. Originally a [[New wave music|new wave]] [[synthpop]] outfit, Ministry changed its style to industrial metal in the mid-1980s. Ministry found mainstream success in the early 1990s with its most successful album \'\'[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]\'\' (1992) and touring as part of the [[Lollapalooza]] festival.

After 27 years of performing, Jourgensen decided to end the band in 2008, saying a reunion would never happen. However, in August 2011, a reunion was announced, when Ministry confirmed they would play one of their first shows in four years at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in August 2012.<ref name="reunion">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=161658|title=Ministry Is Back! 2012 Wacken Open Air Festival Appearance Confirmed|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=7 August 2011|accessdate=7 August 2011}}</ref> Ministry released a new album, \'\'[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]\'\', on March 23, 2012, which was followed by a [[Relapse Tour|world tour]].<ref name="relapse">{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteenthplanet.com/ministry/ministry_blog.html|title=Ministry relapse coming 2012 |publisher=thirteenthplanet.com|accessdate=25 September 2011}}</ref> Following the death of long time guitarist [[Mike Scaccia]], Ministry released their final album \'\'[[From Beer to Eternity]]\'\' in September 2013, but still plan to tour in support of that album.

==Band history==

===Early years and \'\'With Sympathy\'\' (1981\xe2\x80\x931984)===
Al Jourgensen began Ministry in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1981. His first band prior to Ministry was Special Affect with Groovie Mann (of [[My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult]]), drummer Harry Rushakoff ([[Concrete Blonde]]) and bassist Marty Sorenson. After that was the short-lived Silly Charmichaels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://punkdatabase.com/wiki/Silly_Carmichaels |title=Silly Carmichaels \xe2\x80\x93 ChicagoPunk |publisher=Punkdatabase.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> with Ben Krug,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prongs.org/ministry/Krug1 |title=Interview with Ben Krug regarding the Silly Charmichaels |publisher=Prongs.org |date=2006-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> Tom Krug and Tom Wall (all of [[The Imports]]).

The original line-up of Ministry consisted mainly of Jourgensen (vocals and guitar), [[Stephen George]] (drums), Robert Roberts (keyboards), and John Davis (keyboards), although with a few personnel changes, the band\'s image would begin to focus more on Jourgensen and Stephen George. Ministry\'s original sound was essentially [[New wave music|new wave]] [[synthpop]] that was more melodic and stylized than the aggressive music for which they would become known. Ministry released four 12" singles on [[Wax Trax! Records]] from 1981 to 1984 (anthologized on \'\'[[Twelve Inch Singles (1981\xe2\x80\x931984)]]\'\' that featured the club favorite "[[Everyday Is Halloween]]").

Their first LP \'\'[[With Sympathy]]\'\', was issued on Arista Records in 1983 and hit the upper 90s in the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]]. The LP was well received by college radio fans initially and became common in many new wave album collections at the time. The music in \'\'[[With Sympathy]]\'\' and the singles Arista issued in association with it were a melodic type of synthpop and part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] sound growing in popularity in the early 1980s. Songs from the LP were played live as an opening act for [[The Police]] during the Synchronicity Tour\'s North American leg, the band was well received by the large arena audiences. Jourgensen has expressed disappointment with some of Ministry\'s recordings during those early years. According to him, after signing the record contract, all artistic control of Ministry was "handed" over to other writers and producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/jourgensen-i.htm |title=Alain Jourgensen interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> Some of his preferred recordings from that era were collected into the CD \'\'[[Early Trax]]\'\' ([[Rykodisc Records]], 2004).

===\'\'Twitch\'\' (1985\xe2\x80\x931986)===
By the mid-1980s, Jourgensen parted ways with George and signed to [[Sire Records]]. Jourgensen performed mostly solo for Ministry\'s next LP, \'\'[[Twitch (Ministry album)|Twitch]]\'\' (1986), which sold well, but was still considered to be "underground". The music was danceable electronic music, but wasn\'t pop music, and the sound was harsher and more aggressive than what Ministry had recorded before. According to Jourgensen, "\'\'Twitch\'\' was stuff that I was doing before \'\'With Sympathy\'\' came out. Some of that stuff was already four or five years old, but the record company didn\'t want to use it, so...".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/jourgensen-i.htm |title=Mark Prindle interview: Alain Jourgensen (2004) |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> Much of the new sound was created with the use of [[Sampling (music)|digital sampling]] and the input of producer [[Adrian Sherwood]].

===\'\'The Land of Rape and Honey\'\' (1987\xe2\x80\x931988)===
After \'\'Twitch\'\', Jourgensen made the most significant change in Ministry\'s history when he became re-enchanted with the electric guitar. Jourgensen also brought bass guitarist [[Paul Barker]] of the Seattle band [[The Blackouts]] into the Ministry camp; Barker would remain Jourgensen\'s bandmate for many years when he was the only person credited as a member of the band other than Jourgensen. With the addition of The Blackouts drummer [[William Rieflin]], Ministry recorded \'\'[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]\'\' (1988). The LP continued their success in the underground music scene. \'\'The Land of Rape and Honey\'\' made use of synthesizers, keyboards, tape loops, jackhammering drum machines, dialogue excerpted from movies, unconventional electronic processing, and, in parts, heavy distorted electric guitar and bass.

The album was supported by a tour in 1988 and the singles and music videos for "[[Stigmata (song)|Stigmata]]" and "[[Flashback (Ministry song)|Flashback]]". Stigmata was also used in a key scene in Richard Stanley\'s 1990 film \'\'[[Hardware (film)|Hardware]]\'\', although the band shown performing the song was [[Gwar]].

===\'\'The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste\'\' (1989\xe2\x80\x931990)===
The follow-up, \'\'[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]\'\' was supported by a tour from 1989 to 1990. Due to the complex nature of the album\'s drumming, a second drummer, [[Martin Atkins]], was used. In addition to Atkins, a ten piece touring line-up was formed, consisting of [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] (keyboards and vocals), [[Nivek Ogre]] (vocals and keyboards), Joe Kelly (vocals and backing vocals) and guitarists [[Mike Scaccia]], [[Discharge (band)|Terry Roberts]], and [[William Tucker (musician)|William Tucker]], with Jourgensen, Barker and Rieflin serving as the groups core members. This tour was documented on \'\'[[In Case You Didn\'t Feel Like Showing Up]]\'\'. Three singles, Thieves, "[[Burning Inside (song)|Burning Inside]]" (for which a video was made), and So What where released from the album.

Throughout the late 1980s Jourgensen and Barker expanded their ideas beyond Ministry into a seemingly endless parade of side projects and collaborations. Many of these bore Ministry\'s signature sound and the duo\'s "Hypo Luxa/Hermes Pan" production imprint. (These side-projects were also responsible for the delayed release of Ministry\'s next album.) Foremost of these was Ministry\'s alter ego, the [[Revolting Cocks]]. "RevCo", as it is often referred to, essentially became the same band as it had originally featured Belgian musicians [[Richard 23]] (of [[Front 242]]) and [[Luc Van Acker]]. Jourgensen and Barker also formed [[Lard (band)|Lard]] with [[Dead Kennedys]] lead singer [[Jello Biafra]], [[Acid Horse]] with [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[1000 Homo DJs]] (which featured [[Nine Inch Nails]]\' [[Trent Reznor]] doing vocals on a cover of [[Black Sabbath]]\'s \'\'Supernaut\'\'), [[PTP (band)|PTP]] with [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] and [[Pailhead]] with [[Ian MacKaye]] of [[Minor Threat]] and [[Fugazi]].

Barker released his own material as [[Lead into Gold]] and Jourgensen produced and played electric guitar on [[Skinny Puppy]]\'s \'\'Rabies\'\' LP. Atkins and Rieflin also formed the band [[Pigface]], which featured Barker on several tracks, as well. The smaller of these projects were later collected on the CD \'\'[[Side Trax]]\'\' (Rykodisc Records, 2004), and the RevCo discography was remastered and reissued.

===\'\'Psalm 69\'\' (1991\xe2\x80\x931993)===
Ministry broke into the mainstream in 1991 with "[[Jesus Built My Hotrod]]" (co-authored by [[Gibby Haynes]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] and Michael Balch of [[Frontline Assembly]] affiliation). The [[music video]] was a hit, and the band scored second billing on the Lollapalooza tour and managed, by some accounts, to steal the show. As the single would have indicated, the sound of the following LP, \'\'[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs]]\'\' (1992), was the most metal-oriented Ministry had put to record at that point, the focal point of the sound shifting almost entirely from synths to Jourgensen\'s and new members [[Mike Scaccia]]\'s and [[Louis Svitek]]\'s electric guitars.

\'\'\'\xce\x9a\xce\x95\xce\xa6\xce\x91\xce\x9b\xce\x97\xce\x9e\xce\x98\'\'\', which is printed on the record, is a [[concatenation]] of "\xce\xba\xce\xb5\xcf\x86\xce\xb1\xce\xbb\xce\xae" ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "head" or "leader") and "\xce\x9e\xce\x98" (the number 69 in [[Greek numerals]]). The title was borrowed from [[Aleister Crowley]]\'s work: [[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|The Book of Lies]] (Chapter 69, "The Way to Succeed\xe2\x80\x94and the Way to Suck Eggs!"). \'\'Psalm 69\'\' became Ministry\'s biggest hit, including in addition to "Jesus Built My Hotrod", the singles "N.W.O." (a protest of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and attack directed at then-[[George H. W. Bush|President George H.W. Bush]]) and "Just One Fix" (a collaboration with poet/novelist [[William S. Burroughs]]). The single "N.W.O." was used in the 1992 live-action/animated movie \'\'[[Cool World]]\'\'. Later, NWO was used in \'\'Need For Speed - The Run\'\' video game.

===\'\'Filth Pig\'\' (1994\xe2\x80\x931996)===
In 1994, Ministry performed at the [[Bridge School Benefit]] [[charity concert]], covering songs by [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ten Years After]], and [[The Grateful Dead]], and playing a new song, "Paisley", which was intended to be on their next album. In 1995, Ministry was one of the headlining acts for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]\'s [[Big Day Out]] touring festival. In spite of their growing success, Ministry was nearly derailed by a series of arrests and drug problems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The band did not issue their next album, \'\'[[Filth Pig]]\'\', until 1996. For \'\'Filth Pig\'\', Ministry stripped all synthesizers and most samples from their style and made the music almost entirely with ultra-noisy guitars, heavy bass, and real drums.

The songs were played mostly at slower tempos than the very fast ones that were used for the compositions on their previous three LPs, giving it an almost [[doom metal]] feel. \'\'Filth Pig\'\' was supported with the singles/videos "[[Reload (Ministry song)|Reload]]", "[[The Fall (Ministry song)|The Fall]]", "[[Lay Lady Lay]]" (an unusual and unexpected cover of Bob Dylan\'s old [[country and western|country]]-tinged hit) and "Brick Windows" and with a tour in 1996 (the live performances were later anthologized on the \'\'[[Sphinctour]]\'\' album and DVD in 2002). The album has been considered by Jourgensen to be his response to fan expectations of where Ministry\'s sound was heading.

===\'\'Dark Side of the Spoon\'\' (1998\xe2\x80\x932000)===
Ministry recorded their final studio album for Warner Bros. Records, \'\'[[Dark Side of the Spoon]]\'\' (1999), which they dedicated to William Tucker, who committed suicide earlier that year. For \'\'Dark Side of the Spoon\'\', Ministry tried to diversify their sound by adding some melodic and synthetic touches, to their usual electro-metal sound, along with some jazz influences, but the album was not well received. However, the single "[[Bad Blood (Ministry song)|Bad Blood]]" appeared on the [[The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack album of \'\'The Matrix\'\']] and was nominated for a 2000 Grammy award.

In the summer of 2000, Ministry was invited to that year\'s [[Ozzfest]]. They would fill in the co-headliner position left vacant by a failed-reuniting of the original [[Judas Priest]]. Ministry was later dropped from the bill after a management changeover. They were replaced by [[Soulfly]].

===Hiatus and \'\'Animositisomina\'\' (2001\xe2\x80\x932003)===
After Ministry parted ways with their longtime record label Warner Bros. Records, the label issued the collection \'\'Greatest Fits\'\' in 2001, which featured a new song, "What About Us?". Ministry would later perform the song in a cameo appearance in the Steven Spielberg film \'\'[[AI: Artificial Intelligence]]\'\'. During the years 2000-2002, disputes with Warner Bros. Records resulted in the planned albums \'\'Live Psalm 69\'\', \'\'Sphinctour\'\' and \'\'ClittourUS\'\' on [[Ipecac Recordings]] being canceled.\'\'Sphinctour\'\' was released on [[Sanctuary Records]].

Around 2001, Jourgensen almost lost his arm when he was bitten by a venomous spider, but, refusing to stay in the hospital, he lost his big toe instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/jourgensens%20heroin%20wake-up%20call |title=Ministry - Jourgensen\'s Heroin Wake-Up Call - Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> According to Jourgensen, the realization that he could have lost his livelihood caused him to kick his heroin addiction and focus on music once again. Jourgensen and Barker, along with [[Max Brody]] who had joined as a saxophone player for the 1999 tour, focused on developing songs for a new record during 2001 and 2002, with the band issuing \'\'[[Animositisomina]]\'\' on Sanctuary Records in 2003. The sound was strongly heavy metal laden with voice effects, and matched the ferocity of \'\'Psalm 69\'\' (though it featured an almost-pop cover of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]\'s "The Light Pours Out Of Me"). \'\'Animositisomina\'\' did poorly in terms of sales and singles for "Animosity" and "Piss" were canceled before they could be released.

Barker left the Ministry camp in 2003. He stated that the trigger was his father dying while the band was wrapping up a summer tour in Europe, and also stated in early 2004 that his family life was his main focus at that particular time. Jourgensen continued Ministry with Mike Scaccia and various other musicians.

===\'\'Houses of the Mol\xc3\xa9\'\' and \'\'Rio Grande Blood\'\' (2004\xe2\x80\x932006)===
[[File:Ministry, Mera Luna 2006.JPG|thumb|A 2006 show at Mera Luna]]
For Ministry\'s next album, Jourgensen released the song "[[No W]]", an attack on then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]; an alternate version of the track was placed on the multi-performer compilation \'\'[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1]]\'\'. The follow-up LP, \'\'[[Houses of the Mol\xc3\xa9]]\'\' (2004), contained the most explicitly political lyrics Jourgensen had yet written, with songs in Ministry\'s classic [[Industrial music|industrial]] electro-metallic sound played messier, more crudely and more freely than ever before, giving the album the most metal-oriented sound of their career. In 2006 the band released \'\'[[Rio Grande Blood]]\'\', an LP on Jourgensen\'s own [[13th Planet Records]]. With [[Prong (band)|Prong]]\'s [[Tommy Victor]] and [[Killing Joke]]\'s [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]], the album featured an even heavier thrash metal sound drawing comparison to [[Slayer]]. 
The single "Lieslieslies" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. It, along with another song on the album, "The Great Satan", is also available as a [[downloadable content]] song for the 2008 video game [[Rock Band 2]]. In July 2007, the band released \'\'[[Rio Grande Dub]]\'\', an album featuring remixes from the band\'s 2006 \'\'[[Rio Grande Blood]]\'\' album.

===\'\'The Last Sucker\'\', \'\'Cover Up\'\' and \'\'Undercover\'\' (2007\xe2\x80\x932010)===
Ministry\'s "final" album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58299/ministry-plots-final-disc|publisher=Billboard|author=[[Gary Graff]]|title=Ministry Plots Final Disc|date=May 26, 2006|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> \'\'[[The Last Sucker]]\'\', was released on September 18, 2007.

On June 4, 2007, Al Jourgensen filed a [[Tortious interference|Tortious Interference]] lawsuit against ex-bassist [[Paul Barker]] and Spurburn Music in Los Angeles Superior Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/CivilCaseSummary/main.asp?Referer=Index |title=Los Angeles Superior Court - Civil Case Summary |publisher=Lasuperiorcourt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> (case #SC094122) The case was dismissed on October 24, 2008.

[[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]] died on October 20, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26593_0_2_0_C |title=Paul Raven - Bass player with Killing Joke, Ministry, Prong Dies in Geneva Aged 46 (Jan 16th 1961) |publisher=Side-line.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> He suffered an apparent heart attack shortly after arriving in Europe to commence recording for the French industrial band [[Treponem Pal]] near the Swiss border.

Al Jourgensen remixed and co-produced Spyder Baby\'s "Bitter", which was released by Blind Prophecy Records in early 2008.

A song titled "[[Keys to the City (song)|Keys to the City]]", the theme song for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] was released on March 5, 2008. In addition to this single, two albums of covers/remixes, \'\'[[Cover Up (Ministry album)|Cover Up]]\'\' (April 1, 2008) and \'\'[[Undercover (Ministry album)|Undercover]]\'\' (December 7, 2010) were released. All of these releases are credited to \'\'\'Ministry and Co-Conspirators\'\'\', since they feature [[collaboration]]s between Al Jourgensen and other musicians.

Ministry\'s farewell tour, the "C-U-LaTour", started its North American leg on March 26, 2008 with [[Meshuggah]] performing as special guests and [[Hemlock (band)|Hemlock]] as an opening act. They played their final North American show in Chicago on 12 May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/blog/the_overdue_demise_of_ministry |title=The Overdue Demise of Ministry |publisher=Avclub.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> The final date on their farewell tour was at the Tripod in Dublin, Ireland on 18 July 2008. During the performance, Jourgensen repeatedly reaffirmed it would indeed be the last ever Ministry show. Due to a large demand for tickets, an extra gig was added at the Tripod on 19 July 2008. The band again played to a full house. Ministry\'s final song at this show (and ostensibly their last ever live performance) was a rendition of their cover version of "[[What a Wonderful World]]"<ref>[ [TRANSLATED] Ministry - Wonderful World part 2 - Dublin 19.07.2008]</ref> to the music of "Jesus built my Hot-Rod".

\'\'[[Adios... Puta Madres]]\'\', a live album featuring material culled from Ministry\'s final tour, was released in 2009 on CD and DVD.<ref name="Al Jourgensen: Sex-O Olympic-O">{{cite web

Three of the group\'s songs were featured in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 2009 film \'\'[[The Hurt Locker]]\'\'.

A [[documentary film]] called \'\'[[Fix: The Ministry Movie]]\'\' (original title: Fix) was planned for release sometime in 2010. However, the release date was pushed back to early 2011. The documentary premiered at the Chicago International Movies & Music Festival. Jourgensen sued the maker, Doug Freel, for failing to fulfill his part of the contract (giving Jourgensen approval over the final cut, along with "thousands of dollars").<ref>{{cite web|first=Gina |last=McIntyre |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/ministry-frontman-al-jourgensen-sues-makers-of-behind-the-scenes-documentary-fix-.html |title=Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen sues makers of behind-the-scenes documentary \'Fix\' |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>  The lawsuit was dropped in July 2011.

===Reunion, \'\'Relapse\'\' and \'\'From Beer to Eternity\'\' (2011\xe2\x80\x93present)===
On August 7, 2011, it was announced that Ministry was reforming and would play at Germany\'s [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, set to take place August 2\xe2\x80\x934, 2012.<ref name="reunion"/> The reunion lineup featured [[Al Jourgensen]] on vocals, [[Mike Scaccia]] and [[Tommy Victor]] both on guitar, [[Aaron Rossi]] on drums, [[John Bechdel]] on keyboards and [[Tony Campos]] on bass.<ref name="Jourgensen interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162138|title=Al Jourgensen: Why I Decided To Bring Back Ministry|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

Jourgensen told Metal Hammer in August 2011 that Ministry was working on a new album called \'\'[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]\'\', which they hoped to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, "We\'ve only got five songs to go. I\'ve been listening to it the last couple of weeks and I wasn\'t really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [Mikey\'s] raving about it. It\'s like, dude c\'mon, this is not about Bush, so\xe2\x80\xa6 that part\'s over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it\'s time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I\'ve ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I\'ve done in a long time, faster than Mikey\'s done in a long time. He just did a [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]] tour and said it was easy compared to this Ministry stuff so it\'s gonna be brutal and it\'s gonna freak a lot of people out."<ref name="Jourgensen interview"/>

Ministry announced on their website that they entered the studio on September 1, 2011 with engineer Sammy D\'Ambruoso to begin recording their new album.<ref name="reunion"/> During the third webisode featuring behind-the-scenes footage from the making of \'\'Relapse\'\', a release date of March 3, 2012 was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=166136|title=Ministry: The Making Of \'Relapse\' Webisode 3 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>

On December 23, 2011, Ministry released "[[99 Percenters]]", the first single from \'\'Relapse\'\', and began streaming it on their Facebook page two days later. On February 22, 2012, Ministry released a second single, "[[Double Tap (song)|Double Tap]]", which was included in the April 2012 issue of the [[Metal Hammer]] magazine.

In an interview with \'\'Noisey\'\' in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining that he does not want to carry on without Scaccia. "Mikey was my best friend in the world and there\'s no Ministry without him", he said. "But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can\'t do it without Mikey and I don\'t want to.

\'\'\'Missing Foundation\'\'\' was an [[industrial music]] and [[performance art]] project active in the late 1980s and early 1990s and led by [[Peter Missing]].  Their live shows were notorious for sparking civil disobedience (including the occasional riot) and causing serious damage to venues at which they performed, and they were in fact banned from some cities entirely.  The group was also infamous for their "The Party\'s Over" [[Graffiti|graffito]] of an upside-down martini glass, and was heavily involved in the [[Tompkins Square Park Riot (1988)|Tompkins Square Park Riot]] in August 1988. While the band disbanded in the early 1990s, a small [[Anarchism|anarchist]] social movement continued to exist under the same name for several years thereafter.<ref name=nyt1997/>

==History==
The earliest incarnation of the group, which was founded in Hamburg in 1984 by [[Peter Missing]], included [[Sascha Konietzko]] and [[En Esch]] of [[industrial music|industrial]] act [[KMFDM]], who were only with Missing Foundation briefly before going their own way.<ref name=kmfdm>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kmfdm-mn0000359062 | title=KMFDM Biography | author=Prato, Greg | publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] | accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref>

After Missing moved back to New York City in 1985, he started a new version of the group, and the line-up became more stable, with a core group of Missing, Florian Langmaack, Chris Egan, and Mark Ashwill.<ref name=allmusic-bio/>  The band\'s second album, \'\'1933\'\', was released in 1988,<ref name=allmusic-bio/> when the band\'s social unrest fomenting activities began to increase dramatically.  The group\'s upside-down martini logo had been spray painted all over the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] that year.<ref name=nyt1988/>  At a show in mid-1988 in New York, the group doused oil barrels in kerosene and set them on fire, then rolled them into the audience, causing major damage to C.B.G.B.\'s, the club where they were performing.<ref name=nyt1988>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/nyregion/the-talk-of-the-east-village-a-neighborhood-of-vigorous-opinions.html | author=Johnson, Kirk | title=The Talk of the East Village; A Neighborhood of Vigorous Opinions | work=[[New York Times]] | date=August 13, 1988 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref>  In a July 31 protest, one of the band members was arrested.<ref name=nyt1988-2>{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0714FD3D550C738DDDA10894D0484D81 |first=Michael |last=Wines | title=Class Struggle Erupts Along Avenue B | work=New York Times | date=August 10, 1988 | accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>  A week later, Missing helped organize another initially peaceful protest at [[Tompkins Square Park Riot (1988)|Tompkins Square Park]], which grew violent after the band performed a concert.<ref name=allmusic-bio/><ref name=villager>{{cite journal | url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_119/artistwhowasoncethecenter.html | author=Anderson, Lincoln | title=Artist who was once the center is now on the fringe | work=[[The Villager]] | volume=75 | issue=12 | date=August 10\xe2\x80\x9316, 2005 | accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>  Some cities began banning the group from performing for fear of similar destruction to their venues.<ref name=allmusic-bio/>

The group\'s biggest cultural impact, other than their disruptive live performances, was the creation of their infamous "The Party\'s Over" image of an upside-down martini glass, which became a symbol for political and social dissent.<ref name=nyt2002>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/29/nyregion/a-stirring-icon-that-shook-things-up-turns-20.html | author=Moynihan, Colin | title=A Stirring Icon That Shook Things Up Turns 20 | work=[[New York Times]] | date=April 29, 2002 | accessdate=July 22, 2012}}</ref>  The logo was part of a major graffiti campaign in New York\'s Lower East Side during the band\'s existence.<ref name=allmusic-bio/>  An accompanying phrase, \'\'1933-1988\'\', was added as a way to draw comparisons between contemporary New York and the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref name=nyt1988/>  The group was accused of [[Satanism]] by a WCBS-TV news<ref>http://sensitiveskinmagazine.com/missing-foundation-and-mike-taibbis-cult-of-rage/</ref> during the height of their influence.<ref name=allmusic-bio/>

After releasing a total of five albums, the group disbanded in 1992, and Missing moved to Berlin.<ref name=allmusic-bio/>

\'\'\'The Neon Judgement\'\'\' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[New wave music|new wave]] band, formed in [[Leuven]] in 1981 by Dirk Da Davo (keyboards/vocalist) and TB Frank (guitarist/vocalist). These Belgian musicians have often been considered the pioneers of [[electronic body music]] (EBM), together with another Belgian band, [[Front 242]]. EBM is a high-tech genre from the early \'80s, combining [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electro (music)|electro]] music, from which later originated [[new beat]] and [[techno]].

Davo Da Davo and TB Frank veered between minimalistic industrial drones and odd, new wave synthpop and dance music, underlain by cold, mechanical rhythms. Their initial music is aggressive, danceable and dominated by synthesizers and drum-machines. A bit later on in their career, the guitar also had a prominent place in their music.

The Neon Judgement recorded most of their output for the Play It Again Sam label in Belgium, beginning with 1986\'s \'\'Mafu Cage\'\'. Their first American release did not come until 1987, with the sex-themed concept album, \'\'Horny As Hell\'\'. Subsequent recordings included \'\'Blood and Thunder\'\' (1989), \'\'The Insult\'\' (1990), and \'\'Are You Real\'\' (1992).

The duo took a three-year hiatus to rethink the direction of their music, after which they returned in 1995 with \'\'At Devil\'s Fork\'\', an LP recorded with percussionist Ben Forceville entirely in a wooded area.

The band briefly stopped performing in 1998, but reformed in 2004 and started performing live again to promote a series of remixes and re-releases of their material. The touring continued into 2006, with the band promising on their [http://www.theneonjudgement.com/ website] that, "Live, The Neon Judgement will continue to give art terrorism a good name, finding new ways of marrying noise and beauty, machines and magic".

Dirk Da Davo is also in the side project Neon Electronics, for which he started his own record label Dancedelic-D and he both reworks old classics and composes new material.

In November 2005, the Neon Judgement did a show at the Machina Festival at the Broadway Club in [[S\xc3\xa3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The festival celebrated the first eight years of the site FiberOnline and the launch of the label Fiber Records. Fiber Records released the DVD \'\'The Neon Judgement \xe2\x80\x93 Live at Machina Festival\'\' in 2005 featuring the whole concert of 13 songs.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26694_0_2_1_C The Neon Judgement live at Machina Festival DVD out now]</ref> 

In 2007, the band released the compilation album \'\'Redbox\'\'.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25107_0_2_1_C The Neon Judgement announces \'\'Redbox\'\']</ref> The release comes after the success of the 100% vintage 2&nbsp;CD \'\'Box\'\' released in October 2005. \'\'Redbox\'\' mainly contains the band\'s work during the second half of the 1980s. The album also features [[remix]]es from acts such as David Carretta, Blackstrobe, Lifelike, and Helmut Kraft. \'\'Redbox\'\' also contains a brand new recording, namely a cover version of "[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]" (by [[David Bowie]] and [[Brian Eno]]).

The band\'s most recent album is \'\'Smack\'\', released in 2009.

\'\'\'N17\'\'\' (sometimes known as \'\'\'November 17\'\'\') is an [[Industrial metal]] band from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[United States]]. They released two albums and were signed to Slipdisc Records (a division of Mercury Records) until the label closed in late 1999. They are also signed to [[Spitfire Records]].

==History==
Formed in 1993 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], \'\'\'N17\'\'\' was one of the original crossover electronic/metal bands. Maintaining a sound of timeless music with their record\xe2\x80\x99s; debut \'\'[[Trust No One (N17 album)|Trust No One]]\'\' and follow-up \'\'[[Defy Everything]]\'\', the group has stayed true to its run as a band. N17 combines aggressive sound-scapes with heavy guitar riffs, electronic elements and intensive drumming.

The band takes their name from the November 17, 1973, student uprising at [[Athens Polytechnic University]]. Twenty students were killed when Greek army tanks suppressed the protests, and the group formed in part to retaliate against the ruling military junta.

N17 has played and toured with notable bands including [[Marilyn Manson]], [[The Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Fear Factory]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Sevendust]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and many others.

According to the band\'s official MySpace page, they announced that they were working on a third studio album, due for release sometime in Fall 2007, as well as a DVD, to be released around the same time as the album. This post was later removed, and another post was published stating that they were disbanding due to the fact that they were busy with other projects. Their final show was on November 17, 2007.  The band re-united for a show on November 14, 2009 and have announced shows for 2010. Most recently For the first time since 2002, the band reunited for a 4 song surprise reunion with original member Chris Cannella in early 2011.

\'\'\'Gary Anthony James Webb\'\'\' (born 8 March 1958), better known by his stage name \'\'\'Gary Numan\'\'\', is an English singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. Born in [[Hammersmith]], London, he first entered the music industry as the lead singer of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Tubeway Army]]. After releasing two albums with the band, Numan released his debut solo album \'\'[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]\'\' in 1979. Most widely known for his chart-topping hits "[[Are \'Friends\' Electric?]]" and "[[Cars (song)|Cars]]", Numan achieved his peak of mainstream popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but maintains a loyal [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Gary Numan: Artist Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gary-numan-mn0000183858/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>

Numan, whose signature sound consists of heavy synthesizer [[Hook (music)|hooks]] fed through guitar [[effects pedals]], is considered a pioneer of commercial [[electronic music]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Conmy|first=Mick|title=Gary Numan review|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2008/03/17/numan_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC Online|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rik|title=Review, Gary Numan\'s "Hybrid"|url=http://www.fluxeuropa.com/gary_numan-hybrid.htm|publisher=Fluxeuropa|date=23 February 2003|accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Hammersmith]], England, Gary Anthony James Webb was the son of a British Airways bus driver based at Heathrow Airport. Webb was educated at Town Farm Junior School in [[Stanwell]], [[Surrey]] and [[Ashford, Middlesex|Ashford]] County Grammar School, then [[Slough Grammar School]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/garynuman.htm |title=Gary Numan: Best Music from the 1980s |publisher=80smusiclyrics.com |date=8 March 1958 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> [[Berkshire]] and Brooklands Technical College, Surrey. He joined the [[Air Training Corps]] as a teenager. He then briefly did various jobs including fork lift truck driver, air conditioning ventilator fitter, and clerk in an accounts department. When Numan was 15 years old, his father bought him a [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar, which he regards as his most treasured possession.<ref name=Webber>{{cite web|last=Webber|first=Richard|title=Gary Numan: I had so much cash, all I wanted to do was spend|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9028387/Gary-Numan-I-had-so-much-cash-all-I-wanted-to-do-was-spend.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=24 July 2012|date=22 January 2012}}</ref> He played in various bands, including Mean Street and The Lasers, before forming [[Tubeway Army]] with his uncle, [[Jess Lidyard]], and [[Paul Gardiner]]. His initial pseudonym was \'\'"Valerian"\'\', probably in reference to the hero in French science fiction comic series \'\'[[Val\xc3\xa9rian and Laureline]]\'\'.<ref>Steve Malins (1999). \'\'The Plan\'\' 1999 reissue liner notes</ref> Later he picked the name "Numan" from an advert in the [[Yellow Pages]] for a plumber named A. Neumann.<ref>\'\'Synth Britannia at the BBC\'\' program aired October 2009 on BBC4</ref>

==Career==

===1970s===

====Tubeway Army====
Numan rose to prominence at the end of the 1970s as front man, writer, and producer for [[Tubeway Army]]. After recording an album\'s worth of [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] (released in 1984 as \'\'The Plan\'\'), he was signed by [[Beggars Banquet Records]] in 1978 and quickly released two singles, "[[That\'s Too Bad]]" and "[[Bombers (Gary Numan single)|Bombers]]", neither of which charted.

A self-titled, [[New wave music|new wave]]-oriented [[Tubeway Army (album)|debut album]] later that same year sold out its limited run and introduced Numan\'s fascination with [[dystopia]]n science fiction<ref name=Europopmusic>{{cite web|title=Part 6: "Are friends electric? "|url=http://www.europopmusic.eu/Newsletters/History_electronic_music_part_6.html|work=The history of electronic music within European pop?"|publisher=Europopmusic|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and synthesizers. Tubeway Army\'s third single, the dark-themed and slow-paced "[[Down in the Park]]" (1979), also failed to chart, but it would prove to be one of Numan\'s most enduring and oft-covered songs. It was featured with other contemporary hits on the soundtrack for the movie \'\'[[Times Square (film)|Times Square]]\'\', and a live version of the song can be seen in the movie \'\'[[Urgh! A Music War]]\'\'. Following exposure in a television advertisement for Lee Cooper jeans with the jingle "Don\'t be a Dummy",<ref name=Europopmusic /> Tubeway Army released the single "[[Are \'Friends\' Electric?]]" in May 1979. The single took seven weeks before finally reaching No.&nbsp;1 at the end of June; the parent album \'\'[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]\'\' simultaneously reached No.&nbsp;1.

====As Gary Numan====
A few months later Numan found success in the charts on both sides of the [[Atlantic]] with "[[Cars (song)|Cars]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in the UK in 1979, No.&nbsp;1 in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.0189a&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=ccntousk30frf6h4jsn237nm12 |title=Item Display \xe2\x80\x93 RPM \xe2\x80\x93 Library and Archives Canada |publisher=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> and No.&nbsp;9 in the US in 1980. "Cars" and the 1979 album \'\'[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]\'\' were both released under Numan\'s own stage name. The album reached number one in the UK, and a sell-out tour (\'The Touring Principle\') followed; the concert video it spawned is often cited as the first full-length commercial music video release.<ref>[http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/music/apr14.htm On this day in music]. Retrieved 15 May 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.westnet.com/consumable/1997/04.21/revnuman.html \'\'Premier Hits\'\' review]. Retrieved 15 May 2007.</ref> \'\'The Pleasure Principle\'\' was a rock album with no guitars; instead, Numan used synthesizers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted, phased, metallic tone. A second single from the album, "[[Complex (song)|Complex]]", made it to No.&nbsp;6 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]].

====Personality and style====
Around this time, Numan also developed his style. According to Numan, this was an unintentional result of [[acne]]; before an appearance on \'\'[[Top of the Pops]]\'\', he had "spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white makeup on me before I\'d even walked in the door. And my eyes were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show".<ref name=Lester/> His "wooden" stage presence was, in his words, a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of "showmanship".<ref name=Lester /> During this period, Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves "Numanoids", providing him with a [[fanbase]] which maintained their support through the latter half of the 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall precipitously.<ref name=Lester /><ref>http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792</ref>

He later said that he, "Got really hung up with this whole thing of not feeling, being cold about everything, not letting emotions get to you, or presenting a front of not feeling".<ref name=Lester>{{cite web|author=Paul Lester |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/dec/03/gary-numan-little-boots-feature |title=When Gary Numan met Little Boots |date=3 December 2009 |work=The Guardian  |location=UK |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

===1980s===
[[File:Gary Numan playing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Numan performing in February 1980.]]
In 1980, Gary Numan topped the album charts for a third time with \'\'[[Telekon]]\'\', with the singles "[[We Are Glass]]", "[[I Die: You Die]]" released prior to the album reaching No.&nbsp;5 and No.&nbsp;6. "[[This Wreckage]]" taken from the album in December also entered the Top 20. \'\'Telekon\'\', the final studio album that Numan retrospectively termed the "Machine" section of his career,<ref>Gary Numan (1981). \'\'Living Ornaments \'79/\'80\'\': LP Liner notes</ref> reintroduced guitars to Numan\'s music and featured a wider range of synthesizers. The same year he embarked on his second major tour ("The Teletour") with an even more elaborate stage show than The Touring Principle the previous year. He announced his retirement from touring with a series of sell-out concerts at [[Wembley Arena]] in April 1981, supported by experimental musician [[Nash the Slash]] and [[Shock (troupe)|Shock]], a rock/mime/burlesque troupe whose members included [[Barbie Wilde]], [[Tik and Tok]], and [[Carole Caplin]]. A live two album set from the 1979 and 1980 tours released at this time reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. Both albums, also individually released as [[Living Ornaments \'79]] and [[Living Ornaments \'80]] also charted. The decision to retire would be short-lived.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Departing from the pure [[electro-pop]] that he had been associated with, Numan began experimenting with [[jazz]], [[funk]], and ethereal, rhythmic pop. His first album after his 1981 farewell concerts was \'\'[[Dance (Gary Numan album)|Dance]]\'\' (1981). The album charted as high as No.&nbsp;3 on the [[UK Albums Chart|UK charts]], with an eight-week chart run and produced one hit single ("She\'s Got Claws") reaching No.&nbsp;6.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The album featured several distinguished guest players; [[Mick Karn]] (bass, saxophone) and Rob Dean (guitar) of [[Japan (band)|Japan]], Roger Mason (keyboards) of [[Models (band)|Models]], and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] (drums) of [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=D|first1=Steve|url=http://www.discogs.com/Gary-Numan-Dance/release/1212792|website=Discogs|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

With his former backing band, Chris John Payne (Keyboards, Viola), Russell Bell (Guitar), and Ced Sharpley (Drums) now reformed as [[Dramatis]], Numan contributed vocals to the minor hit "Love Needs No Disguise" from the album \'\'[[For Future Reference]]\'\' and lent vocals to the first single release by his long-term right-hand man [[Paul Gardiner]], "[[Stormtrooper In Drag]]", which also made the charts. However, Numan\'s career had begun to experience a gradual decline, and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as [[Adam Ant]], and later by [[The Human League]], [[Duran Duran]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. Each album also saw a new "image", none of which captured the public\'s imagination to nearly the same extent as the lonely android of 1979.<ref name=Lester />

The album \'\'[[I, Assassin]]\'\' (1982) fared less well than \'\'Dance\'\'. Despite producing one Top 10 and two Top 20 singles, the album peaked at No.&nbsp;8 with a six-week chart run.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Numan supported the album with a concert tour in America in late 1982 (where he was living as a [[tax exile]]), which were his first series of live shows since his farewell at Wembley.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

\'\'[[Warriors (Gary Numan album)|Warriors]]\'\' (1983) further developed Numan\'s jazz-influenced style and featured contributions from [[avant-garde music]]ian [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]] (who fell out with Numan during recording and chose to be uncredited as the album\'s co-producer), and saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]] (who would play on most of Numan\'s albums until 1991).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;12, produced two hit singles including the Top 20 title track and, like \'\'I, Assassin\'\', spent six weeks in the charts. \'\'Warriors\'\' was the last album Numan recorded for Beggars Banquet Records, and was supported by a 40-date UK tour (again with support from robotic mime and music duo Tik and Tok) \xe2\x80\x93 Numan\'s first live tour in the UK since his Wembley appearances in 1981.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Numan subsequently issued a series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. As the decade continued, he tried to recapture his former chart glory with less distinguished albums, some of which were stylistically derivative of artists like [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The first album released on Numa, 1984\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[Berserker (Gary Numan album)|Berserker]]\'\' was also notable for being Numan\'s first foray into music computers/[[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], in this case the [[Palm Products GmbH|PPG Wave]]. \'\'Berserker\'\' moved away from the fluid, fretless sound that characterised Numan\'s previous three albums, featuring instead harder-edged electric bass and drum sounds.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The album was also accompanied by a striking new blue-and-white visual image (including Numan himself with blue hair), a tour, a live album/video/EP, and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numan\xe2\x80\x99s least successful release to that point.

Numan\'s next album, \'\'[[The Fury (album)|The Fury]]\'\' (1985), charted slightly higher than \'\'Berserker\'\' breaking the top 30. Again, the album heralded a change of image, this time featuring Numan in a white suit and red bow tie. Four singles were released from the album, all reaching the UK Top 50.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Collaborations with Bill Sharpe of [[Shakatak]] helped little, though two singles that the duo recorded did see chart action: "Change Your Mind", reached No.&nbsp;17 in 1985, and "No More Lies" reached No.&nbsp;35 in 1988. Numa Records, which had been launched in a flurry of idealistic excitement, folded after the release of Numan\'s 1986 album \'\'Strange Charm\'\', though the album did contain two top 30 hits (Numan\'s highest singles chart placings since 1983).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In addition to Numa Records\' commercial failure, Numan\'s own fortune amassed since the late 1970s, which he estimated at \xc2\xa34.5&nbsp;million, was drained. Numan then signed to [[I.R.S. Records|IRS Records]] though his final studio album of the 1980s, \'\'[[Metal Rhythm]]\'\' (1988), also sold relatively poorly. For its American release, the record label changed the album\'s title to \'\'New Anger\'\' after the album\'s lead single, changed the album colour from black to blue, and remixed several of its tracks against Numan\'s wishes. In 1989, the Sharpe and Numan album \'\'Automatic\'\' was released through [[Polydor Records]], though this too failed to garner much commercial success, briefly entering the charts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===1990s===
In 1991, Gary Numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for \'\'The Unborn\'\' with Michael R. Smith (the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995, \'\'Human\'\'). After \'\'[[Outland (Gary Numan album)|Outland]]\'\' (1991), another critical and commercial disappointment and his second and last studio album with IRS, Numan reactivated Numa Records, under which he would release his next two albums. By 1994, Numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes, including his vocal [[atheism]]. His future wife Gemma encouraged him to strip away the influences of the more recent years. Numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher, more [[industrial music|industrial]] direction with his songwriting on the album \'\'[[Sacrifice (Gary Numan album)|Sacrifice]]\'\'&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 for the first time he played almost all the instruments himself. The move was critically well-received, as Numan\'s harder and darker sound emerged just as Numan-influenced bands like [[Nine Inch Nails]] were enjoying their first rush of fame. The influence was two-way; Numan claimed that Nine Inch Nails\' song "[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]" is his favourite hit single of all time, and influenced his music. \'\'Sacrifice\'\' was the last album Numan made before shutting down Numa Records permanently. His next two albums, \'\'[[Exile (Gary Numan album)|Exile]]\'\' (1997) and \'\'[[Pure (Gary Numan album)|Pure]]\'\' (2000), were well received and significantly helped to restore his critical reputation. Numan toured the U.S. in support of \'\'Exile\'\', his first stateside concerts since the early 1980s.<ref name=Lester />

===2000s===
[[File:MrGaryNuman.jpg|thumb|200px|Gary Numan performing in 2007]]
Gary Numan had become acknowledged and respected by his peers, with such musicians as [[Dave Grohl]] (of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), [[Trent Reznor]] (of Nine Inch Nails), and [[Marilyn Manson (person)|Marilyn Manson]] proclaiming his work an influence and recording cover versions of old Numan hits.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RCoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=marilyn+manson+gary+numan#v=onepage&q=marilyn%20manson%20gary%20numan&f=false |title=CMJ New Music Monthly |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=15 May 2011|date=May 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sally Williams |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/11/16/gary-numan-dave-grohl-is-very-nice-man-91466-25163264/ |title=Gary Numan: \xe2\x80\x98Dave Grohl is very nice man\xe2\x80\x99 |publisher=WalesOnline |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> The band [[Basement Jaxx]] had a huge hit in 2002 with "[[Where\'s Your Head At?]]", which relied on a sample of Numan\'s "M.E." \xe2\x80\x93 from \'\'The Pleasure Principle\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 for its hook. [[Fear Factory]] produced a cover of "Cars" (featuring a prominent guest appearance by Numan himself) for the [[digipak]] version of their album \'\'[[Obsolete (album)|Obsolete]]\'\'. Nine Inch Nails covered the song "Metal" on [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|The Fragile]] remix album \'\'[[Things Falling Apart]]\'\' as did [[Afrika Bambaataa]] (with Numan himself) on the album \'\'[[Dark Matter Moving at the Speed of Light]]\'\'. "Cars" remains Numan\'s most enduring song; it was a hit again in 1987 (remixed by [[Zeus B. Held]]) and 1996, in the latter case thanks to an appearance in an advert for [[Carling]] beer. In 2000 DJ [[Armand Van Helden]] sampled the track and mixed it up in his single "Koochy" which conquered the dancefloors. In 2002, UK pop trio [[Sugababes]] scored a No.&nbsp;1 with "[[Freak Like Me (Sugababes song)|Freak Like Me]]" \xe2\x80\x93 a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of [[Adina Howard]]\'s "Freak Like Me" and "Are Friends Electric?" by Numan\'s Tubeway Army.

Other musicians, and at least one comedian, who have sung Numan\'s praises in recent years include [[Beck]], [[Grant Nicholas]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[Audio Antihero]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/paint-it-back-gary-numan-pure-by-jamie-audio-antihero-records/ |title=Paint It Back // Gary Numan ~ Pure ~ by Jamie (Audio Antihero Records) |publisher=GoldFlakePaint |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref> [[Damon Albarn]] & [[Matt Sharp]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[Noel Fielding]], [[Phil Oakey]] from [[The Human League]], [[John Foxx]], [[Andy McCluskey]] from [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] and Afrika Bambaataa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} "Cars" was featured on the soundtrack for the blockbuster 2002 [[videogame]] \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]\'\' as part of the new wave radio station [[Wave 103]], although it did not appear on the soundtrack CD release for the game. "Are Friends Electric" appeared on EA\'s game \'\'[[Need For Speed: Carbon]]\'\' in 2006.

In 2002, Numan enjoyed chart success once again with the single "Rip", reaching No.&nbsp;29 in the UK chart and in 2003 with the Gary Numan vs Rico single "Crazier", which reached No.&nbsp;13 in the UK chart. Rico also worked on the remix album \'\'Hybrid\'\' which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material. Other artists and producers who contributed on these remixes included [[Curve (band)|Curve]], [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]], [[Alan Moulder]], New Disease, and Sulpher. 2003 also saw Numan performing the vocals on a track named "Pray For You" on the [[Plump DJs]] album \'\'Eargasm\'\', which was well received. In 2004 Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs. In late 2005, Numan announced on his website that recording would begin on his new album in January 2006, with Ade Fenton co-producing. The album, \'\'[[Jagged]]\'\', was duly released on 13 March 2006 and saw Numan back in the UK album charts. An album launch gig took place at The Forum, London on 18 March followed by UK, European and US tours in support of the release. Numan also launched a \'\'Jagged\'\' website to showcase the new album, and made plans to have his 1981 farewell concert (previously released as \'\'Micromusic\'\' on VHS) issued on DVD by November 2006 as well as releasing the DVD version of the \'\'Jagged\'\' album launch gig. Numan undertook a \'\'Telekon\'\' \'Classic Album\' tour in the UK in December 2006.

On 6 November 2006, Numan took part in the [[Sky1]] reality show \'\'[[The Race (TV series)|The Race]]\'\'. It pitted ten celebrities (five male, five female) against each other in a series of [[Formula One]]-style [[auto racing|car races]]. These races were held at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] over the next five days, and varied in racing styles, ultimately culminating in one final Grand Prix race on Sunday, 12 November. Numan did win on the overall leaderboard, though he lost the final race to [[AC/DC]] lead singer [[Brian Johnson]].{{Citation needed|date= July 2012}}
[[File:Gary numan bestival 09 08 (cropped brighter).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gary Numan performing at Bestival in September 2008]]

Numan contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of the debut solo album by [[Ade Fenton]] \'\'Artificial Perfect\'\' on his new industrial/electronic label Submission, including songs "The Leather Sea", "Slide Away", "Recall", and the first single to be taken from the album, "Healing". The second single to be released in the UK was "The Leather Sea" on 30 July 2007, which charted.

He sold out a fifteen-date UK & Ireland tour in Spring 2008 during which he performed his 1979 number one album \'\'Replicas\'\' in full, and all the Replicas-era music including B-sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26872_0_2_0_C |title=Gary Numan to perform album \'Replicas\' live |publisher=Side-line.com |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> The highly successful tour also raised Numan\'s profile in the media again due to the fact that it coincided with his 30th anniversary in the music business.

In November 2007, Numan confirmed via his website that work on a new album, with the working title of \'\'Splinter\'\', would be under way throughout 2008, after finishing an alternate version of \'\'Jagged\'\' (called \'\'[[Jagged Edge (Gary Numan album)|Jagged Edge]]\'\') and the CD of unreleased songs from his previous three albums (confirmed to be titled \'\'Dead Son Rising\'\' on 1 December 2008 via official mailing list message). He wrote that \'\'Splinter\'\' was likely to be released in early 2010.

In a September 2009 interview with The Quietus, Numan says that he and Trent Reznor plan to make music together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/02803-gary-numan-and-nine-inch-nail-s-trent-reznor-to-collaborate |title=Gary Numan And Trent Reznor To Collaborate |publisher=Thequietus.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

===2010s===
Gary Numan was set to perform a small number of American live dates in April 2010, including a Coachella Festival appearance in California, but had to cancel because air travel in Europe was halted by the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\xc3\xb6kull|Icelandic volcanic ash cloud]]. As a result, the tour was not only postponed but expanded, and his Pleasure Principle 30th Anniversary Tour\'s American and Mexican dates began on 17 October 2010, at Firestone Live in [[Orlando, Florida]].{{Citation needed|date= July 2012}}

Numan toured Australia in May 2011 performing his seminal album The Pleasure Principle in its entirety to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. Joining him on tour was Australian electronic band [[Severed Heads]], coming out of retirement especially for the shows.<ref>{{cite news |first=Selenna |last=Nieva |title=Gary Numan to tour Australia |url=http://valleyarm.com/featured-artist/gary-numan-to-tour-australia |publisher=[[Valleyarm]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011 }}</ref>

Numan lent his vocals to the track "My Machines" on [[Battles (band)|Battles]]\'s 2011 album "[[Gloss Drop]]". He has been chosen by [[Battles (band)|Battles]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow\'s Parties (music festival)|ATP Nightmare Before Christmas]] festival that they co-curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/nightmare2011.php |title=ATP Nightmare Before Christmas |publisher=Atpfestival.com |accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref> Numan\'s new album \'\'[[Dead Son Rising]]\'\' was released on 16 September 2011 which had a full UK tour split in two halves,  15\xe2\x80\x9321 September and  7\xe2\x80\x9311 December, Both parts were supported by Welsh soloist [[Jayce Lewis]] in an interview during the tour; Gary praised the Welshman to being the best supporting act ever in his 30 years of touring, later documenting the tour in a Tour diary and publicly inviting Jayce to join him for an American tour in 2012.<ref>[http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/tour-diary-gary-numan.html Tour Diary: Gary Numan]. \'\'[[The Stool Pigeon (newspaper)|The Stool Pigeon]]\'\' (5 January 2012).

Numan also provided narration for [[Voltaire (musician)|Voltaire]]\'s short film \'\'Odokuro\'\' in 2011.

While working on a new album due for release in 2013, Numan said "The one I\xe2\x80\x99m working on now which I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get out in the middle of next year. It\xe2\x80\x99s very heavy, very aggressive and very dark. There are elements of Dead Son Rising in that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s much further along that particular road." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://npollard.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/interview-gary-numan/ |title=Interview: Gary Numan \xc2\xab NICK POLLARD |publisher=Npollard.wordpress.com |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-12-20}}</ref>

The new album, \'\'[[Splinter (Songs From A Broken Mind)]]\'\', was released to critical acclaim worldwide on 14 October 2013. The album reached the UK Top 20, his first album to do so for 30 years. It was promoted by an extensive US, Canada, UK & Ireland tour which continued in 2014 to include Israel, New Zealand, Australia and Europe. A further US leg took place in late 2014.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In June 2014 Numan collaborated with Welshman [[Jayce Lewis]] and his Protafield project on the track \'\'Redesign\'\' featured on Protafield\'s \'\'Nemesis\'\' Album <ref>https://twitter.com/numanofficial/status/527163702328315904</ref>  
Numan also provided vocals for the song "Long Way Down" composed by [[Masafumi Takada]] and Rich Dickerson for [[The Evil Within]] video game. The game was released on 14 October 2014. Select tracks from the soundtrack were in included on a CD as an Amazon exclusive pre-order bonus which featured "Long Way Down".
Numan performed a sold-out, one-off live show in London in November 2014 at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] supported by [[Gang Of Four]] and it is anticipated that this show will be released on DVD in 2015.

Numan, in collaboration with [[Ade Fenton]] released the [[From Inside: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] in 2015, his first foray into film scoring since 1995\'s [[Human]].

At age 15, after a series of outbursts in which Numan would "smash things up, scream and shout, get in people\'s faces and break stuff", he was prescribed [[antidepressants]] and [[anxiolytics]].<ref name=Lester /> Numan\'s wife later suggested he had [[Asperger syndrome]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/numan-convinced-he-has-aspergers_1060637|work=Contact News|location=US|title=Gary Numan \xe2\x80\x93 Numan Convinced He Has Asperger\'s|date=25 February 2008}}</ref> In a 2001 interview, he said: "Polite conversation has never been one of my strong points.

Following the apparent harassment of his wife while his family was walking on a [[High Street]] in his local area, and his feelings following the [[2011 London Riots]] Numan filed papers to emigrate to the United States [[Santa Monica, California]]. Numan said "Every village and town in England has a bunch of thugs running around in it. The riots were the nail in the coffin".<ref>[http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/20/gary-numan-moving-to-us-after-riot "Gary Numan moving to U.S. after riot"] \'\'Toronto Sun\'\', 20 August 2011.

He explained that he had "never been abused in my local high street," and has "made no firm decision about leaving the UK" but thugs are helping make such a decision, pointing out that the rioting "makes us look like a country of ignorant savages, beating up people already injured, pretending to help while stealing their things, hitting old men, killing them."  He went on to explain that soundtracks may be a logical step, as he gets older and since "in the UK we have no meaningful film industry to speak of," a move to the U.S. might be more reasonable.  He concluded by saying his family are highest priority and, "If I see somewhere that seems safer, happier, and will give them a better life than the UK, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take them there if I possibly can."<ref name="Official 9-2011">{{cite web|last=Numan|first=Gary|title=Q & A \xe2\x80\x93 September 11|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203004250/http://www.numan.co.uk/q-a/|work=Gary Numan - Official Web Site - archived link|publisher=Gary Numan|accessdate=9 January 2014}}</ref>

\'\'\'Oomph!\'\'\' (pronounced "oomf"<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oomph</ref><ref>[http://deutschmusikland.com/interviews/interview_oomph.html Interview: Oomph!]</ref>) is a German musical group  formed in [[Wolfsburg, Germany]] in 1989. The band is considered the pioneers of the German [[Neue Deutsche H\xc3\xa4rte]] movement.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/oomph%21-mn0000400479/biography | title=Oomph! | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=April 5, 2014 | author=Reges, Margeret}}</ref> Since the band\'s formation there have been no line-up changes, except for live personnel.

==Band history==

===Early years (1989\xe2\x80\x932002)===
Oomph! incorporates many styles of music such as metal, industrial, alternative rock, electronica and gothic to create their sound. Oomph!\'s change of style between their [[Oomph! (album)|self-titled debut]] (1992) and its successor \'\'[[Sperm (album)|Sperm]]\'\' (1994), leaning more heavily to a [[guitar]]-driven [[Heavy metal music|metal]] sound without giving up their [[Electronic body music|electronic]] roots, inspired numerous musicians, most famously [[Rammstein]], [[Megaherz]] and [[Eisbrecher]], to follow their lead.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Oomph!/+wiki/diff?&a=15&b=16 Oomph\'s Biography]</ref>

Oomph! released their first album on [[Jor Jenka|Jor]]\'s [[Machinery Records|Machinery]] label, then releasing their consecutive albums on its sister label [[Dynamica]]. They stayed with Jor, until his labels disappeared during the acquisition by [[Sanctuary Records]] at around 1996/1997.<ref>[http://www.reference.com/browse/oomph] Oomph- Reference</ref>

Oomph! finally signed on [[Virgin Schallplatten]]. Between 1998 and 2001, they released three albums on the Virgin label. The first, \'\'[[Unrein]]\'\', was released in 1998, which became their debut album in the [[Media Control Charts]], peaking at No.&nbsp;37, and the Austrian top 40 at No.&nbsp;38. A single called "[[Gekreuzigt]]" was released in 1998 to promote \'\'Unrein\'\' and became the band\'s debut single on the German charts, peaking at No.&nbsp;81.

The second Virgin album, \'\'[[Plastik]]\'\', was released in 1999 and peaked in Germany at No.&nbsp;23. The third, \'\'[[Ego (album)|Ego]]\'\', was released in 2001, peaking at No.&nbsp;21 in the Media Control Charts. This fulfilled their contract with Virgin; the band did not continue with the record company, feeling that it never fully explored their potential. With the benefits of major-label status, however, Oomph! gained a larger following and toured with labelmates [[Skunk Anansie]] in 1999, later opening for the Finnish rock band [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]] in fall 2001.

In 2002, Oomph! played at the [[Ozzfest]] in Germany, alongside [[Black Label Society]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on 20 May. The band appeared at the [[With Full Force]] Festival on July 5, 2002. On December 19, 2002, Oomph! opened for [[Apoptygma Berzerk]].

===\'\'Wahrheit oder Pflicht\'\' and \'\'GlaubeLiebeTod\'\' (2004\xe2\x80\x932007)===
In 2004, Oomph! released their first single "[[Augen Auf!]]" ("Eyes Open!") on a new label, this time on [[Supersonic Records]], part of the [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony BMG]] group of music companies, from their eighth album \'\'[[Wahrheit oder Pflicht]]\'\'. It marks their first number one hit in Germany, thus eventually bringing forth their major commercial breakthrough. The album hit number 2 in the [[Media Control Charts]].

In June 2004, Oomph! played at two major European music festivals: the [[Dynamo Open Air]] Festival on June 5, in the [[Netherlands]] and on June 25 at the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] in [[Belgium]].

"Augen auf!" became part of the \'\'[[FIFA 2005]]\'\' soundtrack. Oomph! appeared for the first time at [[Wacken Open Air]] on August 4, 2005.

The band\'s ninth album, \'\'[[GlaubeLiebeTod]]\'\' (\'\'FaithLoveDeath\'\') was released in March 2006, including the controversial single \'\'[[Gott ist ein Popstar!]]\'\' ("God is a Popstar!"), its follow-up \'\'[[Das letzte Streichholz]]\'\', \'\'[[Die Schlinge]]\'\' and \'\'[[Tr\xc3\xa4umst Du?]]\'\'.

In August 2006, Virgin released the compilation album \'\'[[1998-2001: Best of Virgin Years]]\'\'. It contains tracks from Oomph!\'s three Virgin albums as well as a few unreleased tracks. The band distanced itself from this best-of release and asked the fans not buy it as the band\'s current label GUN had scheduled a best-of compilation as well.

On June 15, 2006, Oomph! played at the [[Nova Rock Festival]] in [[Austria]].

On December 1, 2006, Oomph!\'s official best-of album, \'\'[[Delikatessen (Oomph! album)|Delikatessen]]\'\' (\'\'Delicacies\'\') was released under the GUN label. The songs on it were hand-picked by the band itself. It contains tracks from all nine Oomph! albums, b-sides, remixes and never-heard before tracks like "The Power of Love" and "Gekreuzigt\'06". By November 17, 2006, Oomph! released those two songs in a form of double single to promote the new compilation release.

On February 9, 2007, the band released their final \'\'GlaubeLiebeTod\'\' single \xe2\x80\x93 "[[Tr\xc3\xa4umst Du?]]", featuring the female vocalist from [[Die Happy]], [[Marta Jandov\xc3\xa1]]. The single peaked at number 9 in the media control charts. Oomph! performed the song live the same day at the 2007 edition of [[Bundesvision Song Contest]], representing [[Lower Saxony]] in the competition, coming in first place.

On July 6, 2007, Oomph! opened for [[Metallica]] in [[Vienna, Austria]].

Oomph!\'s first DVD was \'\'[[Rohstoff]]\'\', which contains live footage consisting of 23 songs, most of the videos the band has created, making-of videos, and an exclusive interview. The DVD was released on July 20, 2007.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=24164_0_2_0_C Oomph! come up with first live DVD]</ref>

===\'\'Monster\'\' and \'\'Truth or Dare\'\' (2008\xe2\x80\x932010)===
A new song called "[[Wach Auf!]]" appeared in the film \'\'[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]\'\'; the single was released on January 4, 2008.
Oomph! made their first appearances at the [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock am Ring]] and [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|Rock im Park]] Festivals on June 6, 2008.

Oomph! released their tenth album, \'\'[[Monster (Oomph! album)|Monster]]\'\', on August 22, 2008, which peaked in the [[Media Control Charts]] at number 8. The band\'s most successful single from the new album is "[[Labyrinth (Oomph! song)|Labyrinth]]", released in September 2008, which peaked at number 26 in the Media Control Charts. The remaining tracks were to be released as [[B-side]]s on the upcoming singles. The first and only was "[[Sandmann (Oomph! song)|Sandmann]]", released in February 2009. \'\'Monster\'\' was reissued in June 2009 to include "Sandmann".

Oomph! opened for [[Marilyn Manson]] on June 24, 2009 in [[Linz, Austria]].

On February 26, 2010, the band released their fourth compilation album, \'\'[[Truth or Dare (Oomph! album)|Truth or Dare]]\'\', with their German songs re-recorded in English.<ref>[http://www.oomph.de/oomph/news_en.html Oomph\'s Official Page]</ref> Then, from April 24 to October 22, the band toured Europe to promote the new compilation album.

On September 10, 2010, Oomph! debuted the song "Sieger" (German for "Winner"), which was written for the ESL Pro Series 17, to a worldwide audience. The song had previously only been heard at the  [[Gamescom#Gamescom 2010|Gamescom 2010]] trade fair.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Oomph!/+news/3wo301_premiere_of_the_new_song_%22sieger%22 Premiere of the new song "Sieger"]</ref>

 ****** Pailhead

b'{{use mdy dates|date=April 2015}}
\'\'\'Pailhead\'\'\' was a short-lived [[side project]] of the [[industrial metal]] band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] that featured [[Dischord Records]] founder and former [[Minor Threat]] frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] on vocals.  The band\'s sound was a dark combination of menacing [[Industrial music|industrial]] beats and [[hardcore punk]], predating what Ministry would later do with [[Jello Biafra]] in another side project [[Lard (band)|Lard]].

==Background==
While [[Alain Jourgensen]] was living in London, he met Ian MacKaye. MacKaye had been in Washington D.C. punk bands [[The Teen Idles]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Skewbald/Grand Union]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]] and was on the verge of forming [[Fugazi]], while Jorgensen was taking his band Ministry into new territory\xe2\x80\x94away from the more [[pop music|pop]] sound of \'\'[[With Sympathy]]\'\' and toward the harder sound of \'\'[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]\'\'. The two found common ground both musically and politically and decided to collaborate on a project that would fuse elements of [[industrial music]] with [[hardcore punk]].<ref name="Pitchfork\'s Ministry interview">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Cosmo|title=Ministry|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6874-interview-ministry/|work=Interviews|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=17 June 2008}}</ref>

Pailhead released the single "I Will Refuse" / "No Bunny" (released in both 7" and 12" formats) in 1987 and the 4-song EP \'\'Trait\'\' in 1988, both on the Wax Trax! record label. The CD edition of \'\'Trait\'\' also incorporates both sides of the "I Will Refuse" / "No Bunny" single. The drummer for "No Bunny" was Eric Spicer of [[Naked Raygun]].<ref name=Prongs>{{cite web|title=Ministry \xe2\x80\x94 Pailhead|url=http://www.prongs.org/ministry/pail|publisher=prongs.org|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref>

These tracks were later re-released on Ministry\'s odds-and-ends compilation \'\'[[Side Trax]]\'\'.

==In popular culture==
* [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]]\'s first work with Al Jourgensen was to record vocals for the track that would later emerge as "I Will Refuse."  Connelly released this version, which he called "Stick" and attributed to the [[Revolting Cocks]], on his \'\'Initials C.C.\'\' album.  In his memoirs, he says he was not offended when MacKaye rerecorded the vocals with new lyrics, saying "It was an honor to be erased by Ian."
* The song "I Will Refuse" was used in the [[Zero Skateboards]] video, Misled Youth.
* In The Game [[Mat Hoffman\'s Pro BMX]]. Songs were also featured in the [[Streets on Fire]] skateboard video ([[Santa Cruz Skateboards]]). These songs included "Man Should Surrender", and "Don\'t Stand in Line".
* The song "I Will Refuse" was used in the premiere episode of [[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]\'s fourth season, "Rampage".
* "I Will Refuse" was covered by Soulfly and featured as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of their album, \'\'[[3 (Soulfly album)|3]].
* [[Spinnerette]]\'s cover version of "I Will Refuse" was released with their song "All Babes Are Wolves".

==Discography==
* \'\'I Will Refuse" b/w "No Bunny\'\' 7" and 12" single (1987)
* "Man Should Surrender" b/w "Anthem" 7" single (1988)
* "Don\'t Stand in Line" b/w "Ballad" 7" single (1988)
* \'\'[[Trait (album)|Trait]]\'\' 12" EP (comprising Pailhead\'s last two singles) and CD (made up of all 3 singles) (1988)

\'\'\'Pain\'\'\' (typeset as \'\'\'PAIN\'\'\') is a musical project from [[Sweden]] that mix [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with influences from [[electronic music]] and [[techno]]. The project started out as a hobby project for front man [[Peter T\xc3\xa4gtgren]], whose idea was to fuse heavy metal with 1980s-inspired [[electro-industrial]] and techno influences.

Pain\'s self-titled debut was released in 1997, and since then Pain has released six more albums and a DVD. Starting with their second, all of Pain\'s albums have made the Swedish charts, thanks in large part to hit singles such as "End of the Line", "Shut Your Mouth", and "Same Old Song".<ref name="charts">[http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Pain&titel=Rebirth&cat=a Pain in Swedish Charts], swedishcharts.com.</ref> In early February 2006, Blabbermouth.net reported that Pain had signed with [[Roadrunner Records]].

T\xc3\xa4gtgren received 10 stitches in his face, Wallin suffered a concussion and stitches to his head, and Husgafvel had his nose broken.<ref>[http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article1911474.ab Svenska Stj\xc3\xa4rnor Brutalt Nerslagna] from aftonbladet.se, \'\'accessed on 23 February 2008\'\'.</ref>

\'\'\'Pigface\'\'\' is an [[industrial rock]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in 1990 by [[Martin Atkins]] and [[William Rieflin]].<ref name="Buckley"/>

==History==
Pigface was formed from [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]\'s \'\'[[The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]\'\' tour,<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13950|pure_url=yes}} | title=Pigface Biography |last1=Prato |first1=Greg |last2=Erlewine |first2=Stephen Thomas | publisher = [[Allmusic]] |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> which produced the \'\'[[In Case You Didn\'t Feel Like Showing Up]]\'\' live album and video.  For the tour, [[Al Jourgensen]] brought Atkins, [[Nivek Ogre]] and [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]].  Also on the tour was Rieflin, regular Ministry drummer at the time.  While Atkins enjoyed the dynamic of playing with a second drummer, he felt that the lineup was capable of doing much more than being, what he has frequently called, "a Ministry cover band."  Once the tour was over, Atkins and Rieflin decided to continue working together and recruited several of their tourmates from \'\'The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste\'\' tour.  Pigface was born with the intention of keeping a revolving-door style collaboration with many experimentally-minded musicians, many of whom, especially early on, had recorded for the influential [[industrial music]] record label [[Wax Trax!]].

[[Trent Reznor]] was also an early partner, before [[Nine Inch Nails]] became a household name.  "Suck", co-written and sung by Reznor, was something of an underground hit, and Reznor later re-recorded the song for the \'\'[[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|Broken]]\'\' EP.

Rieflin eventually left Pigface, leaving Atkins in charge.  The hundreds of musical collaborators to record and perform with Pigface have ensured that each album, and each song, is unique.  However, this practice has led to some negative criticism due to a perceived lack of continuity.

In 2009, Full Effect Records, a Detroit-based label, announced the signing of Pigface.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=43191_0_2_0_C Pigface return with \'6\']</ref> The Pigface album, \'\'[[6 (Pigface album)|6]]\'\', followed shortly after.

==Live shows==
Pigface concerts are characterized by high-energy performances. It is not unusual to see upwards of ten musicians on stage at any given time during a show. In addition, members of the audience have occasionally been invited on stage during the encore.

==Members==
The following is a partial list of musicians who have been Pigface members at one time in the band\'s history as well as some of the bands and acts they have been associated with before and after their time with Pigface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/officialpigface |title=Official MySpace Page: Pigface |last=Atkins |first=Martin |date=2007-10-05}}</ref>

\'\'\'Pop Will Eat Itself\'\'\' (also known as \'\'\'PWEI\'\'\' or \'\'\'The Poppies\'\'\') are an [[England|English]] [[alternative rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] formed in [[Stourbridge]] in 1986 with members from [[Birmingham]], [[Coventry]] and the [[Black Country]]. Initially known as a [[Grebo (music)|Grebo]] act, their style changed to incorporate [[sampling (music)|sample]] driven [[indie rock|indie]] and [[industrial rock]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book

Kill The Baddies!".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> After initially disbanding in 1996, and having a brief reformation in 2005, they issued their first release in more than five years in 2010.

==Early years: 1981\xe2\x80\x931988==
An early permutation of the band formed in 1981 under the name From Eden. Members included [[Clint Mansell]], Adam Mole, Chris Fradgley, Malcolm Treece and [[Miles Hunt]] (Treece and Hunt went on to form [[The Wonder Stuff]]). From Eden recruited [[Graham Crabb]] to replace Hunt on drums before splitting up.

Crabb, Mole and Mansell recruited Richard March and changed their band name to Wild and Wandering (known locally as Blind and Blundering because they always performed in an intoxicated state).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The name came from a [[Wasted Youth (British band)|Wasted Youth]] album under which one E.P. was released (\'2,000 Light Ales From Home\' on Iguana Records) before eventually becoming Pop Will Eat Itself in 1986.  The new name was taken from a quotation in an \'\'[[NME]]\'\' article on [[Jamie Wednesday]] by [[David Quantick]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

===First single: "Poppies Say Grrr!" and tour===
In 1986, the band released the "Poppies Say Grrr!" [[single (music)|single]] which became the \'Single Of The Week\' in the \'\'NME\'\' and playlisted by [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

With their newfound popularity the band set off on a six-week tour of Europe, often encountering hostility at the set length being less than half an hour, even though this comprised around 16 tracks - all the band had.

===Influences===
During this time the band were listening to more and more [[hip hop]] ([[Run DMC]], [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[The Beastie Boys]]) as well as music from a new emerging movement of sample-heavy dance records ([[The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu]], [[MARRS]], [[S\'Express]] and [[Bomb The Bass]]).

After hearing Robert Gordon\'s remix of their cover of Sigue Sigue Sputnik\'s \'Love Misslie F1-11\' and Age Of Chance\'s mini LP \'Crush Collision\' (also engineered by Gordon), the band glimpsed their future as hip hop/dance/rock music pioneers and decided to record their debut album \'Box Frenzy\' with Robert at Sheffield\'s FON studios in June/July 1987. It was here the band met [[The Designers Republic]], which was to be the start of a very successful partnership. The album came out on manager Craig Jennings\' Chapter 22 label. \'CJ\' still manages the band to the present day along with his impressive roster at Raw Power Management.

The transition from punky guitar music to incorporating state-of-the-art production and new musical territories was not dissimilar to a path previously trodden by one of the band\'s musical heroes [[The Clash]] and subsequently [[Big Audio Dynamite]]. The album surprised the band\'s fans and perplexed the music critics. Crabb, now more immersed in sample-finding and songwriting, moved from behind the drum kit to being a co-vocalist with Mansell and was replaced by a [[drum machine]] called \'Dr. Nightmare\'.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> March took on programming duties and became the band expert on all things Atari and Akai. "Beaver Patrol", a cover of the Wilde Knights song, (suggested to the band by Bobbie Gillespie of Primal Scream), caused some controversy for its offensive lyrics but "There Is No Love Between Us Anymore" made the lower reaches of the UK charts and as a result, PWEI were signed to the [[record label]]  [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Whilst much scratching of heads ensued around the dramatic change of direction, PWEI secured a first by being the first Western independent band to be invited to play the then [[Soviet Union]] <ref name="Guinness Rockopedia" /><ref name="NME Rock N Roll Years">{{cite book

===Chart success===
The band achieved [[Top 40]] [[hit record|hits]] with "[[Can U Dig It?]]" and "[[Wise Up! Sucker]]" from their [[album]], \'\'[[This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!]]\'\'<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In late 1988 PWEI were invited by Rush Management to support Run DMC on their European tour. Main support act Public Enemy were becoming increasingly popular and had a large and militant following who booed off all support acts, in particular PWEI, who agreed to leave the tour when the situation deteriorated in [[Amsterdam]].

==The RCA years: 1989\xe2\x80\x931993==
They released three successful albums on RCA. The first two (\'\'\xe2\x80\xa6This is This!\'\' and \'\'Cure for Sanity\'\') were recorded with the aid of [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], known for his work with [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[U2]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. The band toured extensively in the UK, Europe, and US, including appearances at Reading Festival. Their singles charted progressively higher, with every single release charting inside the UK Top Forty from 1990 until their final single release in 1994.

On 1992\'s \'\'[[The Looks or the Lifestyle?]]\'\' the band recruited [[Robert "Fuzz" Townshend]] as their drummer to complement their standard array of loops and pre-programmed drums. The band had discussed adding a live drummer in 1990, however touring commitments made it impractical to do so until the band were able to break touring activity in late 1991 to commence recording.  The album peaked at UK No.&nbsp;15, and featured the Top 30 hit singles "Karmadrome" and "Bulletproof!"<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

Kill the Baddies!" single was released.  It went on to peak at number 9 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming the band\'s biggest hit, and making the band at that time the highest charting act to appear on Top of The Pops without a record deal. In an attempt to recoup their investment, the label released a live album "Live At Weird\'s Bar And Grill" recorded in London in October 1992.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==Industrial influence: 1994\xe2\x80\x931995==
In 1994, RCA agreed to write off the debts that the band had accumulated in [[recording studio]] fees in return for PWEI (Pop Will Eat Itself)\'s back catalogue.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} They signed a [[recording contract]] with Infectious Records, a label initiated by their friend Korda Marshell, who had signed them to RCA, but had since left the label.

PWEI\'s political stance became more explicit with the release of the single "[[Ich Bin Ein Auslander]]". A collaboration with Asian group [[Fun-Da-Mental]], the song had anti-nazi styled [[lyrics]] and reached the UK Top 30.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> A different version of this song later appeared as the opening track on the 1994 album, \'\'[[Dos Dedos Mis Amigos]]\'\'. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and spawned their then final single release, "[[Everything\'s Cool (song)|Everything\'s Cool]]", which became their ninth Top 30 UK hit.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band found some new popularity after signing with [[Trent Reznor]]\'s [[Nothing Records]] in the [[United States|US]], and touring with [[Nine Inch Nails]], as well as having their songs used on the [[PlayStation]] game \'\'[[Loaded (video game)|Loaded]]\'\'. In March 1995 the band released the \'\'Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\'\' [[remix]] album \'\'[[Two Fingers My Friends!]]\'\' which featured remixes by [[The Orb]], [[Apollo 440]] and [[Renegade Soundwave]].  Crabb left the band in Summer 1995 - originally proposing to contribute in a non-touring capacity due to fatherhood - however the band decided to replace him with Kerry Hammond on guitar and backing vocals, with Mansell taking over full vocal duties. The band decided to split in May 1996, (with 12 songs recorded and mixed in a state of near completion), and toured the UK briefly in June 1996 with a final live show at Roskilde. At this point, their set contained several unreleased songs from the unfinished album. Two tracks from this period were released at the time, a [[cover version]] of [[Gary Numan]]\'s "Friends".,<ref>[http://www.beggars.com/artists/catalogue/random/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> and an instrumental track called "Zero Return" on a magazine sampler.  In 2013, the songs from the unfinished album were assembled into a bonus disc with the reissue of "Dos Dedos Mis Amigos", comprising the \'unreleased 1996 album\', now titled "[[A Lick of the Old Cassette Box|A Lick Of The Old Cassette Box]]".

Almost all artwork and corporate identity for the band\'s record sleeves and merchandising were designed by the Sheffield based, now defunct design house The Designers Republic. The Designers Republic\'s work with PWEI can be found in the [[Design Museum]], London.

==Vestan Pance==
All PWEI songs were credited to Vestan Pance. It was a [[pseudonym]] for the band as a whole. Although the songs were mainly Crabb or Mansell compositions, using a pseudonym was considered more interesting than just "All songs by Pop Will Eat Itself". When Townshend joined the band, an attempt to change the name to \'Vestan Pance and Socks\' was denied by RCA.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Ankeny |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pop-will-eat-itself-mn0000852810/biography |title=Pop Will Eat Itself &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

==Disbanded: 1996==
Crabb concentrated on his [[Ambient music|ambient]] side project [[Golden Claw Musics]]. After the rest of the band split in 1996, March and Townshend went on to form the [[big beat]] band [[Bentley Rhythm Ace]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Townshend also released two solo albums and Mansell wrote a number of [[film]] scores, including \'\'[[Requiem for a Dream]]\'\', \'\'[[Pi (film)|\xcf\x80]]\'\', \'\'[[Doom (film)|Doom]]\'\',  \'\'[[The Fountain (film)|The Fountain]]\'\', \'\'[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]\'\', \'\'[[Moon (film)|Moon]]\'\', and \'\'[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]\'\'.

==Reformation: 2005==
The band reformed to play their first gigs in eight years, in Nottingham, Birmingham, and London in January 2005. These gigs were notable for their [[Instant Live]] albums, whereby ten minutes after the completion of each gig, [[double album|double]] [[live album]]s of the performance could be purchased.

The band released a preview of new material called \'Sonic Noise Byte\' on 4 November 2005, as a torrent download for members of their official website pweination. However, an announcement on the official website in March 2006 confirmed that Mansell and March would no longer be involved in the project due to other work commitments, effectively ending the PWEI reformation. However the remaining band members continued as [[Vileevils]], and released the tracks "Retro Dreaming" and "Street Fightin" for download via the pweination website.

A secret, one-night PWEI reunion was scheduled to happen at the Vileevils show at Stourbridge Rock Cafe on 9 June 2007, but was foiled when Mansell was unable to obtain a visa in time to fly back to the UK.<ref>[http://pweination.co.uk/newnation/comms/index.php?showtopic=5385&st=180&p=43451&#entry43451]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>  March still appeared at the show, and after the Vileevils set they played the planned PWEI songs, sans Mansell.

Vileevils performed their final live date in December 2008 supporting Ned\'s Atomic Dustbin, before recording an unreleased album, which was cancelled prior to release in 2010. Some songs from this record were re-recorded for the 2011 Pop Will Eat Itself album \'\'New Noise Designed By A Sadist\'\', whilst others remain unreleased to date.

==New PWEI: 2011\xe2\x80\x93present==
In July 2011, a new line-up was announced, featuring Graham Crabb (as the only original member), fellow vocalist Mary Byker ([[Gaye Bykers on Acid]], [[Apollo 440]], [[Pigface]]), guitarist Tim Muddiman ([[Gary Numan]]), drummer Jason Bowld ([[Pitchshifter]], [[Killing Joke]]) and bassist Davey Bennett ([[This Burning Age]]). The new lineup was initially controversial with some fans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} 
In October that year the album, \'\'New Noise Designed By A Sadist\'\', was released on Cooking Vinyl, produced by Monti & Rob Holliday ([[Sulpher]], [[The Prodigy]]) and was followed by a UK tour. The band further toured in March and December 2012. 
The single \'Disguise\' was featured as Radio 6 Breakfast Show \'Single of the Week\' and an instrumental \'Back To Business\' was used on [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]. Crabb & Byker also guested on [[Soccer AM]]. The band began working on a remix album to complement \'\'New Noise Designed By A Sadist\'\', but this project was discontinued in favour of the \'\'Watch The Bitch Blow\'\' EP. They toured the UK in December 2013 as one third of a triple bill featuring [[The Wonder Stuff]] and [[Jesus Jones]].

The \'\'Watch The Bitch Blow\'\' EP was released in March, 2014, through [[PledgeMusic]], and the \'\'Relcaim The Game (Funk FIFA)\'\' single, featuring the Brazilian rapper BNeg\xc3\xa3o ([[Planet Hemp]]), was released in June 2014 for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], as a protest song against FIFA. Another LP was planned for release in September-October, but the release date was pushed back several times. It was finally released independently through their website in April 2015. An extensive UK tour will accompany the release in May and other shows are also planned for USA later in the year.

==History==

===Founding and \'\'Herzeleid\'\' (1989-1996)===
[[File:Rammstein (5424003413).jpg|thumb|right|Richard Kruspe, (pictured) one of the founding members of Rammstein]]
Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to [[West Berlin]] and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmicks. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially that of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. After the [[Berlin Wall]] came down, he moved back home to [[Schwerin]], where Till Lindemann worked as a basket-weaver and played drums in the band First Arsch (loosely translated as "First Ass" or "First Arse"). At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and Christoph "Doom" Schneider (of Die Firma). Richard had come to the realization that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him. He envisioned something that would combine machines as well as the sound of hard guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time and persuaded Lindemann, whom he had overheard singing while he was working, to join Rammstein.

The band was named after the [[Ramstein air show disaster]].<ref>Ronald Galenza, Heinz Havemeister: Feeling B. Mix mir einen Drink. \xe2\x80\x93 p. 262. Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf, Berlin 2002, ISBN 3-89602-418-3</ref> At first, the band had denied this and said that their name was inspired by the giant doorstop type devices found on old gates, called Rammsteine.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK8EQqH1IM8 "Rammstein-Who Are They?." Interview with bands. JAM. VIVA JAM Interview: Berlin, Germany 1997. Video. 08:17]</ref> The extra "m" in the band\'s name makes it translate literally as "ramming stone".

A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four-track demo CD in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel, and Lindemann entered and won the contest, which sparked the attention of Paul H. Landers, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit Christian "Flake" Lorenz, who had played with Landers in Feeling B. At first, Lorenz was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band. Later, they were signed by Motor Records.

Rammstein began to record their first studio album, \'\'[[Herzeleid]]\'\', in March 1995 with producer [[Jacob Hellner]].<ref>{{cite web

Later that year, they toured with [[Clawfinger]] in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from 2 December to 22 December consisting of 17 shows, which did much to boost the band\'s popularity and establish them as a credible live act. They went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single titled "[[Seemann]]" on 8 January of that year.

On 27 March 1996, Rammstein performed on [[MTV]]\'s \'\'Hanging Out\'\' in London, their first performance in the UK. Rammstein\'s first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when music director [[Trent Reznor]] chose two Rammstein songs, "Heirate mich" and "[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]", for [[David Lynch]]\'s film \'\'[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]\'\'. The soundtrack for the film was released in the U.S. in late 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997.

Rammstein went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called "100 years of Rammstein". Guests to the concert included [[Moby]], [[Bobo (singer)|Bobo]] and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.

===\'\'Sehnsucht\'\' and \'\'Live aus Berlin\'\' (late 1996\xe2\x80\x932000)===
Rammstein started recording \'\'[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]\'\' in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.rammstein.com/_Voelkerball/Band/Timeline/T1996/| title = Rammstein :: Band :: Timeline| accessdate = 2008-06-21

"[[Engel (song)|Engel]]", the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named \'\'Engel - Fan Edition\'\'. This contained two previously unreleased songs, "Feuerr\xc3\xa4der" and "Wilder Wein". Release of the second single from the album \'\'Sehnsucht\'\' was "[[Du hast]]", which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5.
Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while \'\'Sehnsucht\'\' was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, \'\'Herzeleid\'\' and both \'\'Sehnsucht\'\' singles ("Du hast" and "Engel") were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for [[KMFDM]].

On 22\xe2\x80\x9323 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Joachim Witt]] and [[Alaska (singer)|Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rammstein.de/en/rammstein| title = History-Rammstein| accessdate = 2015-03-26  | publisher = Rammstein.de |archiveurl =

|archivedate = 2015-03-26}}</ref> The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming [[Live album|live]] DVD, \'\'[[Live aus Berlin]]\'\'.

Rammstein embarked on a live tour with [[Korn]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] called the [[Family Values Tour]] in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, \'\'Sehnsucht\'\' received Gold record status there on 2 November.

The band was nominated at the [[MTV European Music Awards]] for \'\'Best Rock Act\'\' and performed "Du hast" live on 12 November that year.

Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for \'\'Best Metal Performance\'\' at the 41st-annual [[Grammy Awards]]. A year after it was filmed, the \'\'Live aus Berlin\'\' concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, \'\'Live aus Berlin\'\' went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.  Further popularity ensued with the inclusion of "[[Du hast]]" in \'\'[[The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture]]\'\'.

===\'\'Mutter\'\' (2000\xe2\x80\x932002)===
Rammstein\'s album \'\'[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]\'\' was recorded in the south of France in May and June 2000, and mixed in [[Stockholm]] in October of that year. During December 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 version of "[[Links 2-3-4]]" as a teaser for their new album.

2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, starting in January and February with the band playing the [[Big Day Out]] festival in Australia and New Zealand. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single, "[[Sonne (Rammstein song)|Sonne]]", recorded in [[Potsdam]] at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13 to 15 January 2001. The video was released on 29 January 2001. The single for "Sonne" was released on 12 February 2001 in Europe, featuring an instrumental version of the song, two remixes by [[Clawfinger]] and the song "Adios" from the upcoming album.

\'\'Mutter\'\' was released on 2 April 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On 14 May, the second single from the album, "Links 2 3 4", was released, along with a video of the single on 18 May. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June to August 2001.

"[[Ich will]]", the third single from the album, was released on 10 September 2001 and a Tour edition of the \'\'Mutter\'\' album (the cover of which is red)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gidipi.com/Mutter-Limited-Tour-Edition-2001-2-CD_30.html |title=Mutter Limited Tour Edition 2001 - 2 CD - Rammstein &#124; Download Rapidshare Megaupload Hotfile Music |publisher=gidipi |date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of "Ich will", "Links 2 3 4", "Sonne" and "Spieluhr".

From 8 to 12 January 2002, Rammstein traveled to Prague to participate in a minor scene for the film \'\'[[xXx (film)|xXx]]\'\'. The band is seen in the opening scene, performing their song "[[Feuer frei!]]" in a concert. "Feuer frei!" was released across Europe as the first single from the \'\'xXx\'\' soundtrack on 14 October 2002. Rammstein released two remixes of the song. Furthermore, the single\'s track listing included "Du hast" and "B\xc3\xbcck dich" cover versions by [[Battery (band)|Battery]]. The video for the single was edited by Rob Cohen and contains part Rammstein performance at the beginning of the film and part snippets from the film itself.

===\'\'Reise, Reise\'\' (2003\xe2\x80\x932005)===
Rammstein recorded \'\'[[Reise, Reise]]\'\' (meaning "journey journey", but [[Reveille#Germany|also an archaic Reveille]]) at the El Cortijo studio in southern Spain in November and December 2003; it was mixed at Toytown studio in Stockholm, Sweden in April and May 2004. The first single from the album was "[[Mein Teil]]", released on 26 July. The video was shot in the Arena, in the Treptow district of Berlin. Outdoor shooting took place at the Deutsche Oper (Opera House) [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station on Bismarckstrasse. The director was Zoran Bihac, who also filmed the "Links 2 3 4" video.

The video for the second single, "[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]", was filmed on 6 and 7 August 2004 in the ruins of the former cement works in [[R\xc3\xbcdersdorf]], near Berlin, under the direction of J\xc3\xb6rn Heitmann (who also directed the "Ich Will" music video, among others). The space suits for the moon scenes were borrowed from Hollywood and 240 tons of ash were needed to create the moon landscape. The video premiered on 20 August, while the single was released on 13 September.

\'\'Reise, Reise\'\' was released on 27 September 2004 and went straight into top 10 charts throughout Europe. According to the Billboard charts, Rammstein were at that stage the most successful German-language band of all time. Rammstein toured Germany through November and some of December 2004, releasing the single "[[Ohne dich]]" on 22 November.

In February 2005, Rammstein toured Europe again. By 28 February, Rammstein had played 21 concerts in front of more than 200,000 spectators in ten countries. It was on this tour that the band was faced with several lawsuits resulting from severe fire breathing accidents involving audience members. "[[Keine Lust]]" the fourth single from \'\'Reise, Reise\'\', was released on 28 February 2005.

From 27 May to 30 July 2005, Rammstein played music festivals across Europe. Footage from these concerts can be seen on Rammstein\'s live DVD \'\'[[V\xc3\xb6lkerball]]\'\', released in November 2006.

On November 8, 2009, Rammstein began the first leg of the [[Liebe ist f\xc3\xbcr alle da Tour]] in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the [[Rock am Ring and Rock im Park|2010 Rock AM Ring Festival]] on 4\xe2\x80\x936 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/rammstein-confirmed-for-rock-am-ring/ |title=Rammstein confirmed for Rock am Ring |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Metalhammer.co.uk |accessdate= }}</ref> They also headlined several shows across Europe on the [[Sonisphere Festival]], including their first ever outdoor UK performance at [[Knebworth Park]], performing the day before [[Iron Maiden]]. On Sunday July 18, 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in [[Quebec City]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] as the closing show for the [[Festival d\'\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 de Qu\xc3\xa9bec]]. It was their first North American appearance in 9 years. The band announced that their last tour dates of 2010 were to be in the Americas. After several South American dates, the band returned to the United States for a single show at the famous [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] \xe2\x80\x93 their first US show in over nine years. The tickets sold out in a very short time. They also performed at [[Bell Centre]] in Montreal, Canada on December 9. This concert sold out within the first hour of tickets going on sale, indicating a high demand to see Rammstein in North America. The band then played at Big Day Out 2011 from January 21 to February 6 in New Zealand and Australia. The band also visited South Africa for the first time in early 2011 and played two sold-out concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg respectively, indicating another territory eager for the opportunity to enjoy the band live. On February 16, 2011, Rammstein announced that, after the massive success of their sold out [[Madison Square Garden]] show on December 11, 2010, they would be touring North America after 10 years, stopping in New Jersey (East Rutherford) [[Izod Center]], Montreal [[Bell Centre]], Toronto [[Air Canada Centre]], Chicago [[Allstate Arena]], Edmonton [[Rexall Place]], Seattle [[Tacoma Dome]], San Francisco (Oakland) [[Oracle Arena]], Los Angeles [[The Forum (Inglewood)]], and Las Vegas [[Thomas and Mack Center]], Mexico City\'s [[Palacio de los Deportes]], Guadalajara\'s [[Arena VFG]], and Monterey\'s Auditorio Banamex to a total of six US dates, three Canadian dates, and four Mexican dates. Tickets went on sale February 25 and 26 to great response, with many shows completely selling out, making this tour a complete success. On April 20, 2011, the band also won the [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Golden God Award]] for Best Live Band, their first US award.

Rammstein released a greatest hits album titled \'\'[[Made in Germany 1995\xe2\x80\x932011]]\'\' on December 2, 2011. It contains one previously unreleased track, "[[Mein Land]]" which was released as a single on November 11, 2011 with another track, "Vergiss uns nicht", that was released at a later date. The compilation is available in three different editions: The standard edition; this includes a CD with normal songs from their back catalog. Special edition; has the same CD from the standard edition and an extra CD with Rammstein songs that have been remixed by different artists such as Scooter. Finally, the super deluxe edition; has the two previously mentioned CDs and 3 DVDs with interviews and the making of videos from different music videos.

The video for the song "[[Mein Land]]" was filmed on May 23, 2011 at Sycamore Beach in Malibu, California. It premiered on the band\'s official website on November 11, 2011. A full European tour in support of \'\'Made in Germany\'\' began on November 2011 and spanned all the way to May 2012. It included a North American tour that began on April 20, 2012 in Sunrise, Florida and ended on May 25, 2012 in Houston, Texas that visited 21 cities throughout the US and Canada. The Swedish industrial band [[Deathstars]] supported the band during the first two legs of the European tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rammstein.de/en/news/ankundigung-nord-amerika-tour-2012-en-announcement-north-american-tour-2012 |title=Ank\xc3\xbcndigung: Nord Amerika Tour 2012 \xc2\xab Rammstein |publisher=Rammstein.de |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}}</ref> DJ Joe Letz from Combichrist and Emigrate was the opening act for the North American Tour.

Although Rammstein is often categorised as [[Neue Deutsche H\xc3\xa4rte]] (New German Hardness), their music spans a variety of related styles, including [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[industrial music]], and [[groove metal]].

Rammstein\'s style has tended to divide critics. New Zealand\'s \'\'Southland Times\'\' (December 17, 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann\'s "booming, sub-sonic voice" would send "the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors", while the \'\'[[New York Times]]\'\' (January 9, 2005) commented that on the stage, "Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of \'\'[[AllMusic]]\'\' commented that "their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful."<ref name="Allmusic.com-sehnsucht">{{cite web| title =  Sehnsucht review| author = Stephen Thomas Erlewine| publisher = Allmusic| url = http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=A6s27gjyr16ix| accessdate = 2006-07-10}}{{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}</ref> "We just push boundaries", said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine \'\'[[Kerrang!]]\'\', "We can\'t help it if people don\'t like those boundaries being pushed."

==Lyrics==
[[File:Rammstein - 01.jpg|thumb|Rammstein performing [[Mein Teil]] in 2013, one of the tracks from [[Reise, Reise]]. The track is based on the events of [[Armin Meiwes|The Meiwes Case]].]]
Nearly all of Rammstein\'s songs are in German. However, the band has recorded English songs as well as a cover of the song "[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]" (Depeche Mode). In addition, the songs "Amerika", "Stirb nicht vor mir/Don\'t Die Before I Do," and "Pussy" contain lyrics in English. The song "[[Moskau (Rammstein song)|Moskau]]" ("Moscow") contains a chorus in Russian. "[[Te quiero puta]]!" is entirely in Spanish, and the song "Fr\xc3\xbchling in Paris" has a chorus in French. Oliver Riedel commented that "German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger."<ref>{{Cite news| title =\'\'Sunday Herald Sun\'\', Melbourne, Australia | publisher = Sunday Herald Sun}}</ref>

The band\'s lyrics, as sung by Till Lindemann, are an essential element of their music, and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. Among other things that are seen as controversial, Rammstein also refers to classical German literature, e.g. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\'s famous poems \'\'[[Der Erlk\xc3\xb6nig]]\'\' (1778) and \'\'[[Heidenr\xc3\xb6slein|Das Heidenr\xc3\xb6slein]]\'\' (1771) for the songs "Dalai Lama" and "Rosenrot", respectively.<ref>\'\'L\xc3\xbcke\'\', L\xc3\xbcke, Martina. "Modern Classics: Reflections on Rammstein in the German Class." Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German 41:1 (Spring 2008): 15-23.</ref>

Several of their songs are related to controversial and taboo subjects such as [[sadomasochism]], [[homosexuality]], [[intersex]]uality, [[incest]], [[pedophilia]], [[necrophilia]], [[cannibalism]], [[pyromania]], [[religion]] and [[sexual violence]]. Also several of their songs are allegedly inspired by real-life events. These songs include "Rammstein" ([[Ramstein airshow disaster]]), "Mein Teil" ([[Armin Meiwes|The Meiwes Case]]), "Wiener Blut" ([[Fritzl case]]) and "Donaukinder" ([[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill]]).

Wordplay is a fundamental component of Rammstein\'s lyrics. In many instances, the lyrics are phrased in such a way that they can be interpreted in several ways. The song "Du hast", for example, is a play on the German [[marriage]] vow \'\'Willst Du, bis der Tod euch scheidet, treu ihr sein f\xc3\xbcr alle Tage?\'\' ("Will you, until Death separates you, be faithful to her for the rest of your days?"). In the song, the traditional affirmative response, \'\'Ja\'\' ("Yes"), is replaced by its negation \'\'Nein\'\' ("No"). The song starts, in fact, with a play on words: \'\'Du... Du hast... Du hast mich...\'\' meaning "You have me". This line is often mistaken for "You hate me", because in German, there is no distinction between the pronunciation of \'\'Du hasst\'\' ("you hate") and \'\'Du hast\'\' ("you have"). The pun is later resolved as the sentence is completed: \'\'Du hast mich gefragt/Und ich hab\' nichts gesagt\'\' ("You [have] asked me/And I [have] said nothing"). Confusingly, the band did also make an English version of the song named "You Hate", which was not translated directly from "Du hast". While many arguments are made about "Du hast", it is known that Rammstein used this wording to intentionally mislead the listener and create humour in the song, causing many non-German speakers to be confused.

==Live performances==
[[File:Rammstein Nottingham.jpg|left|thumb|Rammstein are known for their frequent use of [[pyrotechnics]] during live performances.]]
Rammstein have achieved particular fame for their over-the-top stage show, making such extensive use of [[pyrotechnics]] that fans eventually coined the motto "Other bands play, Rammstein burns!" (a quip at [[Manowar (band)|Manowar\'s]] song "Kings of Metal", which states, "other bands play, Manowar kills"). Following an accident at the Arena in Berlin in which some burning decorative parts fell (27 September 1996)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://rammstein-europe.com/main.php?sekce=till-lindemann&l=en| title= Till Lindemann Biography| accessdate = 2007-05-10| publisher = Rammstein-Europe.com}}</ref> the band started using professionals to handle the pyrotechnics. Lindemann subsequently qualified as a licensed pyrotechnician; he spends entire songs engulfed head-to-toe in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head and arms.

The heat during live performances is so intense that on occasion, people have been carried out of concerts suffering from heat exhaustion, and lighting gantries have been seen glowing red-hot from repeated fireball hits.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The variety of the pyrotechnics can be seen in a recent concert playlist, which includes such items as "[[Lycopodium]] Masks", "Glitterburst Truss", "Pyrostrobes", "Comets", "Flash Trays" and "Mortar Hits".

The band\'s costumes are fittingly outlandish. During the \'\'Reise, Reise\'\' tour, they wore [[Lederhosen]], [[corset]]s and military-inspired uniforms with [[stahlhelm]]s, while during the \'\'Mutter\'\' tour the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant [[uterus]] while wearing diapers. In the \'\'V\xc3\xb6lkerball\'\' concert, among others, Till changed costumes between songs, dressed accordingly for each. For example, in "Mein Teil", he was dressed as a butcher, in "Reise, Reise", as a sailor. The rest of the band each wore their own preferred costume, but none quite as bizarre as Till\'s. The band\'s flair for costumes is evident in their music videos as well as their live shows. In the "Keine Lust" video, all members except Lorenz are dressed in fat suits. In the "Amerika" video, all members of the band wear astronaut costumes.
 
[[File:Till-Lindemann.jpg|thumb|Vocalist [[Till Lindemann]] during "[[Rammstein (song)|Rammstein]]", known for wearing dual arm mounted flame throwers.]]
Since the Mutter Tour, starting in 2001, Rammstein have worked with stage designer Roy Bennett, who helped the band in developing the look of the stages. With the Reise, Reise Tour (2004/2005), the band began using a two-level stage, with half the band playing the lower level, as the other half was placed at the upper. At this tour, the upper level rose over 2 metres above the stage floor and had an oval entrance just beneath the drums. At both sides of the upper level, a special lift made it possible for the band members to access both stage levels. On the \'\'Liebe ist f\xc3\xbcr alle da\'\' Tour (starting 2009), the new stage still had a two-level design. This time, however, the upper level only had about half the height as on the previous tour. Stage entrance was possible by a hydraulic ramp in the middle of the stage floor. At each end of the upper level, stairs are placed in order to gain access to both levels.

This tour included not only the extensive use of pyrotechnics, but also a massive lighting show, such as the famous band logo-cross as big lamps and four enormous collapsible towers, forming the industrial backdrop of the set, capable of doing different lighting effects. According to Kruspe, the on-stage wackiness is entirely deliberate (Rammstein\'s motto according to Schneider is: "Do your own thing. And overdo it!"). The aim is to get people\'s attention and have fun at the same time.

Their onstage antics have also got them in trouble. During their stint on the American Family Values Tour 1998, alongside acts such as rapper [[Ice Cube (rapper)|Ice Cube]], [[Korn]], Limp Bizkit and Orgy, the band was arrested for indecency. In one of the more infamous moments vocalist Till Lindemann engaged in simulated [[sodomy]] with keyboardist Lorenz during their performance of "B\xc3\xbcck dich" in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were subsequently arrested and fined $25 and spent one night in jail.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kratina|first=Al|title=Concert review: Rammstein|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/Concert+review+Rammstein/3959185/story.html|accessdate=22 December 2010|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=December 10, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Steffen|first=Chris|title=Behind the Scenes: Rammstein Live|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/behind-scenes-rammstein-live|accessdate=22 December 2010|newspaper=Spin|date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> The band attempted to appeal the fine, and spent more in legal fees and court fees than the $25 fine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Band longevity==
Since their formation in 1994, Rammstein has had no changes in their line-up. Richard Kruspe had said in a \'\'Revolver Magazine\'\' interview that it is because of the band respecting each other\'s wishes to take a break; either for personal reasons or to focus on a side project.

{{quotation|Rammstein follow their own rhythm. We never give a shit about the people who think we need to get a record out every two years and that\'s one of the reasons why we\'re still together with the same lineup. We take care of each other, and if somebody needs to take the time off or do something else, we listen.|Richard Z. Kruspe, <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wiederhorn|first1=Jon|title=The Brutal Truth: Emigrate|journal=Revolver Magazine|date=2015|issue=119|page=41|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>}}

==Controversies==

===Imagery===
\'\'The New York Times\'\' described Rammstein\'s music as a "powerful strain of brutally intense rock... bringing gale-force music and spectacular theatrics together".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=184439| title= NYTimes Movies| accessdate = 2007-04-10| publisher = New York Times Corporation| first=Manohla| last=Dargis}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> The members have not been shy about courting controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from [[morality]] campaigners. Till and Flake\'s stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting [[dildo]] was used in a concert in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Back home in Germany, the band has faced repeated accusations of [[fascism|fascist]] sympathies because of the dark and sometimes [[Militarism|militaristic]] imagery of their videos and concerts, including the use of excerpts from the film \'\'[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]\'\' by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in the video for the Depeche Mode cover "Stripped". [[MTV Germany]] studied the lyrics, talked to the band and came away satisfied that Rammstein are apolitical; [[Peter Ruppert]], then head of Music Programming at MTV Germany, stated that the band "aren\'t in any way connected with any right-wing activities". Such criticism may be unavoidable for a German band that deals in harsh, militaristic-style imagery.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.helnwein.com/news/update/artikel_3108.html| title= German Band\'s Fierce Songs Taking US by Storm (Press)| accessdate = 1998-08-21| publisher = Helnwein.com}}</ref>

Their cover of their debut album \'\'Herzeleid\'\', released in Germany in 1995, showed the band members bare-chested in a style that resembled [[Strength Through Joy]] in the eyes of some critics, who accused the band of trying to sell themselves as "poster boys for the [[Master Race]]".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/band| title= Herzeleid.com (FAQ)| accessdate = 2007-04-10| publisher = Herzeleid.com}}</ref> Rammstein have vehemently denied this and said they want nothing to do with politics or supremacy of any kind. Lorenz, annoyed by the claim, has remarked it is just a photo, and should be understood as such. \'\'Herzeleid\'\' has since been given a different cover in North America, depicting the band members\' faces. The clip for the song "Amerika" shows people from different nationalities throughout the video and Rammstein members taking photographs with them at the end of the clip.

The song "[[Links 2-3-4]]" (\'\'Links\'\' being German for "left") was written as a riposte to these claims. Kruspe said: {{"\'}}My heart beats on the left, two, three, four\'. It\'s simple. If you want to put us in a political category, we\'re on the left side, and that\'s the reason we made the song".<ref>{{Cite news| title= \'\'The Grand Rapids Press\'\'| publisher = Grand Rapids Press}}</ref>

According to the German online music magazine laut.de,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Rammstein/Das-Herz-schlaegt-links,-oder/14-12-2000 |title=Das Herz schl\xc3\xa4gt links, oder? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Laut.de |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Rammstein, with this song, positioned themselves on the side of [[Oskar Lafontaine]], co-chairmen of [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] Party and former chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], who had used the expression "the heart beats left" before. They write:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2000/12/14/01319/index.htm |title=Rammstein: Das Herz schl\xc3\xa4gt links, oder? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Laut.de  |accessdate=8 September 2010}} This song is in fact written by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and composed by [[Hanns Eisler]] in 1934. The full text can be found here: "[http://www.ewo2.de/schlauch-live/texte_07.htm Einheitsfrontlied]"</ref>

{{quotation|Rammstein embed the Lafontaine saying "My heart beats left" into their lyric and cite a line of the  workers\' song "Einheitsfrontlied" from [[Berthold Brecht]] ("\'\'Left, 2, 3, 4; left 2, 3, 4\'\'; where your place is [[comrade]], line up into the Workers\' [[United Front]], if you are a worker").}}

Lorenz stated that the song was created to show the band could write a harsh, evil, military-sounding song without being [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://herzeleid.com/en/press/2005-11_flake_chat_english| title= Herzeleid.com (Press)| accessdate = 2007-04-10| publisher = Herzeleid.com}}</ref>

===Relation to violent events===
Rammstein were cited in relation to the [[Columbine High School massacre|shootings in Columbine]] Massacre in 1999, when a photo of Eric Harris wearing a Rammstein T-shirt were revealed in his 11th grade picture and wrote the Rammstein logo on a yearbook he signed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://acolumbinesite.com/eric/pics/ericramm11th.jpg|title = Eric Harris wearing a Rammstein T-shirt|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Though there was no evidence to correlate the band and the massacre. In response to the shooting, the band issued a statement:

{{quotation|The members of Rammstein express their condolences and sympathy to all affected by the recent tragic events in Denver. They wish to make it clear that they have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behaviour. Additionally, members of Rammstein have children of their own, in whom they continually strive to instill healthy and non-violent values.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://herzeleid.com/en/faq/misc|title = Did Rammstein\'s music cause Columbine?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427256/kmfdm-rammstein-speak-out-about-columbine.jhtml</ref>}}

Coincidentally, on September 10, 2001 the single and video clip of Ich will ("I Want") was released which portrays the band as bank robbers who want to get a message across and receiving a Goldene Kamera (Golden Camera) award, a German version of the Emmy award, for their "actions". In the United States, the video clip was broadcast only late at night after the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York City although many media officials and politicians requested the video to be pulled from broadcast completely.

Following the conclusion of the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] in Russia in September 2004, the Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had "listened to German hard rock group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up".<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=3601635|title = Beslan hostage-takers were all addicts says top Russian official|last = |first = |date = Oct 18, 2004|work = |accessdate = }}</ref> The claim has not been independently confirmed.

Band members said this about the issue:

{{quotation|There\'s been a lot of talk about that, but if there are radical feelings in people anything can wake them \xe2\x80\x93 a painting, a picture, whatever. It\'s just a coincidence that it happened to be our music. It\'s important to think about what caused them to make their decisions, how they became animals, not their taste in music. Whenever something like this happens it\'s like "Okay, let\'s blame the artist". Such bullshit.|||Till Lindemann|=}}

{{quotation|Our music is made to release aggression, and people listening to it are also needed to do that, but it\'s not our fault. Should we stop making hard music because bad people might like it?|||Christoph Schneider|=}}

Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the perpetrator of the [[Jokela school shooting]] in November 2007, also included Rammstein in one of his favorite bands. However, he noted that the music among other things was not to blame for his decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://oddculture.com/the-pekka-eric-auvinen-manifesto/|title = The Pekka Eric Auvinen Manifesto|date = November 7, 2007|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

Furthermore, Elliot Rodger, the perpetrator of the [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]] in May 2014, was also a fan of Rammstein according to his YouTube records. On a lyric video of [[Mein Herz brennt]], Rodger wrote "great song to listen to while daydreaming about being a powerful ruler." Even though Rodger wrote in his manifesto that he wished to become a dictator and punish all the people who rejected him, there was no direct link found between the band\'s music and the mass killing.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1173808-elliot-rodger-manifesto.html/| title=My Twisted World The Story of Elliot Rodger|date = May 23, 2014|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Santa Barbara police later confirmed that Rodger\'s main motivations were sexual and social rejection.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/26/justice/california-elliot-rodger-timeline/|title = Timeline to \'Retribution\': Isla Vista attacks planned over year| date = May 27, 2014|accessdate = |website = www.cnn.com|publisher = Alan Duke|last = |first = }}</ref>

===Videos===
In October 2004, the video for "[[Mein Teil]]" ("My part") caused considerable controversy in Germany when it was released. It takes a darkly comic view of the [[Armin Meiwes]] cannibalism case, showing a [[Cross dressing|cross-dressed]] [[Christoph Schneider|Schneider]] holding the other five band members on a leash and rolling around in mud. The controversy did nothing to stop the single rising to No.&nbsp;2 in the German charts. Meiwes (who was convicted of manslaughter in 2004, then retried in 2006 and found guilty of murder)<ref name="UPI-miewes-20060509">{{cite web| title = \'Rotenburg cannibal\' sentenced to life| publisher = United Press International| date = 2006-05-09| url = http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060509-120534-3022r| accessdate = 2006-07-10}}</ref> brought a lawsuit in January 2006 against the band for infringement of rights to the story.

The band\'s own views of its image are sanguine; Landers has said: "We like being on the fringes of bad taste".<ref>{{cite news |last= Smyth|first= David|date= 10 February 2012|title= Flame and glory: Rammstein set to light up London |url= http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/flame-and-glory-rammstein-set-to-light-up-london-7441820.html|newspaper= [[London Evening Standard]]|location= |accessdate= 21 January 2015}}</ref> Christian "Flake" Lorenz comments: "The controversy is fun, like stealing forbidden fruit. But it serves a purpose.

The video for "Pussy" was released September 2009. It features graphic scenes of [[nudity]] along with women engaging in sexual activity with body doubles of the band members. It is the third Rammstein video to include nudity.<ref>{{cite web| title = Rammstein\'s Pussy Released In Mucky Vid| publisher = The Quietus| date = 2009-09-17| url = http://mp-3.net.ua/mysik/rock/930-rammstein-pussy.html| accessdate = 2009-09-17}}</ref>

===Placement on the \'\'Index\'\'===
On November 5, 2009, their sixth studio album, <!-- This capitalization is correct, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums#Capitalization -->\'\'[[Liebe ist f\xc3\xbcr alle da]]\'\', was placed on the \'\'Index\'\' of the [[Bundespr\xc3\xbcfstelle f\xc3\xbcr jugendgef\xc3\xa4hrdende Medien]] or BPjM (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons), making it illegal in Germany to make the album accessible to minors or display it where it can be seen by people underage, effectively banning it from stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/Rammstein?v=feed&story_fbid=192292340906 |title=Statement of the band on Facebook |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=1693 |title=Report |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Schnittberichte.com |accessdate= }}</ref> According to the official statement of the BPjM, the depiction of lead guitarist Richard Kruspe holding a woman wearing only a mask over his knee and lifting his hand to strike her behind has given cause for offense, as well as the lyrics to "Ich tu dir weh" which supposedly assist to spread dangerous [[BDSM]] techniques. Furthermore, the advisory board has taken into consideration the alleged promotion of unprotected sexual intercourse in the lyrics to "Pussy". The band, as well as several members of the German press, reacted with astonishment to the decision. Keyboardist Christian Lorenz expressed surprise at the advisory board\'s "parochial sense of art" and regretted their apparent inability to detect irony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/469/493812/text/ |title=Liebe ist nicht f\xc3\xbcr alle da |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sueddeutsche.de |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2009/11/11/23636/index.htm |title=Rammstein-Zensur: Mit Fleischgewehren auf Spatzen |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Laut.de |accessdate=8 September 2010|language=de}}</ref> On November 16, 2009, a stripped down version of <!-- This capitalization is correct, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums#Capitalization -->\'\'Liebe ist f\xc3\xbcr alle da\'\' was released. As of May 31, 2010, the administrative court in Cologne has decided to waive the suspensive effect of the inclusion into the \'\'Index\'\' (case 22 L 1899/09). The German department deleted the record from the \'\'Index\'\' on June 1 (Decision No.&nbsp;A 117/10). On June 9, the band announced on their official website that the original version of the album was already available at their shop and that a release of the single "Ich tu dir weh" in Germany was planned in a short period of time. In October 2011, the offending song was removed from the Index by a court ruling in Cologne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/10/german-court-rules-sado-music-not-harmful-to-youth.html |title=German court rules sado music \xe2\x80\x98not harmful\xe2\x80\x99 to youth |publisher=Artsjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref>

===Purported legal action===
In 2010, Rammstein settled out of court against [[Apocalyptica]]\'s former record label [[Sony Music|Sony Music Entertainment GmbH]] as the successor of the by now defunct affiliated label Gun Records for using Rammstein\'s label in marketing Apocalyptica\'s 2007 album \'\'[[Worlds Collide]]\'\', which featured a duet with singer Lindemann.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apocalyptica.com/uk/news/correction-reg-wrong-infromation-about-settlement |title=CORRECTION REG.

The legal action apparently did no harm to the relationship between the bands, since Apocalyptica were seen on stage with Rammstein during the song "Mein Herz brennt" in February 2012 at Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland.

\'\'\'Revolting Cocks\'\'\', also known as \'\'\'RevCo\'\'\', was an [[United States|American]]\xe2\x80\x93[[Belgian]] [[industrial rock]] band and, sometimes, [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] that began as a musical side-project for [[Richard 23]] of [[Front 242]], [[Luc Van Acker]], and [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].

==History==
The group was founded by Richard 23 and Luc Van Acker with Al Jourgensen as their producer.<ref>{{cite web

</ref> According to Jourgensen, the band got their name after a fight in a Chicago bar in 1983. Jourgensen, Richard 23 and Luc Van Acker celebrated the formation of the new band with a few drinks. The evening then ended up in a brawl, with bar stools being thrown through the establishment\'s windows. As he was throwing the trio out, the owner, a man Jourgensen recalls<ref name="Al Jourgensen: Sex-O Olympic-O">{{cite web

 }}</ref> was named Dess, shouted, "I\'m calling the police! You guys are a bunch of revolting cocks!"<ref name="Al Jourgensen: Sex-O Olympic-O"/> The trio subsequently decided to use the name for their band. 

Their first release was "No Devotion" on [[Wax Trax]] records in 1985. The single was quickly followed by an album, \'\'[[Big Sexy Land]]\'\' (1986), featuring a mix of Wax Trax-industrial, hard rock, and [[Electronic body music|EBM]] with dominating sampling and strong synthesized beats. 

Losing Richard 23 due to creative differences, the group\'s remaining two members were augmented by a rapidly changing set of musicians centered on [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]] ([[Finitribe]], later solo work, [[Murder, Inc. (band)|Murder Inc.]], and [[The Damage Manual]]), [[Paul Barker]] ([[The Blackouts]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], later [[Pink Anvil]], [[U.S.S.A.]], and Flowering Blight), and [[Bill Rieflin]] (The Blackouts, Ministry, later playing with [[R.E.M.]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock]]), with around twenty others as irregular contributors or guest artists.

The following live album, \'\'[[You Goddamned Son of a Bitch - Live|You Goddamned Son of a Bitch]]\'\' (1988), featured a return to Ministry-like industrial rock - the \'\'Big Sexy Land\'\' tracks embedded in shouting and noise. This trend continued on \'\'[[Beers, Steers, and Queers]]\'\' (1990), layering sample over sample and pushing ever further into distortion. \'\'[[Linger Ficken\' Good]]\'\' (1993) was released by Sire records and is a tamer affair, most tracks returning to the less layered material. Included was a cover of [[Rod Stewart]]\'s "[[Da Ya Think I\'m Sexy?]]," also released as a single. A tour was planned but cancelled, and the band quietly came to an end.

In 2004, Jourgensen, with former Cock Phildo Owens ([[Skatenigs]], Snow Black), revived the group and released iterations of \'\'Prune Tang\'\' to disappointing responses from fans. An album titled \'\'Purple Head\'\' was due in 2004, but was delayed until 2006 with a change in title, \'\'[[Cocked and Loaded]]\'\'. "Caliente (Dark Entries)," a cover of sorts of "Dark Entries" by [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], with vocalist [[Gibby Haynes]] ([[Butthole Surfers]]), was featured on the [[Saw II (soundtrack)|soundtrack to \'\'Saw II\'\']] in 2005.

After assembling a touring line up to open for Ministry on the MasterBaTour of 2006, Jourgensen chose vocalist Josh Bradford (Stayte, Simple Shelter, V.H.S.), keyboardist [[Clayton Worbeck]] (Stayte, Simple Shelter), and guitarist [[Sin Quirin]] ([[Society 1]], later Ministry and ReVamp) as the new full-time members for the Revolting Cocks, now simply being called "RevCo". The group recorded \'\'[[Sex-O Olympic-O]]\'\', which was originally set to be released in October 2008, but was delayed until the following February, and was officially released on March 3, 2009. \'\'Sex-O Olympic-O\'\' was followed up by \'\'[[Got Cock?]]\'\', released on April 13, 2010.

In celebration of Wax Trax! Records, the "Wax Trax! Records Retrospectacle: 33 1/3 Year Anniversary" was held from April 15 to 17, 2011 at [[Metro Chicago]] in Chicago, Illinois. As a part of the lineup, Chris Connelly, Paul Barker and Luc Van Acker performed Revolting Cocks songs with various guests. For their performance on the 17th, Richard 23 joined them on stage to sing lead vocals on "No Devotion".<ref>prongs.org/ministry [http://www.prongs.org/ministry/ "Wax Trax! Records Retrospectacle"].

\'\'\'Sister Machine Gun\'\'\' was an [[industrial rock]] band based in Chicago.

==History==

===The early years===

Sister Machine Gun was formed by [[Chris Randall (musician)|Chris Randall]] and [[Guilherme Machado]] in [[New York City]]. They performed at [[New Jersey]]\'s Pipeline, and New York\'s Limelight.  The band went on a short hiatus after Chris Randall joined KMFDM\'s tour as a stage technician.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/sister-machine-gun/33904 | title=Sister Machine Gun Bio | author=Burn, John | work=All Music Guide | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref>  After the tour, Randall left New York City and relocated to [[Chicago]].  He then found work in the mailroom of [[Wax Trax! Records]],<ref name="billboard"/> and began recording a demo with [[Jim Marcus]] and [[Van Christie]] of [[Die Warzau]].  The rough demo was given to [[Sascha Konietzko]] of [[KMFDM]] for mixing.<ref name="billboard"/>  Konietzko passed the demo along to Jim Nash, head of Wax Trax! Records, where Randall worked. The label then signed the band to a record deal.

===The Wax Trax! Years===
Sister Machine Gun\'s debut album \'\'Sins of the Flesh\'\' was released on Wax Trax! in 1992.<ref name="official">{{cite web | url=http://www.sistermachinegun.com/bio.jsp | title=Sister Machine Gun Biography | publisher=Chris Randall | accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref>  During this time, Chris Randall assembled a group of musicians to tour in support of the album.  Tom Gaul and [[Steve Stoll (musician)|Steve Stoll]] joined the band, alongside Kelly and Randall.  Stoll left the band after this tour, and work on the next album began.

\'\'The Torture Technique\'\' was released in 1994.<ref name="official"/>  Tom Gaul left midway through the recording process, after contributing to the album.  New members were recruited for the upcoming tour.  Guitarist Greg Lucas (later a member of [[The Final Cut (band)|Final Cut]]) joined, as well as drummer Scott Churilla (later a member of [[The Reverend Horton Heat]]\'s band).  Sister Machine Gun went on to join the Angstfest tour with KMFDM and [[Chemlab]].

After this tour, Chris Kelly left the band.  Prior to the recording of \'\'Burn\'\', Sister Machine Gun went on another tour.  The lineup during this time consisted of Chris Randall, bassist Bob Jones, drummer Tom DeSalvo (former member of Chemlab), and Chris Smits on guitar.

The band then began work on the album \'\'Burn\'\'.  Guitarist Geno Lenardo (of [[Filter (band)|Filter]]) joined in the studio.  \'\'Burn\'\' was released in 1995.<ref name="official"/>  The title track became one of the band\'s most recognizable songs, as it later appeared on the \'\'[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]\'\' [[Mortal Kombat (soundtrack)|soundtrack]].

The tour line-up at this time consisted of Chris Randall, bassist Richard Deacon, and drummer Kevin Temple (formerly of [[Die Warzau]] and later [[Apartment 26]]).  This line up remained mostly consistent throughout the touring for Burn and Metropolis, with guitarists Pat Sprawl and Brian Sarche joining at various times.

The final Sister Machine Gun album on Wax Trax!, \'\'Metropolis\'\', was released in 1997.<ref name="official"/>  [[Reeves Gabrels]] did guitar work on the album.

===The Positron! Years===
After [[1997 in music|1997\'s]] \'\'Metropolis\'\' album, Sister Machine Gun left Wax Trax.  The rest of the band\'s material was released on Chris Randall\'s [[Positron! Records]],<ref name="official"/> the record label he founded and operates with his wife, Lisa. The band\'s sound changed considerably after their move to the new label.

In 2007, Sister Machine Gun officially disbanded and Chris Randall began a solo career.

===New Material (2015)===
On November 5, 2014, a Facebook Page for Sister Machine Gun was launched, along with a teaser image announcing the project\'s return in Spring of 2015 on [[WTII Records]].<ref name="Sister Machine Gun on Facebook">
{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/sistermachinegun | title=Facebook: Sister Machine Gun | accessdate=November 5, 2014}}</ref> This image was also shared on Chris Randall\'s personal Facebook account with the caption, \'\'"Remember that thing I said I\'d never do again? Yeah. I\'m doing it. Spring \'15 on WTII Records."\'\'

==Primary Member History==
Guilherme Machado joined Randall in Chicago for the recording of the band\'s debut album, \'\'Sins of the Flesh\'\'.  After recording some guitar parts, Machado left the band.  After the completion of the album, Chris Kelly joined the band.  After Kelly\'s departure in 1995, Randall continued the band primarily as a solo project.  Miguel Turanzas joined the band in 1999, and continued as a member until it was disbanded in 2007.

\'\'\'Snog\'\'\' is a band that was formed by [[Australia]]n musician [[David Thrussell]], along with fellow art school friends Tim McGrath and Julia Bourke in 1989.<ref name=songicboom96>{{cite web|last=Jester|title=Interview with David Thrussel of Black Lung, Snog & Soma - conducted by phone 11/7/96|url=http://www.sonic-boom.com/interview/imcc-1.interview.html|work=Sonic Boom Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=11/07/1996|year=1996}}</ref> The band\'s music is a fusion of many different styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]], [[techno music|techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[experimental music|experimental]], [[funk music|funk]] and [[country music]].<ref name=effigy>{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=SNOG|url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/9747/1snog.html|work=Effigy Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011004134315/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/9747/1snog.html|archivedate=04/10/2001}}</ref><ref name=kdvs>{{cite web|last=Ben (DJ VSX)|title=Snog...Black_Lung...Soma = David Thrussell|url=http://www.kdvs.org/cru/interviews/thrussell.html|work=KDVS Radio|publisher=The Associated Students of the University of California Davis|accessdate=30 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010725141116/http://www.kdvs.org/cru/interviews/thrussell.html|archivedate=2001-07-25}}</ref> The band name is a reference to "kissing and cuddling,"<ref name="songicboom96" /> and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the [[Marxist]] concept of destroying barriers between people.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Thrussell also records as \'\'\'Black Lung\'\'\', which started as a brand to release extra Snog recordings.

==History==
Snog\'s first album \'\'Lies Inc.\'\' was released in 1992 and [[Pieter Bourke]], who has since worked with [[Dead Can Dance]] and [[Lisa Gerrard]], joined the band soon afterwards. The second album \'\'Dear Valued Customer\'\', which drew heavily on techno influences, was then released in 1994. Also in 1994, the side projects Soma (Thrussell and Pieter Bourke)<ref name=disinfo>{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Alex|title=david thrussell|url=http://old.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id173/pg1/|work=Disinfo|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=01/07/2001|year=2001}}</ref> and Black Lung.<ref name=songicboom96>{{cite web}}</ref>

By 1997, the band was primarily a solo project for Thrussell, who collaborated with guest musicians on recordings. The next album release was \'\'Buy Me... I\'ll Change Your Life\'\' and country western-style guitar was featured, as well as a [[cover version]] of [[Lee Hazlewood]]\'s "Let the Little Flowers Grow". \'\'Third Mall from the Sun\'\' followed in 1999 and the album blended the styles of the previous two albums, in addition to new influences. Thrussell described the progression of Snog\'s musical styles in a 1998 interview with \'\'Sonic Boom Magazine\'\': "In the past Snog has written a lot of dance floor material and while it has been successful, I kind of felt that I needed to write something different. I intentionally try and do something new with every Snog release. I do not want to get caught up in the musical trap of remaking the same album over and over".<ref name=sonicboom98>{{cite web|last=Jester|title=Interview with David Thrussel of Black Lung, Snog & Soma - conducted by phone 6/5/98|url=http://www.sonic-boom.com/interview/imcc-2.interview.html|work=Sonic Boom Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=06/05/1998|year=1998}}</ref>

\'\'Third Mall from the Sun\'\' was followed by the remix album \'\'Relax into the Abyss\'\'. In 2003, the album \'\'Beyond the Valley of the Proles\'\' was released and its follow-up \'\'Snog vs. the Faecal Juggernaut of Mass Culture\'\' was released three years later.

Snog continued to release music into the 21st century and the [[Extended play|EP]] \'\'Everything Is Under Control\'\' (consists of [[remix]]es and the additional song "The Lament of the Lost Sheep") was released on [[iTunes]] on 25 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything Is Under Control (Remixes) - EP Snog|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/everything-is-under-control/id609044840|work=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple, Inc|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=25 March 2013}}</ref> The EP was followed by the 23 April 2013 album release \'\'Babes In Consumerland\'\' and both recordings are part of a contract with the Metropolis record label.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything Is Under Control (digital only)|url=http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/digital.php?prodnum=MET+852D|work=Metropolis Mail Order|publisher=Metropolis Records|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=2001\xe2\x80\x932013}}</ref>

A [[music video]] for "Adolph\'s Library", from \'\'Babes in Consumerland\'\', was published on the Internet in June 2013. The video was directed by [[Richard Wolstencroft]], filmmaker and founder/director of the [[Melbourne Underground Film Festival]] (MUFF) and was filmed on location at the State Library Of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snog - Adolph\'s Library|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGfSgC7X_V8&feature=youtu.be|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=11 August 2013|author=rgrant|format=Video upload|date=10 June 2013}}</ref>

==Black Lung==

In 1994 Thrussell released \'\'Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\'\', an album of B-sides from Snog\'s lengthy Australian CD singles for the German market - the Australian singles were up to 80 minutes, whereas chart-eligible singles in Germany could not be more than 21 minutes, so many tracks were left over. The album was mostly composed of instrumental tracks taken from Snog\'s first album \'\'Lies Inc.\'\' and the \'\'Hey, Christian God\'\' single. (A year later, the album was also released on [[Germany]]\'s [[Machinery Records]] as \'\'Silent Weapons for Silent Wars\'\'. Thrussell disowned this later release due to the incorrect title, changes made to the artwork, and the fact that the tracks were in the wrong order, destroying the album\'s continuity.)

Since 1999, nearly all Black Lung releases have been on German industrial label [[Ant-Zen]]. In 1999, Thrussell collaborated with [[John Sellekaers]] from [[Xingu Hill]] to produce the 10" EP \'\'The Andronechron Incident\'\', purportedly a soundtrack for an obscure [[Italy|Italian]] [[science fiction]] film. A full-length CD of the same title, containing many more additional tracks, was released in 2002 .

Thematically, Thrussell has used the project as an opportunity to indulge his fascination with [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], with many album and track titles referencing conspiracies. \'\'Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars\'\', also used by, [[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars|Killarmy]]), refers to a document which came to light in the mid 1980s detailing a [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] plan. \'\'Rhic-Edom\'\' is a direct reference to the acronym RHIC-EDOM: Radio-Hypnotic Intracerebral Control & [[Electronic dissolution|Electronic Dissolution of Memory]]. The albums\' [[liner notes]] frequently contain essays on various esoteric subjects, excerpted from conspiracy books or written by Thrussell himself.

2014 saw the return of the project with a Vinyl,"The Business Of Selling" release on M-Tronic records as a limited edition of 300 copies. 

==Politics==
Thrussell\'s songs frequently contain themes of anti-[[consumerism]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Cameron|first=Dan|title=David Thrussell interview by Dan Cameron|url=http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/blog/2007/07/29/david-thrussell-interview-by-dan-cameron/|work=Cyclic Defrost Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=2007-07-29}}</ref> [[individuality]] and [[Big Brother (1984)|anti-big-brotherism]].

In a 2008 review of \'\'The Last Days of Rome\'\', Matthew Rich from \'\'Left Hip Magazine\'\' described Snog as "the greatest band at the moment".<ref name=lefthip>{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Matthew|title=Snog - The Last Days of Rome|url=http://www.lefthip.com/albums/2427|work=Left Hip Magazine|accessdate=30 May 2011|date=March 2008}}</ref>

\'\'\'Stabbing Westward\'\'\' was an American [[industrial rock]] band.  They formed in 1985 in [[Macomb, Illinois]] and began recording in the 1990s. The band announced a dissolution in 2002.

Regarding the band\'s name, Andy Kubiszewski said: "essentially when Chris and Walter were putting the band together, they had a gig and there was a deadline for a name for the band, so they pulled out a bunch of album covers and they pulled out a record cover and it had an excerpt from, I believe it was an Eisenhower speech, where he was talking about communism coming to the west and he used the phrase "stabbing westward," and they went oh well, "Stabbing Westward", that will work."<ref name="entertainmentavenue1">{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentavenue.com/concert_hall/q_and_a/stabbing_westward/sw112196.htm |title=Entertainment Ave! The Concert Hall - A Question & Answer Interview with Andy Kubiszewski of Stabbing Westward, November 21, 1996 |publisher=Entertainmentavenue.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>

In truth, the phrase was used in a 1947 newsreel and spoken by an unknown announcer.  The newsreel is included as part of the 1982 documentary film [[The Atomic Cafe]].

==History==
=== Early years (1985\xe2\x80\x931992) ===
Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus formed the band Stabbing Westward when they were in college. They came up with the name  while working at the college radio station [[WIUS|WIUS-FM]]. In a 1996 interview, Hall stated, "Since we went to [[Western Illinois University]], Stabbing Westward had a certain \'kill everybody in the school\' vibe to it! The school\'s way out in farm country and the country is really close minded. I was walking around like [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] with real big hair, big baggy black clothes, black fingernail polish and eye makeup. They just didn\'t get it. We hated the town."<ref>Interview by George Lecorchick, R & R Reported, April 1996</ref>

Moving to Chicago in 1986, the original lineup consisted of Hall on bass and lead vocals, Flakus on keyboards, and Jim Clanin on guitar (Clanin later purchased, and as of 2013, operates the [[Dairy Queen]] in [[Macomb, Illinois]]). In 1990, a four song demo tape was recorded by an early conception of Stabbing Westward. This "EP" called, "Iwo Jimma" featured an early version of "Violent Mood Swings" (titled, "Violent Mood Swing") which eventually wound up on the compilation CD, \'\'The Cyberflesh Conspiracy\'\'.  Each of the three remaining demo songs were later reworked over the years ("Shame [Do You Think God Is Dead]" became "Shame", "P.O.M.F." became "The Thing I Hate", and "Plastic Jesus" became "Dawn"). Original version of Shame was written before Stabbing Westward got signed to [[Columbia Records]]. It had different lyrics and it was about God, religion, and war.

Hall took a brief break to tour with [[Die Warzau]] as that group\'s percussionist before continuing work on Stabbing Westward.  Hall and Flakus later recruited Jim Sellers on bass and [[Chris Vrenna]] ([[Nine Inch Nails]]) on drums, as Hall had met Vrenna when playing in Die Warzau.  Vrenna played drums on all the demo recordings that ultimately landed Stabbing Westward their record deal with Columbia Records. Those demo recordings included Violent Mood Swings, Lies, and Nothing. They were recorded at a studio in [[Evanston, Illinois]] and included Stuart Zechman on guitar. After Vrenna returned to Nine Inch Nails, the band hired Dave Suycott who was a high school friend of Flakus.

===\'\'Ungod\'\' (1993\xe2\x80\x931995)===
The trio added [[Wax Trax]] recording artist Stuart Zechman on guitar and David Suycott ([[Spies Who Surf]] [[Machines of Loving Grace]]) on drums. In 1993, the band recorded in [[Eden Studios]]; [[London, England]] with producer John Fryer. This resulted in their major label ([[Columbia Records]]) debut, \'\'[[Ungod]]\'\', which hit stores in 1994.  The band landed an opening slot on the [[Depeche Mode]] [[Exotic Tour]] in Summer 1994 and opened North American tour dates in Fall 1994 for [[Killing Joke]], but Stabbing Westward album sales were still sluggish.

David Suycott abruptly dropped out of the band toward the end of the Ungod tour.  Andy Kubiszewski was called in to replace Suycott\'s position for the remainder of the shows.  This fast replacement required Kubiszewski to learn all of Suycott\'s parts while on his flight to meet with the band.  Kubiszewski became a permanent fixture of Stabbing Westward.

Also, their song "Nothing" was featured in the "Club Hell" scene of the motion picture, [[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]], as well as during the closing credits of [[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]. The songs "Lies", "Lost" and "Can\'t Happen Here" were also all featured in the first [[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]] movie. However, these songs weren\'t featured on the CD soundtrack.

===\'\'Wither, Blister, Burn & Peel\'\' (1995\xe2\x80\x931997)===
When Stuart Zechman departed the band after the Ungod tour due to personal differences,<ref name="entertainmentavenue1"/> the remaining band members found themselves without one of their major songwriters. New drummer Andy Kubiszewski took over some songwriting duties afterward. Prior to playing in Stabbing Westward, Andy had not only played drums in [[The The]], recorded one song for [[Nine Inch Nails]], and played in [[Prick (band)|Prick]], but had been the singer and songwriter in the Cleveland based [[Exotic Birds]]. Shortly after Zechmans departure Andy played the band dozens of demos and Exotic Birds recordings. Included were "What Do I Have To Do", "Haunting Me", "Sometimes It Hurts", "Crushing Me", "Slipping Away", "Desperate Now", and "Goodbye". These tracks would later find space on both the \'\'Wither\'\' and \'\'Darkest Days\'\' albums. When the band headed to Bearsville Studios in [[Woodstock, New York]] without a permanent guitar player, they decided to play all the guitar parts themselves, with Sellers and Kubiszewski taking on most of the guitar duties. The band later recruited Mark Eliopulos after the \'\'Wither, Blister, Burn & Peel\'\' recording sessions were completed to handle the live-element of the main guitar parts.

"Sometimes It Hurts" music video was supposed to be [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]] themed video, but the label feared they would be sued so they took out most references.

In 1996, the \'\'[[Wither Blister Burn & Peel]]\'\' LP became a success, landing them their first [[certified gold]] album, aided by the singles "Shame" and "What Do I Have to Do?" which granted the band heavy rotation on [[MTV]], [[MuchMusic]] and radio. Tour mates for this album included [[Sponge (band)|Sponge]].

===\'\'Darkest Days\'\' (1998\xe2\x80\x932000)===
Stabbing Westward relocated to [[Los Angeles, California]] where they began work on the 1998 album, titled \'\'[[Darkest Days]]\'\'.  Darkest Days was envisioned as a four-act story by the band (but never marketed as such). This is the only release featuring studio work by Mark Eliopulos. The first single, "Save Yourself," had success yet the album failed to sell as well as its predecessor.  Stabbing Westward continued to tour with bands like [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[The Cult]], [[Monster Magnet]], and [[Depeche Mode]], while playing numerous summer festivals.

The day before the band was to fly to [[Hawaii]] to record the follow-up to Darkest Days with producer [[Bob Rock]], the band was dropped by Columbia Records.

The song "The Thing I Hate" was featured as the opening theme song to the game \'\'[[Duke Nukem: Time to Kill]]\'\', which was also released in 1998.  The song "Torn apart" was featured as a remix with Wink, on the Spawn movie soundtrack in July 1997. The song "What Do I Have to Do" was featured in 1997\'s \'\'[[Masterminds (1997 film)|Masterminds]]\'\'. The song "Save Yourself" was featured in the 1998 films \'\'[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]\'\' and \'\'[[Tekken: The Motion Picture|Tekken]]\'\' in addition to the \'\'[[True Blood]]\'\' [[Save Yourself (True Blood)|season five finale of the same name]]. The song "Haunting Me" was featured in the opening scenes of the teen horror flick \'\'[[The Faculty (film)|The Faculty]]\'\'.

===Self-titled  (2001\xe2\x80\x932002)===
When signed to [[Koch Records]], the band got new manager that wanted to turn the band into pop band. Christopher Hall, Walter Flakus and Mark Eliopulos were fighting against that decision. The manager fired Mark Eliopulos by pulling strings within the band and brought Derrek Hawkins as both a studio musician and live musician for the band, and a new producer, [[Ed Buller]]<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvzqzrpV4_o |title=Christopher Hall Interviewed about Stabbing Westward & The Dreaming |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>

The demo of self-titled album was darker. Old guitar parts from demos were muted and the new guitarist wrote new guitar parts that were more pop influenced.<ref name="youtube1"/>

The self-titled album, \'\'[[Stabbing Westward (album)|Stabbing Westward]]\'\', was released in 2001 and featured the hit "So Far Away". The album did well in Australia, but ultimately failed to sell worldwide.<ref name="youtube1"/>

Their manager hired out 2 members from Stabbing Westward to another band. After that band the did not renew their record deal. Before a fifth LP could be recorded, Stabbing Westward formally announced on February 9, 2002 that they had broken up.

===Post-break-up===
* Lead singer Christopher Hall has formed the [[Los Angeles]]-based band [[The Dreaming (US band)|The Dreaming]]. They released their first studio album \'\'[[Etched In Blood]]\'\' in 2008.

The band spent 3 years touring as a headliner and co-headliners with bands such as [[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]] and [[Flaw (band)|Flaw]].

===Rumors of a reunion (2010)===
In June 2010, a news item appeared on Tunelab.com which read as follows:

\'\'Stabbing Westward vocalist Christopher Hall and keyboardist Walter Flakus have reunited after eight years apart and are planning a late-summer or fall tour this year under their old moniker.  Potential support acts are [[Gravity Kills]] and Hall\xe2\x80\x99s current project The Dreaming.  There are currently no plans to record a new album, but the possibility has not been ruled out for a 2011 release depending on how the two feel after touring this year.\'\'<ref>Tunelab.com, June 8, 2010, Stabbing Westward Reunited;Planning Tour This Year</ref>

The next day, another piece of news appeared on the same website:

\'\'As a followup to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news post on Stabbing Westward reuniting and touring, TuneLab did speak to former keyboardist Walter Flakus, who stated had no knowledge of any reunion but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly adverse to the idea.  We were originally told the information by the booking agency for former vocalist Christopher Hall\xe2\x80\x99s current project The Dreaming.  After seeking clarification from the agency, we have learned that Stabbing Westward will actually be made up of current members of The Dreaming, and vocalist Christopher Hall at some point was going to be approaching keyboardist Walter Flakus to reunite for the tour. The exact lineup of the band is up in the air, but their agency is in fact booking a tour for late-summer or fall for Stabbing Westward, The Dreaming, and potentially Gravity Kills.\'\'<ref>Tunelab.com, June 9, 2010, Stabbing Westward "Reunion" Update</ref>

Since this post, there have been no more announcements regarding a Stabbing Westward tour and it is unclear whether these two news items were merely just rumors or actual plans.

In a radio interview on December 7, 2011, Christopher Hall along with the rest of The Dreaming, were guests on WJJO (Madison, WI) morning show. Hall stated there were absolutely no plans for a Stabbing Westward reunion, because of continued animosity between original and more recent members. Hall also hinted that neither he nor Flakus, the founding members, have rights to the name Stabbing Westward anymore. Other more recent members of the band somehow through contracts and agents, had acquired the naming rights along with some of the song rights.

On July 23, 2012, a fan created a petition for a reunion tour.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Mike |url=http://www.idioteq.com/stabbing-westward-reunion-in-the-works/ |title=STABBING WESTWARD reunion in the works? |publisher=Idioteq.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>

Christopher Hall, Walter Flakus, and Johnny Haro reunited at one of The Dreaming\'s shows in Las Vegas on November 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musictourreviews.com/2013/11/18/the-dreaming-4#sthash.L4XkAfFL.jlWzi2Nd.dpbs |title=\xc2\xbb The Dreaming &#124; Stabbing Westward Reunion |publisher=Musictourreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref>  Flakus would later join The Dreaming on a permanent basis.
The band The Dreaming announced a North American tour in early 2015, featuring original Stabbing Westward founders Christopher Hall and Walter Flakus.

\'\'\'Suicide\'\'\' is an American [[electronic music|electronic]] [[synthpunk]] musical duo, intermittently active since 1970 and composed of [[Singing|vocalist]] [[Alan Vega]] and [[Martin Rev]] on [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. It is an early synthesizer/vocal musical duo.

Never widely popular among the general public, Suicide are highly influential: critic Wilson Neate argues that Suicide "would prove as influential as [[the Clash]]. The [[synthpop]], [[techno]], and [[industrial dance]] sounds of the 1980s and 1990s, and now the new New Wave of [[electroclash]], all gesture back to that foundational album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/483 |title=Dusted Reviews: Suicide - American Supreme |publisher=Dustedmagazine.com |date=2002-11-24 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

In a November 1970 [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] the band was the first ever to use the phrase "[[punk music]]" to advertise a concert.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-01-29/news/suicide-watch/1 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |date=January 29, 2002| title=The second gig took place at the Soho gallery OK Harris, where Vega also held his first show. "On the gig flyers, we announced it as a Punk Music Mass. We didn\'t invent the word\xe2\x80\x94I probably got it from an article on the Stooges by Lester Bangs\xe2\x80\x94but I think we were the first band to describe our music as punk."  |publisher=[[Village Voice]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromthearchives.org/av_mr/chronology.html |title=Suicide - Chronology |accessdate=2010-04-30 |publisher=From The Archives}}</ref>

==History==
Suicide took their name from the title of a [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] [[comic book]] titled \'\'Satan Suicide\'\', a favorite of Alan Vega.<ref name="Reynolds143">Reynolds, 2006. p. 143</ref> Rev\'s simple keyboard [[riff]]s, (initially played on a battered [[Farfisa|Farfisa organ]] combined with [[effects units]], before changing to a [[synthesizer]]), were accompanied by primitive [[drum machine]]s, providing a pulsing, minimalistic, electronic backdrop for Vega\'s [[murmuring]] and nervy vocals. They were the first band to use the term punk to describe themselves, which they had adopted from an article by [[Lester Bangs]]. Some of their earliest posters use the terms "punk music" and "punk music mass".

Suicide emerged alongside the early [[glam punk]] scene in New York, with a reputation for their confrontational [[concert|live shows]]. Many of their early shows were at the [[Mercer Arts Center]], alongside bands like the [[New York Dolls]] and [[Eric Emerson|Eric Emerson and the Magic Tramps]]. [[David Johansen]] once played harmonica with Suicide in an early show there. Vega and Rev both dressed like arty street thugs, and Vega was notorious for brandishing a length of motorcycle [[drive chain]] onstage. Vega once stated "We started getting booed as soon as we came onstage. Just from the way we looked they started giving us hell already." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/january2003/interviews/alanVegaPartI.html |title=Alan Vega |accessdate=2010-01-01 |last=Moyer |first=Matthew|date=January 2003 |publisher=[[Ink 19]]}}</ref> This sort of audience confrontation was inspired by Vega\'s witnessing of an [[The Stooges|Iggy and the Stooges]] concert at the [[New York State Pavilion]] in August 1969, which he later described as "great art". After the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center in 1973, Suicide played at [[Max\'s Kansas City]] and [[CBGB]], often sharing the bill with emerging [[Punk rock|punk]] bands. Their first album was reissued with bonus material, including "[[23 Minutes Over Brussels]]", a recording of a Suicide concert that deteriorated into a [[riot]].

Their first album, \'\'[[Suicide (1977 album)|Suicide]]\'\' (1977), is regarded a classic. One critic writes: "\'Che", "Ghost Rider"\xe2\x80\x94these eerie, sturdy, proto-punk anthems rank among the most visionary, melodic experiments the rock realm has yet produced." Of note is the ten-minute "[[Frankie Teardrop]]", which tells the story of a poverty-stricken young factory worker, pushed to the edge. Critic [[Emerson Dameron]] writes that the song is "one of the most terrifying, riveting, absurd things I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dustedmagazine.com/features/543 |title=Ghost Songs - Our Favorite Halloween Tunes |accessdate=2010-01-01 |last=Dameron |first=Emerson |work=Dusted Magazine}}</ref> [[Nick Hornby]] in his book \'\'[[31 Songs]]\'\' described "Frankie Teardrop" as something you would listen to "Only once".<ref name="Hornby">{{cite book|title=31 Songs|author=Nick Hornby|publisher=McSweeney\'s}}</ref>

Suicide\'s albums of the late 1970s and early 1980s are regarded as some of the most influential recordings of their time and helped shape the direction of [[indie rock]], [[industrial music]] and [[dance music]]. Among others, [[Steve Albini]] (Shellac, Rapeman, Big Black), [[Panth\xc3\xa9re]], [[Gang Gang Dance]], [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[She Wants Revenge]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Joy Division]]/[[New Order]], [[Soft Cell]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]], [[Erasure (band)|Erasure]], [[The KLF]],<ref name="David Nobahkt 2004 188">{{cite book|title=Suicide: No Compromise|year=2004|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719716|page=188|author=David Nobahkt}}</ref> [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Suicide: No Compromise|year=2004|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719716|page=166|author=David Nobahkt|quote=By the end of the eighties, Suicide\'s influence could be heard in the output of the industrial dance/ rock/noise bands that emerged during that era.

Suicide\'s influence on their sound is indisputable. Martin L Gore of Depeche Mode told The Times newspaper, "The synthesizer before Suicide was always a clean-cut instrument, whereas they brought in a punk element." He went on to say, "That was a very important step in the history of electronic music, they were way before The Prodigy and the whole industrial scene." Alan Wilder, Depeche Mode\'s music director and keyboard player from \'82 to \'95, had taken notice of Suicide\'s sampled and manipulated guitar sounds whilst recording the 1990 album Violator. Wilder later commented on his Shunt Website. "When we recorded the track "Blue Dress" it was based around using washy sounding, drone guitars (a la Suicide) which formed the backbone of the track."}}</ref> [[Jello Biafra]] of the [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Devo]], [[Ultravox]], [[Massive Attack]],<ref>{{cite web|title=A Big, Booming Show With Space for Reflection: \xe2\x80\x98Massive Attack V Adam Curtis,\xe2\x80\x99 a Film and a Concert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/arts/music/massive-attack-v-adam-curtis-a-film-and-a-concert.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=25 April 2014|author=Ben Ratliff|date=September 29, 2013|quote=During all of this, Massive Attack \xe2\x80\x94 along with the guest singers Horace Andy and Liz Fraser \xe2\x80\x94 acts as a kind of house-band mood setter.

Furthermore, Springsteen also used a solo keyboard version of "Dream Baby Dream" to close the concerts on his 2005 [[Devils & Dust Tour]], and released a studio version of his cover on his 2014 album \'\'[[High Hopes (album)|High Hopes]]\'\'.

In 1986, Alan Vega collaborated with [[Andrew Eldritch]] of The Sisters of Mercy on the \'Gift\' album, released under the name of \'The Sisterhood\'. Vega and Rev have both released solo albums, and Suicide released their first album in over a decade with 2002\'s \'\'[[American Supreme]]\'\'. Sales, however, were slow and critical reception was mixed.

In 2005, SAF Publishing put out \'\'[[Suicide No Compromise]]\'\', a "docu-biography" by [[David Nobahkt]], which featured extensive interviews with Vega and Rev as well as many of their contemporaries and famous fans.

In 2008, [[Blast First Petite]] released a monthly, limited edition series of 10" Vinyl EP\'s and downloads by major artists, honoring Alan Vega\'s 70th birthday. Among those paying tribute were Bruce Springsteen, Primal Scream, Peaches, Grinderman, [[Spiritualized]], The Horrors, +Pansonic, Julian Cope, Lydia Lunch, Vincent Gallo, LIARS, & The Klaxons. The label also released "Suicide: 1977\xe2\x80\x931978", a 6 CD box-set, the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2008/06/24/alan-vega-turns-70-years-old-suicide-box-set-and-single-series-set-for-release-major-artists-pay-tribute-to-suicidevega-in-year-long-monthly-series-of-limited-edition-of-10-vinyl-eps-and-dow/|title=Alan Vega Turns 70- Years Old/Box Set |author=Paul Smith |year=2008 |publisher=MV Remix Rock |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

In mid-2009, the band [[The Horrors]] released a cover of the song "Shadazz" as part of a tribute to Alan Vega and his work. They\'ve performed it many times live, along with another Suicide song, "Ghost Rider". Later that year, [[Primal Scream]] and [[Miss Kittin]] covered the song "[[Suicide: Alan Vega and Martin Rev|Diamonds, Fur Coat, Champagne]]" for a limited-edition 10-inch vinyl pressing. A total of 3,000 copies were pressed and released on March 30, 2009.<ref name="nmeprimalscream">{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/primal-scream/42699| title=Primal Scream cover Suicide for new single |work=[[NME]] |date=2009-02-11| accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

In April 2011, the influential [[dance-punk]] band [[LCD Soundsystem]] used a snippet from "Ghost Rider" during the song "[[Losing My Edge]]" and covered the Alan Vega solo effort "[[Bye Bye Bayou]]" during their final concert, held in a sold-out [[Madison Square Garden]].

In April 2012, [[Neneh Cherry]] released a cover of the song "Dream Baby Dream" which appeared on her album, \'\'The Cherry Thing\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13425-dream-baby-dream/ |title=Various Artists: "Dream Baby Dream" |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2012-04-11 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>

The \'\'\'Swamp Terrorists\'\'\' are a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[electronic music|electro]]-[[industrial music]] group that was started in the late 1980s by synthesizer programmer STR, (of Band Berne Crematoire, Nacht-Raum, and Strangler of the Swamp fame) and vocalist Ane Hebeisen (aka Ane H), (formerly of Tierstein), who met at a Strangler/Tierstein show. 

Their music is harsh pounding electro mixed with grinding metal guitar riffs (which are usually [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from other [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands), and produces a sound similar to [[Die Warzau]], [[KMFDM]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]].

The original line-up consisted of STR, Ane H, and guitarist Francis H, who left after the release of their first EP, \'\'He is Guilty\'\'. Ane and STR recorded their first album, \'\'Grim-Stroke-Disease\'\' together, releasing it on the Machinery/Noise [[Record label|label]] in [[1990 in music|1990]]. About a year later, it was followed by \'\'Grow-Speed Injection\'\'. 

Shortly after the [[1994 in music|1994]] album \'\'Combat Shock\'\', Swamp Terrorists added several members for their live show: bassist Anrej A, guitarist Spring and drummer Piet Hertig. However, STR left the band immediately following the [[1995 in music|1995]] release \'\'Killer\'\', and began to work with the guitar-heavy Hellsau. The other four members of the band, as well as STR\'s live replacement ND, have since released a live album, \'\'Five in Japan\'\' and 2 EPs: \'\'Wreck\'\' in [[1997 in music|1997]], and \'\'Rare & Unreleased\'\' in [[1999 in music|1999]], on [[Metropolis Records]].

b'#REDIRECT [[Swans_(band)]]'

 ****** Test Dept

b'{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
\'\'\'Test Dept.\'\'\' were an [[industrial music]] group from [[London]], one of the most important and influential early industrial music acts. Their approach was marked by the use of "found" material, re-constructed to better serve their purpose, of making "more" with "less".
==History==
The group formed in the London suburb of [[New Cross]] in 1981. The core members of the group were Graham Cunnington, Paul Jamrozy, Jonathan Toby Burdon, Paul Hines and Angus Farquhar. Other members who played with the group at various times included Alistair Adams, Neil Starr, John Eacott, Andy Cowton, Tony Cudlip, David Coulter, Gus Ferguson and Martin King. Band signs to Some Bizzare Label the label connected acts like Depeche Mode Soft Cell, PTV, Foetus,  Swans. The slides and film for Test Dept multi-media events were made by visual director Brett Turnbull.

Their discography spans a wide variety of influences and styles, including a collaboration with the South Wales Striking Miners Choir in support of the [[UK miners\' strike (1984-1985)|miners\' strike of 1984]]. They were particularly notable for complex and powerful percussion, as well as high-energy live performances. Like the German band [[Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten]],another Some Bizzare Label signing with whom they are often compared, Test Dept used unconventional instruments such as scrap metal and industrial machinery as sound sources; however, Test Dept\'s use of these objects was far more rhythmic than was Neubauten\'s, and was often accompanied by film and slide shows. The group were noted for large-scale events in unusual site-specific locations, such as [[Waterloo station]], [[Cannon Street station]], [[Stirling Castle]] and the disused [[St. Rollox railway works|St Rollox Railway Works]] in [[Glasgow]].

The band\'s album \'\'The Unacceptable Face of Freedom\'\' was praised by a music reviewer for \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\', claiming the album was notable for a "\'\'sophisticated use of sound-collage techniques and the helter-skelter momentum of its cyclical rhythms\'\'".<ref>"The Pop Life: British Rock Bands add a message to the music" by Robert Palmer. \'\'The New York Times\'\', June 18th, 1986, Section C, pg. 18.</ref>

In later years the band\'s music became less industrial and took on many of the properties of [[techno]]. The band\'s political stance was energised by the passing of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

The band split up in 1997, but its former members have continued to work in the fields of art and culture. Angus Farquhar re-established the ancient [[Gaelic culture|Gaelic]] [[Beltane Fire Festival]], held yearly on the night before/morning of the first of May on [[Edinburgh]]\'s [[Calton Hill]]. Farquhar also formed [[NVA (arts organisation)|NVA]], an innovative theatre company specialising in large-scale site-specific events. Cunnington, who suffers from chronic [[rheumatoid arthritis]], produced a one-man show in 1996 called \'\'Pain\'\', recounting his experiences as a sufferer from this condition. Jamrozy works as an artist under the name of Satellitic. Gus Ferguson teaches music to orphans in Kathmandu, and young buddhist monks in Northern India.

\'\'\'Tweaker\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] collaboration founded by [[Chris Vrenna]] in the late 1990s. Tweaker\'s musical style incorporates [[synthpop]], [[progressive rock]], modern [[jazz]] and [[electronica]] genres, and is characterized by a generally melancholy and sombre sound with distinctive artwork to match.

The album \'\'[[The Attraction to All Things Uncertain]]\'\' was Vrenna\'s "solo" debut and it was not until the follow-up album, \'\'[[2 a.m. Wakeup Call]]\'\', that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band. While Vrenna and Walsh supply most instruments and electronics, many other famous musicians have lent their voices and talents to Tweaker, including [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]], [[David Sylvian]], [[Burton C. Bell]], [[Craig Wedren]], [[Will Oldham]], [[Hamilton Leithauser]], [[Buzz Osborne]], Jonathan Bates and [[Johnny Marr]].

The albums that have been released follow a central theme that was planned out and this was given to the collaborators. Both albums\' cover art were paintings by [[Joe Sorren]].

Tweaker wrote and performed the Soundtrack to \'\'[[Doom 3]]\'\', Of which the theme song was released via the band\'s website. The rest of the soundtrack is accessible from the game\'s files.

As Chris Vrenna and Clint Walsh, Tweaker did music for the animated television show [[Xiaolin Showdown]].

While the \'\'Doom 3\'\' theme was [[Heavy metal music|Heavy Metal]]-oriented (to the point of often being misattributed to [[Tool (band)|Tool]]), most of Tweaker\'s music presents a unique combination of [[synthpop]], [[shoegaze]], modern [[jazz]], [[Dark Ambient]] and [[industrial music|industrial]].

It was rumored for a while that Tweaker would release a new album in 2008, although no new material surfaced, possibly due to Vrenna\'s duties towards [[Marilyn Manson]], as he worked with Manson on his 2009 album \'\'[[The High End of Low]]\'\'.

==Live performance==
In 2004, Tweaker opened for [[Skinny Puppy]] on select dates with a full live band, consisting of Chris Vrenna (drums, percussion and keyboard), Clint Walsh (guitar and keyboard), Paul Ill (bass guitar and keyboards) and [[Nick Young (musician)|Nick Young]] (vocals). They performed everything completely live (i.e., no pre-recorded tape), although they did have to alter some of their songs to fit the live format \xe2\x80\x94 the most extreme case being a completely revamped rock version of "Microsize Boy".  The final performance on the tour was at QuakeCon 2005 in Dallas, TX.

\'\'\'Undercover Slut\'\'\' (also known as \'\'\'UCS\'\'\' and stylised as \'\'\'VNDERCOVER SLVT\'\'\') is a French/American [[shock rock]] and [[glam punk]] group, based in Paris, France.

Throughout the history of the band there have been multiple line-up changes, nearly thirty people have been involved with the band, while certain musicians do contribute music, [[vocalist]] and [[lyricist]] \'\'\'\'O\'\'\'\' remains the only constant member.

Although the group are most often referred to as a form of [[industrial music]] and indeed used that as part of their sound, they also implement strong elements of \'77 [[punk rock]] influence and [[gothic rock]], topped off with an image similar to [[glam rock]].

Undercover Slut have been a feature in [[underground music]], particularly in Europe since the 1990s, though they have also toured the [[United States]] several times. In terms of musical releases, the band has put out many self-produced recordings, their first official full-length album was \'\'Communism Is Fascism\'\' released in 2004, and which has gained them attention.

==Sound and image==
The group play have been covered by [[glam rock|glam]] media sources, and even had songs released on a couple glam compilations for USA\'s Delinquent Records. This is most likely because of their image, which incorporates heavy use of make-up. 

Undercover Slut\'s make-up bares a resemblance to that of the geisha, with striking white foundation topped off with bright red lipstick and black eye make-up. Due to darker elements of Glam in their image, the band are sometimes compared to [[Marilyn Manson]] by media who are not familiar with the band. However, Undercover Slut have stated strong opposition to that group, dismissing [[Brian Warner]] as a "clown" and quipping "That \'god of fat\' needs to call it quits".<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/indusmetal2005/int_undercoverslut.html Industrial Interview]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}}</ref>

Frontman \'O\' (A.K.A. \'\'\'Letter Number Thief-Teen\'\'\' and \'\'\'Romeo Gestapo\'\'\'), has cited punk rock bands [[Sex Pistols]] and the [[New York Dolls]] as an influence on Undercover Slut; this is mirrored in their music, which follows anti-establishment themes. The band themselves describe their music as "that perfect sexual intercourse between creepy [[deathrock]], \'77 [[punk rock]] nostalgia, [[Industrial music|industrial]] darkness and a so fuckin\' pretty larger-than-life [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]] Image."<ref>[http://www.undercoverslut.com/GlitzineIntw.htm Glitzine Interview]</ref>

==Animal rights and philanthropy ==
\'O\' is passionate about campaigning for [[animal rights]], and is said to be devout [[vegetarian]], Undercover Slut even has a section dedicated to them on the [[Animal Liberation Front]] website, as well as an interview discussing their beliefs.<ref>[http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Saints/Musicians/undercover_slut.htm Animal Liberation Front - "Saints"]</ref> On their album \'\'Communism Is Fascism\'\', Undercover Slut have a track regarding this, a blank 1 minute track titled "Sixty Silent Seconds to Repent for Your Animal Genocide". It is not only animal rights the band covers, they have also played an anti-[[paedophilia]] concert in Paris, France in July 2005.<ref>[http://www.undercoverslut.com/main.htm News - Anti-Padeo Show]</ref>

==Biography==
The band has existed in various forms since October 1995. Going through several line-up changes with leader \'O\' remaining as the only constant member. The musicians of Undercover Slut are only referred to and known by their stage names.

During the 1990s, Undercover Slut self-released various E.P.\'s through their own Hateful Society Production label. Their first demo album \'\'Lipstikk Whore No. 666\'\' was released through Scream in Japan exclusively.

===\'\'Communism Is Fascism\'\'===

2004 saw the band releasing their second demo album \'\'Fuck That Celebrity Trash & Your Ghetto Cunt Drama\'\'. Shortly after the release of their second demo album, Undercover Slut signed to Apokalypse Records, opened their MySpace account on September 27, 2004, and released their first full length album \'\'Communism Is Fascism\'\' on December 24, 2004. leaving Apokalypse Records the following year, for a 2-record deal with [[Free-Will]] ([[Dir En Grey]]\'s label) in July 2005.

In interviews \'O\' often refers to their hometown as "Psychotic Paris, Fucked-up France".<ref>[http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/799/Undercover-Slut.html TheGauntlet.com Interview]</ref> Undercover Slut have toured the United States six times over six years; {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, tours of the United States are normally promoted as "[[Amerikkka]] Tour". Undercover Slut went through several record label changes in 2005 and 2006, first [[Free-Will (label)|Free-Will]], but the band left after becoming unhappy with the European label manager\'s work ethic.

February 2006 saw Undercover Slut sign to SixSixSix Records, a British label which was set up by former [[Christian Death]] manager Tim Fraser and [[Cradle Of Filth]] bassist [[Dave Pybus]]. During that period, the band performed live at London\'s Underworld and appeared on U.K. television show [[Redemption TV]]. SixSixSix Records being financially unable to produce and release any Undercover Slut recordings, \'O\' decided to leave this label to concentrate on his own record label: \'\'\'Offensive Records\'\'\'.

===The White Whore era and \'\'Amerikkka Macht Frei\'\'===

A full length record was planned for release in 2006 via [[Free-Will]]: \'\'Inside That Cult That Loves to Terror\'\', but this did not see the light of day.

\'O\' introduced new members into Undercover Slut, in the form of guitarist Divine, bassist Drag, and drummer Fake; this change was referred to as the band entering "The White Whore" era.

The thirteen track album, set to include a cover version of [[The Cure]]\'s "[[Killing an Arab]]", also features some guest musicians. Matthew Roberts ([[Charles Manson]]\'s son) is featured in a spoken word duet with \'O\' on the track "Jesus Kills! Coroner Saves!", [[Eric Griffin]] ([[Synical]], ex-[[Murderdolls]], [[Wednesday 13]]) plays lead guitar on the track "Kastration Kar Krashes" and Teddy Heavens (Rebel Rebel, Los Angeles Death Dolls) plays lead guitar on "Dali Was a Junkie".<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84296 Blabbermouth.net]</ref>

'''Vampire Rodents''' was the name of an [[industrial music]] and [[experimental rock]] band formed in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], although its core members originally came from [[Canada]]. The band was formed by singer, guitarist and composer [[Daniel Vahnke]] (aka Anton Rathausen) and keyboardist [[Victor Wulf]]. Andrea Akastia (violin, cello) joined after the re-release of ''[[War Music (Vampire Rodents album)|War Music]]'' in 1991. The band was well known for their use of guest vocalists on many of their songs. Although almost all of the instrumentalists credited, such as Jing Laoshu and Consuelo Buenviento, were fake.<ref>[http://themindofmicrowaved.blogspot.com/2007/06/vampire-rodentsether-bunny-interview.html Vampire Rodents/Ether Bunny Interview 2007!]. Daniel Vahnke interview. Retrieved on May 3, 2010.</ref> Daniel Vahnke was primarily influenced by classical and [[Avant-garde]] music, whereas Wulf was more focused on [[Ambient music]], and both styles contributed to the mood of the band.

Across their five album career, they appeared on four different record labels, including ''Dossier'', ''Vampire Rodents Productions'' (their own label), ''[[Re-Constriction Records]]'' and finally on ''Fifth Column''.

As well as Vampire Rodents, Vahnke also had a side project called [[Ether Bunny]], and Wulf had a solo effort called [[Dilate (musical project)|Dilate]], which released two albums on [[Cleopatra Records]]. The Rodents also collaborated with [[Babyland]] to create ''Recliner'', which released a few songs direct onto compilation albums, and later onto full VR albums.

While the band was mainly active during 1988-1996, Vahnke has expressed his desire on his Myspace page to restart the group, however there has been nothing new produced.

In January 2008, Daniel released on his Myspace page raw material from the proposed side project ''Pillow'' which was to be done in collaboration with [[16 Volt|16volt]].

\'\'\'\'\'Vomito Negro\'\'\'\'\' is a Belgian industrial band formed in 1983. The name is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "black vomit", a phenomenon that arises in the last stage of the disease [[yellow fever]].

==History==
After numerous successful releases like \'\'Shock\'\', \'\'Human\'\' and \'\'The New Drug\'\', and discontent with the result of their last studio album \'\'Fireball\'\', Gin Devo decided to put Vomito Negro aside for a while and to invest all his energy and creativity in his new project called Pressure Control and released the debut album \'\'Vamp\'\'. After only two more concerts Guy Van Mieghem sold his studio equipment and stopped all his musical activities since then. In 2008 Gin decided to bring back Vomito Negro. After asking BORG, who already was a member of Gin Devo\'s side project Pressure Control, to join the band. While they successfully toured Europe from 2008 until 2009, the duo started working on the new album. 

On January 22, 2010, the band released \'\'Skull & Bones\'\' through Out Of Line Records. Some of these new tracks like "Black Tie, White Shirt" and "Darkmoon" were already tested on the crowd of the WGT Festival, in Leipzig<ref>[http://www.gothicfestival.be Gothic Festival]</ref> and the Bimfest in [[Antwerp]].<ref>[http://www.bimfest.be]</ref>

In February 2010, just after its release, \'Skull & Bones\' entered the German Alternative Charts (DAC) on the tenth position, only to climbed further up to the second position one week later. Meanwhile the remake version of their club classic \'Move Your Body(V2K10)\',which is featured on the bonus disc of the limited edition version, entered the DAC\'s single charts shooting up to the 13th place.

In January 2013, the band released the album \'\'Fall of an Empire\'\'.

\'\'\'Whitehouse\'\'\' were a pioneering [[England|English]] [[Power electronics (music)|power electronics]] band formed in 1980, largely credited for the founding of the power electronics subgenre of [[industrial music]].

==History and personnel==
The name Whitehouse was chosen both in mock tribute to the British morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]], and in reference to a [[Whitehouse (magazine)|British pornographic magazine of the same name]].

The group\'s founding member and sole constant was William Bennett.  He began as a guitarist for [[Essential Logic]]. He wrote of those early years, "I often fantasised about creating a sound that could bludgeon an audience into submission."<ref>[http://www.susanlawly.freeuk.com/faq/faq.html Susanlawly.freeuk.com]</ref> Bennett later recorded as [[Come (UK band)|Come]] (featuring contributions from the likes of [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] and [[J. G. Thirlwell]]) before forming Whitehouse in 1980. The group began performing live in 1982. In 2009, Bennett claimed that his pre-eminent inspiration was [[Yoko Ono]]: "Yoko\'s amazing music was by far the biggest influence on me, and Whitehouse, in the formative years (despite what some would have you believe)."<ref>William Bennett, "The Inner Sleeve", \'\'The Wire\'\' 309, November 2009, p. 71.</ref>

[[Philip Best]] joined the group in 1982 at the age of 14, after running away from home. He was a member on and off ever since.

The group was inactive for the second half of the 1980s. A "special biographical note" on the Susan Lawly website states, "All members of Whitehouse went to live outside London for varying reasons and pursued separate lives. There was a feeling in the group that all that could be achieved had been realised."<ref>[http://www.susanlawly.freeuk.com/textfiles/ladossier4.html Susanlawly.freeuk.com]</ref>

Eventually, Whitehouse re-emerged with a series of [[album]]s, produced by the [[United States|American]] [[record producer]], [[Steve Albini]], beginning with 1990s \'\'[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (album)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]\'\'. Albini worked with the band until 1998, when Bennett took over all production duties.

Through the 1990s the most stable line-up was Bennett, Best, and the writer [[Peter Sotos]], who was convicted of possession of child pornography. Sotos left in 2002, leaving the band as a two-piece.

The band had numerous other members in the 1980s including [[Kevin Tomkins]], [[Steven Stapleton]], Glenn Michael Wallis, [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]], Stefan Jaworzyn, Jim Goodall, and [[Hafler Trio|Andrew McKenzie]], though many of these participated only at live performances, not on recordings.

Bennett terminated Whitehouse in 2008 to concentrate on his [[Cut Hands]] project.<ref>"[http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/william-bennett-cut-hands-interviewed Interview with William Bennett]". \'\'Decibel\'\', 8 July 2014.</ref>

==Music==
Whitehouse specialised in what they call "extreme electronic music". They were known for their controversial lyrics and imagery, which portrayed sadistic sex, rape, misogyny, serial murder, eating disorders, child abuse, neo-nazi fetishism and other forms of violence and abjection.

Whitehouse emerged as earlier [[industrial music|industrial]] acts such as [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[SPK (band)|SPK]] were pulling back from noise and extreme sounds and embracing relatively more conventional musical genres. In opposition to this trend, Whitehouse wanted to take these earlier groups\' sounds and fascination with extreme subject matter even further; as referenced on the sleeve of their first LP, the group wished to "cut pure human states" and produce "the most extreme music ever recorded". In doing so, they drew inspiration from some earlier experimental musicians and artists such as [[Alvin Lucier]], [[Robert Ashley]], and [[Yoko Ono]] as well as writers such as [[Marquis de Sade]].

The signature sonic elements on their early recordings were simple, pulverizing electronic bass tones twinned with needling high frequencies, sometimes combined with ferocious washes of white noise, with or without vocals (usually barked orders, sinister whispers, and high-pitched screams).

In the early 1990s the band phased out the analog equipment responsible for this sound, instead relying more heavily on computers. Since 2000 they began incorporating percussive rhythms, sometimes from African instruments such as the [[djembe]], both sampled and performed in-studio.

==Reception and influence==
Whitehouse were a key influence in the development of [[noise music]] as a musical genre in [[Europe]], [[Japan]], the [[United States|US]], and elsewhere. The early music of Whitehouse is often credited with pioneering the [[power electronics (music)|power electronics]] (a term Bennett himself coined on the blurb to the \'\'[[Psychopathia Sexualis (album)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]\'\' album) and noise genres.

The band\'s 2003 album [[Bird Seed (Whitehouse album)|\'\'Bird Seed\'\']] was given an \'honourable mention\' in the digital musics category of Austria\'s annual [[Prix Ars Electronica]] awards.<ref>[http://www.aec.at/en/archives/prix_archive/prix_year_cat.asp?iProjectID=9581&iCategoryID=9555 ARS Electronica<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As Nick Cain of \'\'[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]\'\' put it, {{cquote|By the end of the 1990s, power electronics was in a deep freeze. Fast forward a decade, and ... Whitehouse ... were enjoying an unlikely vogue, universally hailed by Noise makers from [[Peter Rehberg]] to [[Wolf Eyes]] ... and their work officially inducted into the avant garde canon through a collaboration with the German New Music ensemble [[Zeitkratzer]].<ref>Nick Cain, "Noise", \'\'The Wire Primers: A Guide to Modern Music\'\', Rob Young, ed., London: Verso, 2009, p. 31.</ref>}}

\'\'\'White Zombie\'\'\' was an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band that formed in 1985. Based in [[New York City]], White Zombie was originally a [[noise rock]] band. White Zombie is better-known for its later heavy metal-oriented sound. The group officially disbanded in 1998. In 2000, White Zombie was included on VH1\'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 56.<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists page] [[VH1]], cited January 18, 2010</ref>

==History==

===Early years===
White Zombie was co-founded by writer, vocalist and graphic artist [[Rob Zombie]], after coming up with the band idea in 1985 while attending [[Parsons School of Design]] in his junior year. Zombie\'s girlfriend at the time, [[Sean Yseult]], was the other co-founder. She had been playing the [[Farfisa]] keyboard in the band LIFE with [[Ivan de Prume]], but the band soon broke up. [[Paul Kostabi|Ena Kostabi]] owned a [[recording studio]], which he would rent out to different bands. When he met Yseult, she asked if he could teach her to play bass. They then recruited Peter Landau to play drums and began to write and record songs. White Zombie\'s first release, \'\'[[Gods on Voodoo Moon]]\'\', was an [[Extended play|EP]] and was recorded on October 18, 1985. It was released under the band\'s own label [[Silent Explosion]], under which they would release most of their early work. Only 300 copies were pressed, of which only 100 were sold; the band members still retain possession of the remaining 200.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1986, Zombie hired [[Tim Jeffs]], his Parsons School of Design roommate, to play guitar to replace Ena Kostabi, and Yseult brought in De Prume from their days in the band LIFE as the replacement for Landau. It was at this time the band started touring, making their live performance debut at [[CBGB]] on April 28, 1986.<ref>Tim Jeffs\' Early White Zombie Biography. cited July 6, 2009.</ref><ref>Yseult, Sean. "CBGB\'s". \'\'I\'m in the Band\'\'. 2010. pg. 8, cited January 9, 2011</ref> White Zombie released their second EP, \'\'[[Pig Heaven]]\'\', that year. The release contained two songs, "Pig Heaven" and "Slaughter the Grey". The EP was recorded at 6/8 Studios on Houston St and Bleecker St in NoHo in New York City. Other songs that were recorded during the session but never released were titled "Follow Wild", "Rain Insane", "Paradise Fireball" and "Red River Flow". After touring for a year in the band, Tim Jeffs left and was replaced by [[Tom Guay]], often known as Tom Five. The band released a second pressing of \'\'Pig Heaven\'\' with different cover art, but retained the same recording with Jeffs on guitar. Only 500 copies of each pressing were released on vinyl.

In 1987, the band released their third EP, \'\'[[Psycho-Head Blowout]]\'\'. Later that year, the band released their first full-length album, \'\'[[Soul-Crusher]]\'\', which was their first release to feature sound clips from movies in the songs, a trademark that would continue for the remainder of the band\'s lifespan. John Ricci replaced Tom Guay shortly after the release of \'\'Soul-Crusher\'\'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1988, the band signed to [[Caroline Records]], permanently discontinuing their old indie label. Their second album, \'\'[[Make Them Die Slowly (album)|Make Them Die Slowly]]\'\', was released in February 1989.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album was a musical shift for White Zombie. While their previous releases had been strictly punk-influenced noise rock, \'\'Make Them Die Slowly\'\' had more of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is also the first album crediting "Rob Zombie" instead of his previous [[stage name]], "Rob \'Dirt\' Straker".

Ricci\'s [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] severely affected his ability to play guitar, forcing him to leave the band when \'\'Make Them Die Slowly\'\' was finished. [[Jay Noel Yuenger|Jay Yuenger]], or "J", replaced him before the album\'s release, affecting their future sound.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20030820103658 |url=http://www.inyoureye.com/secure/whitezom/white_1.cfm |title="J. from White Zombie Speaks!"}}, cited June 12, 2010</ref> One of the most obvious examples of this direction is the difference between the songs "Disaster Blaster" on \'\'Make Them Die Slowly\'\' and the re-worked version, "Disaster Blaster II", on the \'\'[[God of Thunder (album)|God of Thunder]]\'\' EP.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Major label years===
After searching for a record label and being turned down multiple times, the band turned towards [[RCA Records]]. However, Zombie opted for a [[recording contract]] with [[Geffen Records]]. Michael Alago, a representative of Geffen, became interested after hearing \'\'God of Thunder\'\' and watched one of their shows at Pyramid Club and liked them, mostly for their song "Soul-Crusher". The band produced a [[demo (music)|demo]] with the help of [[J. G. Thirlwell]] of [[Foetus]] and were signed to Geffen.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/rob_zombie_i_find_it_distracting_to_hear_my_own_music.html "Rob Zombie: I Find It Distracting To Hear My Own Music"] ultimate-guitar.com interview. cited December 2008.</ref>

On March 17, 1992, White Zombie released \'\'[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1|La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One]]\'\', the album which launched them into mainstream recognition. White Zombie began a two-and-a-half-year-long tour for the album soon after its release, during which the band gained a large [[cult following]]. During the tour, [[Ivan de Prume]] left the band to pursue a successful career as a producer/engineer as well as drummer/percussionist and opened his own studio, Burningsound. He was replaced by Phil Buerstatte. The [[music video]] for the song "[[Thunder Kiss \'65]]" went into heavy rotation on [[MTV]] in 1993. The popular TV show \'\'[[Beavis and Butt-head]]\'\' began featuring their music videos, boosting the band\'s popularity.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> By the end of 1993, the album had been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. By the time the tour ended in December 1994, Zombie and Yseult had broken up, and \'\'La Sexorcisto\'\' had gone [[RIAA certification|platinum]]. Due to artistic differences, Buerstatte was let go, and [[John Tempesta]], who had previously worked with [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]], was hired to record White Zombie\'s second major label album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1995, \'\'[[Astro Creep: 2000]]\'\' was released, featuring the hit single "[[More Human than Human]]". In 1996, an album of remixes was released under the title \'\'[[Supersexy Swingin\' Sounds]]\'\'. After making one last song for the 1996 film \'\'[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]\'\', titled "Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls", White Zombie broke up in 1998.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==After disbanding==
After the breakup of White Zombie, Sean Yseult joined the [[surf rock]] band [[The Famous Monsters]], and started playing bass for horror-themed [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]-based band, [[Rock City Morgue]]. She also briefly played bass for [[The Cramps]].

Tempesta continued his musical relationship with Zombie, drumming for him on his first two solo albums, \'\'[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]\'\'. He is no longer with Zombie, and has gone on to play for [[Scum of the Earth (band)|Scum of the Earth]] with his brother, [[Powerman 5000]] guitarist Mike Tempesta, and ex-Zombie guitarist [[Mike Riggs]]. Tempesta has toured with Testament (as shown on Testament\'s DVD, \'\'Live In London\'\'). On February 14, 2006, he was hired as the new drummer for [[The Cult]], before which, he played with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]].

[[Jay Noel Yuenger|J.]] produced records for [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]] and [[New York City|New York]]-based Puny Human.

In July 2006, original members Tom Five and de Prume reunited to perform with de Prume\'s band, Healer, a middle eastern infused metal band, for several concerts in Southern California for The Vans [[Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|title=Original WHITE ZOMBIE Members Team Up For VANS WARPED TOUR Appearance|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|date=July 6, 2006 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|archivedate=October 26, 2006}}</ref> De Prume continues to write and record music with Healer, as well as recording, producing and engineering for special projects in his studio, Burningsound. His drums and percussion work can also be heard on Sony\'s "Ghost Rider" score. In 2009, de Prume began hosting the weekly radio show, "Metalopolis". His studio guests have included [[Rob Halford]], [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Max Cavalera]], [[Vinnie Paul]] and [[Tom Araya]]. De Prume is also a member of the band KREEP, and has completed a West Coast tour in spring 2010, and is planning an East Coast tour in fall 2010.

In November 2008, Geffen/UME released \'\'[[Let Sleeping Corpses Lie]]\'\', a [[boxed set]] which includes sixty four tracks featuring every White Zombie album and EP (except the remix albums), all remastered. The package also contained nine music videos (including their breakthrough Grammy-nominated hit "Thunder Kiss \'65"), and ten live performances. In an interview<ref>{{cite web|title=Rob Zombie: All Boxed Up|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Rob+Zombie%3A+All+Boxed+Up/|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]|author=Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna|date=December 3, 2008|accessdate= December 3, 2008|archiveurl=
//web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Rob+Zombie%3A+All+Boxed+Up/|archivedate=December 5, 2008}}</ref> to promote the release of \'\'Let Sleeping Corpses Lie\'\', Zombie made it clear that a reunion with his White Zombie band mates was unlikely, saying, "I don\'t want fans to think it\'s the beginning of anything."

In December 2010 Yseult released "I\'m in the Band", a book containing tour diaries and photos as well as detailing her eleven years spent as a member of White Zombie.<ref>[http://seanyseult.com/the-book/ The Book], September 9, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1593762992 I\'m In the Band Amazon page], September 9, 2010.</ref>

In June 2011, in an interview with \'\'[[Metal Hammer]]\'\' magazine, Rob Zombie was asked why White Zombie split up, in which he replied: "It had run its course. Success is a big thing that you can never plan for, because it affects everybody differently. I don\'t want to blame myself or anyone else in the band \xe2\x80\x94 it\'s just that the band didn\'t work anymore. Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it all fall apart, I thought: \'Let\'s just end it on a high point\'".

In May 2013, former drummer Phil Buerstatte died.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marc Hogan |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/phil-buerstatte-white-zombie-drummer-has-died/ |title=Phil Buerstatte, Former White Zombie Drummer, Dead at 44|publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 22, 2013|archiveurl=

\'\'\'The Young Gods\'\'\' (TYG) are a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Post-industrial music|post-industrial]] band from [[Fribourg]]. The band\'s lineup consisted of a trio composed by a vocalist, a keyboardist / sampler operator and a drummer. In 2007, a fourth member joined the band. Their instrumentation often includes sampled electric guitars, drums, keyboards, and other samples.<ref name="Bio"/> The lyrics are written in English, French and German.

==Biography==
Their name is taken from an early [[Young God (EP)|EP]] by the [[no wave]]/[[noise rock]] band [[Swans (band)|Swans]]. Artists influenced by The Young Gods include [[Pitchshifter]], [[Mike Patton]], [[Sepultura]], [[The Edge]] (as stated in [[U2 by U2]]), [[Devin Townsend]], [[Ithak]], [[Econoline Crush]] and [[David Bowie]]; asked in 1995 if his album \'\'[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]]\'\' was influenced by [[Nine Inch Nails]], Bowie answered: "The band that I was actually quite taken with was three guys from Switzerland called The Young Gods... I\xe2\x80\x99d been aware of them previous to knowing about Nine Inch Nails."

[[Roli Mosimann]] of Swans has worked with the group as a producer. In 2007 they did a [[Take-Away Show]] acoustic video session. Notable hits are: "[[Did You Miss Me?]]", "[[Envoy\xc3\xa9!]]", "[[Longue Route]]", "[[Skinflowers]]", and "[[Kissing the Sun]]".

In December 2012, The Young Gods give a small series of concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their first album (1987). The group will play songs from their first two albums ("The Young Gods" and "L\'eau rouge"). The line-up will be Franz Treichler (vocals), Bernard Trontin (drums) and Cesare Pizzi (samplers).

The group supplied original music for the 2012 animated short film, \'\'[[Kali the Little Vampire]]\'\', which went on to win over 20 international awards.<ref name=publico>{{cite web |url= http://www.publico.pt/culturaipsilon/noticia/unesco-da-estatuto-de-patrimonio-cultural-internacional-a-kali-o-pequeno-vampiro-de-regina-pessoa-1621729|title= Kali, o Pequeno Vampiro exibido enquanto "patrim\xc3\xb3nio cultural internacional" em festival da UNESCO|author= Lusa and P\xc3\x9aBLICO|date= January 30, 2014|accessdate= October 6, 2014|work= [[publico.pt]]|language= Portuguese}}</ref>

In 2003 he expanded his career and became a film director, and has directed a total of six films, the majority of which he also wrote or co-wrote. He has also released numerous brands of comic books, and appeared as an actor on numerous occasions.

White Zombie\'s debut album, \'\'[[Soul-Crusher]]\'\', was released in 1987 and was followed by their second album \'\'[[Make Them Die Slowly (album)|Make Them Die Slowly]]\'\' in 1989. They rose to prominence after the success of their third album, \'\'[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1]]\'\', and its lead single "[[Thunder Kiss \'65]]" in 1993. The album went on to be certified multi-platinum by the [[RIAA]], for sales exceeding two million copies in the US. Their fourth and final studio album, \'\'[[Astro-Creep: 2000 \xe2\x80\x93 Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head|Astro-Creep: 2000]]\'\', became their first top-10 entry on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], and their second album to reach multi-platinum status.

Zombie began his solo career with the release of his 1998 debut album \'\'[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]\'\'. The album was both a critical and commercial success, spawning three hit singles, reaching the Top 5 of the Billboard 200, and selling over three million copies worldwide. \'\'Hellbilly\'\' is Zombie\'s highest selling album to date. He followed the success of the album with \'\'[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]\'\' in 2001, which had similar success to that of its predecessor.

His fifth album, \'\'[[Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor]]\'\', was released on April 23, 2013.

Following his success as a musician, Zombie began directing, writing and producing films. His first film, \'\'[[House of 1000 Corpses]]\'\', was completed in 2000, but numerous struggles with the distributor led to the film\'s release being delayed until 2003. Its sequel, \'\'[[The Devil\'s Rejects]]\'\' was released in 2005. In 2007, he released his third film, a remake of the 1978 classic film \'\'[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]\'\'.
