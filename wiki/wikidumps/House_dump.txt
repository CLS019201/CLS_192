She released her debut single, \"[[Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)]]\", in late 2009, which peaked at number-eighteen in the [[Romanian Top 100]]. The song became known in her native country through the saxophone-dubb in its refrain, which was later used also in her next single, called \"[[Mr. Saxobeat]]\". It became her worldwide breakthrough hit, selling circa 10,000,000 copies in less than a year and reaching the charts' first position in nine countries, the top five in over thirty countries, such as [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]], and the top 10 in [[Australia]], and top 30 in [[Canada]] and [[United States]]. She released her debut album in August 2011, titled ''[[Saxobeats]]'', which sold in over four million shipments worldwide. The album spawned two more singles: \"[[Get Back (ASAP)|Get Back]]\" and \"[[1.000.000 (song)|1,000,000]]\", featuring rapper [[Carlprit]]. The records were top-forty successes in more [[Europe]]an countries like [[Italy]] or [[Bulgaria]].\n\nStan released \"[[Lemonade (Alexandra Stan song)|Lemonade]]\" as the lead single from the Japanese re-release of her debut album ''Saxobeats''. The song charted majorly and was certified Gold in [[Italy]] by the [[Federation of the Italian Music Industry]]. She then released \"[[Cliche (Hush Hush)]]\" as the follow-up to \"[[Lemonade (Alexandra Stan song)|Lemonade]]\" on 27 September 2012, and as the second single from the re-released album. The single failed to achieve the success of its predecessor. A collaboration with Manilla Maniacs for the song \"[[All My People]]\" was selected as the third and final single from the record. The song was released on 1 May 2013, with the latter two singles both receiving moderate success.\n\nStan's second studio album was released on August 27, 2014 exclusively in [[Japan]], under the label [[Victor Entertainment]]. ''[[Dance (Alexandra Stan song)|Dance]]'' and ''[[Cherry Pop]]'' are the record's lead singles. They became populary, when they both reached the first position in the [[Japan]]ese iTunes Chart. Stan revealed the international release of her album, \"[[Unlocked (Alexandra Stan album)|Unlocked]]\", on Facebook, already weeks before its worldwide release.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/AlexandraStanTheArtist]</ref> The album was released internationally on November 25, 2014 and it features a collaboration with [[Connect-R]] to the song ''[[Vanilla Chocolat]]''. The record sold in over 3.000 shipments in its first days after the release.\n\nStan has been reported to have a net worth of 20,000,000 \u20ac. She is also currently one of the wealthiest musical artists in [[Romania]] and [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>http://www.radio21.ro/muzica/stiri-din-muzica/alexandra-stan-in-topul-incasarilor-credidam</ref>"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"4412606":{"pageid":4412606,"ns":0,"title":"Alison Limerick","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist\n|name = Alison Limerick\n|image = \n|caption = \n|image_size = \n|background = solo_singer\n|birth_name = Alison T.

He is known for his energetic and danceable mix of grooves, as well as his enthusiastic interaction with the crowd.\n\nBiography Erick Eerdhuizen\n\nIt\u2019s 2011: ever-active Erick Eerdhuizen is passionate, dedicated and energetic when it comes to working on his career as a DJ, composer and producer.\n\nAfter winning \u2018The Dutch DMC Championships\u2019, in 1989, Erick was the official Dutch representative during the World Championships at The Royal Albert Hall in London.\nHe fell in love with a new music genre and consequently made considerable contributions to the upcoming Dutch house culture, creating for example house classics such as \u2018Pancake-Don\u2019t Turn Your Back\u2019, released on record label WORK.\n\nHe established his name as a DJ more firmly during the mid-nineties, landing the Saturday residency at the legendary Amsterdam Club RoXY. There, his infamous SWET nights caused long waiting lines at the door and it pushed Erick\u2019s popularity to new heights. He frequently graced the decks at the main stages of large festivals such as \u2018Dance Valley, \u2018Sensation\u2019 (international residency), \u2018Mysteryland\u2019, \u2018Day At The Park\u2019 and \u2018Extrema Outdoor\u2019. International clubs such as NOW & WOW Rotterdam, Amnesia Ibiza, Rex Paris and Catwalk Barcelona invited him repeatedly, knowing Erick would deliver a full house.\n\nWith an artistic brain and an insatiable lust for music he managed to gain success with international releases, top 10 chart positions, an impressive series of mix compilations and number 1 hit records. Now, a decade into the new century, he\u2019s mostly known as DJ Erick E and he considers himself to be fortunate: Erick won the people\u2019s vote and is leading the number one spot at \u2018DJGuide.nl\u2019 for the last 3 consecutive years.\n\nIn 2010, DJ performances had changed drastically and Eerdhuizen found himself longing for a different approach. A strong desire to return to a basis, founded at Club RoXY, kept growing. He craved for longer sets (\u2018all nighters\u2019) and a more intimate playground, where he could perform a mix of \u2018warm tech-house\u2019 and \u2018danceable techno\u2019.\nThe introduction of E5H \u2013 meaning Erick E 5 Hours \u2013 gave him the chance to control the night from the first until the very last record played. He took the challenge and conquered a demanding crowd during his first E5H gigs at the \u2018Amsterdam Sugar Factory, Bunker NDSM and Westerunie\u2019. Now, the E5H-tour has officially started around smaller venues and popstages, playing \u2018De Effenaar Eindhoven, Paard van Troje The Hague, Mezz Breda and Patronaat Haarlem\u2019 amongst others.\nIn 2011, Eerdhuizen will add a new branch to the tree. Next to his tour, the last 6 months were all about the joy of making music and studio time, where passion and inspiration ran wild. New collabs, steamy productions and the birth of \u2018SMAAKSTOF\u2019 - a brand new record label - are at hand. The first releases under his \u2018tech-house\u2019 alias Eerdhuizen are scheduled for spring, so \u2026better tie your shoe laces and brace yourselves for energy, substance and unbridled passion: Erick Eerdhuizen is going back to basics!"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"1836257":{"pageid":1836257,"ns":0,"title":"Erick Morillo","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist <!-- For individuals; see Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Erick Morillo\n| image               = 10.11.12ErickMorilloByLuigiNovi1.jpg\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = Erick Morillo in the dedication ceremony, October 2012\n| image_size          = \n| background          = non_performing_personnel\n| birth_name          = Erick Morillo\n| alias               = \n| birth_date          = {{birth year and age|1971|mf=yes}}<ref name=AllMusic>Birchmeier, Jason.

The following decade Gregory worked as a resident dj in numerous popular clubs in the south of France until  the summer of 1998, where  he met the world famous [[Joe Claussell]] of Body & Soul, from New York City, while Joe was on tour in France.  After that meeting Gregory decided to pursue his interest in electronic music and moved to San Francisco.\n\nIn 2000, through the club scene and Mauricio Aviles, he was introduced to Israel Megerssa the owner of Zebra Records.  Israel took Gregory under his wing and hired him as a house music buyer at Zebra Records Music store.  More than a father figure, Israel was a spiritual guide to Gregory and told Gregory that he should start getting into music production.  That will mark the beginning of a 4 year collaboration with the keyboardist and sound engineer Charles Spencer where Gregory began producing his signature sound \u2013 [[Soul music|soulful]] [[house music]].\n\nIn 2001, Gregory's first single, titled \"Don't Hesitate\", was signed by the label Subliminal Records and since then he has produced some of the most influential and cutting-edge \"master pieces\" in the industry, such as his remix for [[Miguel Migs]] & [[Jay-J]] \"Friend of the Blues\" on Black Vinyl, \"Won\u2019t Stop\" featuring Latrice Barnett, \"Each Other\" featuring Paris Brightledge and the timeless classic \"Anytime\".\n\nIn 2006, with the help of the digital era and download sites like Traxsource and Beatport, Gregory started his own independent record label Del Records.  He released his first artist album \" I Love You More\", that got acclaimed in the Dance music industry and abroad by the likes of [[Stuart Matthewman]] ([[Sade Adu|Sade]]) and [[CeCe Rogers]] ([[Jestofunk]]).  Gregory and \"I Love You More\" were granted with a front page cover and a full page interview on the oldest UK Dance magazine [[M8 (magazine)|M8]] ([[Tilllate Magazine]]).\n\nIn 2010 Gregory has become one of the most prolific producers in the soulful side of the scene and has already produced and remixed such artists as Byron Stingily (Ten City), Susu Bobien, Keith Thompson (Raze/Break For Love), Jojo Haley, Pepper Mashay, Stephanie Cooke, Latrice Barnette, Michelle weeks, Billy Love, Bill \"The Buddah\" Dickens and Kenny Bobien amongst others. \n \nGregory has been performing as a DJ in all major events in San Francisco, and also abroad in [[Detroit]], [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Dubai]], [[Bratislava]], [[Copenhagen]], but as with many independent producers, the worldwide economic recession and the significant increase of illegal downloads, gradually slid Gregory's career into just a hobby."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"30557015":{"pageid":30557015,"ns":0,"title":"Greg Stainer","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name = Greg Stainer\n| image = Greg Stainer DJing in 2012.jpg\n| caption = Greg Stainer DJing in 2012\n| image_size =\n| background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| birth_name = Greg Peter Stainer\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1976|5|17}}<br />London, England\n| death_date =\n| origin =\n| instrument =\n| genre = [[Electronic dance music|Electronic dance]], [[tech house]], [[progressive house]], [[electro house]], [[house music|house]]\n| occupation = [[Electronic musician|Musician]], disc jockey, record producer\n| years_active = 1999\u2013present\n| label = [[Universal Music Group]], [[EMI]], [[Stained Music]], [[Stealth Records]] [[Hed Kandi]] <small>(2010)\n| website = {{url|gregstainer.com}}\n| Twitter = {{url|twitter.com/gregstainer}}\n}}\n'''Greg Stainer''' (born in London, England) is a British [[House music]] & [[Electronic Dance Music]] DJ, producer and [[remix]] artist who now resides in [[Dubai]].

He is primarily identified with the [[house music]] scene in San Francisco, California, where he resides, but DJs widely around the world.\n\nShortly after Mark befriended [[Derrick Carter]] in 1988 at a record store in Chicago, he developed an interest in House music. Mark experimented with a deeper style, dropping De La Soul, disco classics and other styles not being played in the main rooms of nightclubs. While exploring purist forms of House Music, Mark developed his trademark style, known as \"Mushroom Jazz\": acid jazz infused with the West Coast's jazzy, organic productions along with urban beats. Fans embraced Mark's downtempo style, and he started a weekly Mushroom Jazz club night in San Francisco with Patty Ryan. In 3 years at the club, Farina and Mushroom Jazz established a following. When the club closed, Farina continued the tradition by releasing a series of CDs under the same name, ''Mushroom Jazz''. Since then, Mark has been performing hundreds of shows worldwide each year. His House sets have been described as the jazzy side of Chicago House mixed San Francisco style. Some of his sets have been known to last up to 8 hours. Farina has been known to play two different rooms at the same party.

He possesses [[perfect pitch]] and musical total recall, also known as [[eidetic memory]]. He is of [[Trinidadian]] and [[Jewish]] heritage.\n\nSelan has collaborated extensively with [[\"Little\" Louie Vega]] and [[Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzales]] of the house music production team [[Masters at Work]]. Notably he plays the extended keyboard improvisation on the [[Masters at Work]] remix of [[Nina Simone]]'s \"[[See-Line Woman]]\" which appears on the highly successful 2002 [[Verve Remixed]] collection. He also plays the extended keyboard solos on the [[DJ Spinna]] remix of [[Betty Carter]]'s \"Naima's Love Song\" which appears on the 2003 follow-up [[Verve Remixed]] 2 collection. Selan co-wrote the music for most of [[DJ Spinna]]'s Intergalactic Soul album, which was released in 2006 on [[Shanachie]] Records. He also co-produced, co-wrote and was a featured artist on \"Back 2 U\", a standout track on that same album.\n\nHis 2004 single \"Unconditional Love,\" produced by DJ Spinna, was released on the Wonderwax record label. Selan's solo single \"Gravity\" was released in 2005 on Louie Vega's Vega Records. He is the co-writer of the song \"Focus\" which appears on [[Concrete Rose]], the multi-platinum 2004 album by American [[R&B]] singer [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]]. He also appears as a co-writer on the songs \"Marathon\" and \"Desire\" which appear on the 2007 [[Grammy]]-nominated second album [[Love Behind the Melody]] by [[Raheem DeVaughn]].\n\nAs a side musician, he has performed with Adele, Alejandro Sanz, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, R&B singer Joe, Stevie Wonder and Roy Ayers just to name a few. He's recorded with and/or for Kanye West, Aaliyah, David Byrne, Earth, Wind and Fire, R. Kelly, Musiq Soulchild and many others. Selan's keyboard work on the house remix for Curtis Mayfield's \"Superfly\" helped DJ/producer Louie Vega win the 2006 Grammy award for BEST REMIX.  He has been a member of Little Louie Vega's Elements of Life Band and also plays keyboards and sings background for the classic disco/R&B group CHIC featuring Nile Rodgers.\n\nAfter being traveling as part of Adele's band from January 2009-July 2009, Selan joined the classic r&b/disco band, Chic featuring Nile Rodgers. He played keyboards and sang background.\n\nIn September 2011, Selan joined the house band as a keyboardist, vocalist and trumpet player for [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s \"The Rosie Show\" which aired on [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s OWN network. It was cancelled in March 2012.\n\nOn August 8, 2012 Selan released his debut album, \"Space Flight\", which features contributions from legendary producer/guitarist/songwriter and artist [[Nile Rodgers]], [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]] fame, [[M-1 (rapper)|M1]] from the revolutionary hip-hop group [[Dead Prez]], Grammy-nominated recording artist [[Emily King]] and Melissa Jimenez.\n\n2013 was a big year for Nile Rodgers, who wound up winning 3 Grammys for his work on Daft Punk's album, \"Random Access Memories\". All of the frenzy surrounding the song \"Get Lucky\" brought a very high visibility to Chic and as well as to Nile himself. The band toured all over the world rejuvenating Nile's career and introducing him to a younger generation.

Their name means \"deep black\" in German, and is a combination of the brothers' surnames, and their love of deep house.\n\nTheir earliest productions were released on the Continuemusics label in 1997, and their first taste of a well-respected label was with their ''Music'' track on [[Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian]]'s [[Wave Music]] label in 1999. The team released their first album, ''RAL9005'' on the [[Four Music]] label in 2001, which was later licensed to [[Derrick Carter]] and [[Luke Solomon]]'s [[Classic Recordings]] label. Tiefschwarz continued to release on Classic until its collapse in 2005, as well as releasing on labels such as Fine and [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]].\nMany of their tracks have been licensed to compilations, from the [[Stereo Sushi]] series, to compilations for [[Bugged Out!]], [[Get Physical]] and [[Renaissance (club)|Renaissance]], and in 2006, they released [[Fabric 29|a mix of their own]] for the [[Fabric (club)|Fabric]] (London) [[Fabric mix albums|mix series]].\n\nTheir sound is considered, at least by those who have followed them from their Classic days, to have changed somewhat over the last few years. Instead of their original deep, mellow house, Tiefschwarz now represent a gritty and edgy electro house sound, their more recent tracks gaining recognition from the likes of [[Ivan Smagghe]], Touch\u00e9, [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] and [[Danny Howells]].\n\nAli and Basti Schwarz have been travelling Europe as DJs since 1995, playing at major events and popular clubs all over Germany and Switzerland, as well as making appearances in Ibiza.  They've performed in cities as far afield as Miami, New York, Melbourne, Sydney, Amsterdam, Sarajevo, London, Antwerp and Stockholm.\n\nTiefschwarz have composed remixes for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Get Together (Madonna song)|Get Together]]'', [[Missy Elliott]]'s ''[[Teary Eyed]]'' and [[Depeche Mode]]'s single, ''[[John the Revelator / Lilian|John the Revelator]]''.\n\n2007 sees a return to a deeper house sound as shown in their 10 years anniversary compilation; ''10 Years Of Blackmusik''.\n\nIn January and July 2011 Tiefschwarz performed at the legendary aftershow party of the [[StyleNite]], a cultural event of the designer [[Michael Michalsky]] during Berlin Fashion Week."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"316044":{"pageid":316044,"ns":0,"title":"The Timelords","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#redirect [[Time Lord]]"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"892372":{"pageid":892372,"ns":0,"title":"Ti\u00ebsto","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n|name = Ti\u00ebsto\n|image = DJ Ti\u00ebsto.jpg\n|caption =\n|image_size = 240px\n|landscape = yes\n|background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n|birth_name = Tijs Michiel Verwest\n|alias = Allure (until 2011), Steve Forte Rio, Da Joker, DJ Limited, DJ Ti\u00ebsto, Drumfire, Handover Circuit, Boys Will Be Boys, Passenger, Roze, Stray Dog, Tom Ace, TST, Wild Bunch<ref name=\"discogs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/447026-Tijs-Verwest |title=Tijs Verwest Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=1969-01-17 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>\n|birth_date = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1969|1|17}}\n|birth_place = [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]]<ref>[http://www.tiesto.com/Tiesto-professional-life ARTIST].

The music is written and produced by Jez Willis and Tim Garbutt, who were joined on-stage by other musicians when the band played live from 1991 to 2001, since then they have performed as DJs. The band had three top ten singles in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the 1990s,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> and were notable for their use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] technology \u2013 in particular, their practice of manipulating samples from mainstream pop and rock songs and combining them with contrasting dance beats, using samples in new contexts. They had 3 further UK top 40 singles in 2000 \u2013 2001, a top 10 single in 2008 and a top 30 single in 2012.\n\nThey have DJed throughout their career, mainly in Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand averaging a minimum of 80 gigs a year.\n\nDue to their genre crossing sets, Utah Saints have never been fully immersed in any one scene, other than the general electronic dance field. As a result they have performed at a wide range of events, ranging from underground electronic clubs to headlining festival stages, including their legendary headline set at Wickerman Festival in Scotland in 2009, which was nominated as a standout festival moment in the UK festival awards. They also were voted 2nd best dance act at Glastonbury (1st was Fatboy Slim) by NME magazine in 2000."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"2383136":{"pageid":2383136,"ns":0,"title":"Vernessa Mitchell","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n'''Vernessa Ann Mitchell''' (born January 1, 1959) is an American contemporary Christian and gospel recording artist whose vocal versatility has been heralded by R&B and House audiences."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"2201068":{"pageid":2201068,"ns":0,"title":"Victor Calderone","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Victor Calderone\n| image                 = Victor_Calderone.jpg\n| caption            = \n| image_size            = \n| background          = non_performing_personnel\n| birth_name          = \n| alias               = \n| birth_date                = {{Birth date and age|1967|3|20}}\n| death_date                = \n| origin              = [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York]], [[United States]]\n| instrument          = \n| genre               = [[House music|House]] [[Techno]]\n| occupation          = Disc Jockey (DJ) and producer\n| years_active        = 1980s\u2013present\n| label               = [[Waveform Recordings]]\n| associated_acts     = \n| website                 = http://www.victorcalderone.com/\n| current_members     = \n| past_members        = \n| notable_instruments =\n}}\n\n'''Victor Calderone''' (born March 20, 1967<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#!/profile.php?v=info&ref=hpbday&id=890555509 ''Victor's official Facebook page''] on ''[[Facebook]]''</ref> in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]]) is a [[house music]] producer, [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[remix]]er."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"26980258":{"pageid":26980258,"ns":0,"title":"Vika Jigulina","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Vika Jigulina\n| image               = \n| alt                 = \n| caption             = \n| image_size          = \n| background          = solo_singer\n| birth_name          = Victoria Corneva\n| alias               = \n| birth_date          = {{Birth date and age|1986|02|18}}\n| birth_place         = [[Cahul]], [[Republic of Moldova]]\n| origin              = [[Bucharest]], Romania\n| instrument          = [[Vocals]], [[guitar]], [[piano]]\n| genre               = [[Electronic music|Electronic]]\n| occupation          = [[Record producer|Music producer]], [[singer]], [[disc jockey|DJ]] \n| years_active        = 2000\u2013present\n| label               = [[Cat Music]], Mayavin Records, Stereo Tunes Records (UK)\n| associated_acts     = [[Edward Maya]]\n| website             = {{url|http://www.vikajigulina.com/}}\n| notable_instruments = \n}}\n\n'''Vika Jigulina''' (born February 18, 1986) is a [[Moldova]]n born-[[Romania]]n music producer, singer, and disc jockey."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"32607258":{"pageid":32607258,"ns":0,"title":"Vinyl Scratch","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#REDIRECT [[List of mainline My Little Pony ponies#Unicorn Ponies]]\n[[Category:Fictional disc jockeys]]\n[[Category:Fictional unicorns]]"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"5736473":{"pageid":5736473,"ns":0,"title":"Wamdue Project","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#REDIRECT [[Chris Brann]]"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"34305548":{"pageid":34305548,"ns":0,"title":"Way Out West (musicians)","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#REDIRECT [[Way Out West (group)]]"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"3318027":{"pageid":3318027,"ns":0,"title":"Warren Clarke","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Use British English|date=June 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox person\n|image = <!-- only free-content images are allowed for depicting living people.
