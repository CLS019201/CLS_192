\'\'\'Michael Joseph Jackson\'\'\'<ref name="Legal name"/><ref name=allmusic/> (August 29, 1958 \xe2\x80\x93 June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor.

An MTV spokeswoman denies that, but the phrase was part of MTV\'s ads for the video and was repeatedly used by its VJs. A source at Fox confirms that Jackson\'s people did request that [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] use the phrase "King of Pop" in the video and that the phrase also be used in the network\'s press releases; \'King of Pop\' also crops up in Fox\'s print ads for the video and in press releases by Jackson\'s publicists, [[Lee Solters|Solters]]/Roskin/Friedman. | first=David | last=Browne}}</ref><ref>"He wears the crown as the King Of Pop because no artist has broken his record of selling nearly 60 million copies of a single Album (Thriller)", in Lewis, p. 3</ref> his contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.

The eighth child of the [[Jackson family]], he debuted on the professional music scene along with his elder brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] as a member of [[the Jackson 5]] in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in [[popular music]]. The music videos for his songs, including those of "[[Beat It]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new television channel [[MTV]] to fame. With videos such as "[[Black or White]]" and "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]", he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the [[robot (dance)|robot]] and the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-disco]], [[contemporary R&B]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[rock music|rock]] artists.

Jackson\'s 1982 album \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\' is the [[List of best-selling albums|best selling album of all time]].

Aspects of Jackson\'s personal life, including his changing [[Michael Jackson\'s health and appearance|appearance]], [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson|personal relationships]], and behavior, generated controversy.

The videocassette of the documentary \'\'The Making of Michael Jackson\'s Thriller\'\' sold over 350,000 copies in a few months. The era saw the arrival of novelties like dolls modeled after Michael Jackson, which appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.<ref name="TIME"/> Biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]] writes that, "\'\'Thriller\'\' stopped selling like a leisure item\xe2\x80\x94like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie\xe2\x80\x94and started selling like a household staple."<ref name="tara 226"/> In 1985, \'\'The Making of Michael Jackson\'s Thriller\'\' won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Longform.<ref name = "MJ Grammy\'s"/> \'\'Time\'\' described Jackson\'s influence at that point as "Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too".<ref name=TIME/> \'\'The New York Times\'\' wrote that, "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else".<ref name="NYTimes"/>

A defining point in Jackson\'s career took place on March 25, 1983, when Michael reunited with his brothers for a legendary live performance, which was taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, for  \'\'[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]\'\', an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of {{Nowrap|47 million}} viewers, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars.<ref name=Pasadena>{{cite web|first=Janette|last=Williams|url= http://www.whittierdailynews.com/general-news/20090625/michael-jackson-left-indelible-mark-on-pasadena |title=Michael Jackson left indelible mark on Pasadena|publisher=Whittier (Calif.)

===1984\xe2\x80\x9385: Pepsi, "We Are the World", and business career===
By the mid-1980s Jackson\'s award-winning musical career contributed to his commercial appeal, which proved to be substantial. In November 1983 Jackson, along with his brothers, partnered with [[PepsiCo]] in a $5 million promotional deal that broke advertising industry records for a celebrity endorsement. The first [[Pepsi]] campaign, which ran in the United States from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included advertising, tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson, who was actively involved in creating the iconic [[Pepsi]] advertisement, suggested using his song, "Billie Jean", as its musical jingle with a revised chorus.<ref name=Herrera2>{{cite web | last =Herrera | first =Monica| title =Michael Jackson, Pepsi Made Marketing History | work = Billboard  | date =July 3, 2009 | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268213/michael-jackson-pepsi-made-marketing-history?page=0%2C0 | accessdate =January 31, 2014}}</ref> According a \'\'Billboard\'\' report in 2009, Brian J. Murphy, executive VP of branded management at TBA Global, commented, "You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t separate the tour from the endorsement from the licensing of the music, and then the integration of the music into the Pepsi fabric."<ref name=Herrera2/>

On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi Cola commercial that was overseen by executive [[Phil Dusenberry]],<ref name="nytt"/> a [[BBDO]] ad agency executive, and [[Alan Pottasch]], Pepsi\'s Worldwide Creative Director, at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. In front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson\'s hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars on his scalp, and had his third [[rhinoplasty]] shortly thereafter.<ref name = "tara 205\xe2\x80\x93210"/> Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated his $1.5&nbsp;million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California. Its Michael Jackson Burn Center is named in his honor.<ref name="tara 279\xe2\x80\x93287"/> Dusenberry later recounted the episode in his memoir, \'\'Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising\'\'. Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for a reported $10 million. The second campaign had a global reach to more than twenty countries and provided financial support for Jackson\'s \'\'Bad\'\' album and his world tour in 1987\xe2\x80\x9388.<ref name=Herrera2/> Although Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as [[L.A.

Unlike later albums, \'\'Thriller\'\' did not have an official tour to promote it, but the  [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]] of 1984 headlined The Jacksons and showcased much of Jackson\'s new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he would do with his brothers.<ref name="taraborrelli320">Taraborrelli, p. 320</ref> Following a controversy over the concert\'s ticket sales, Jackson held a press conference and announced that he would donate his share of the proceeds from the Victory Tour, an estimated {{Nowrap|$3 to 5 million}}, to charity.<ref name="taraborrelli314">Taraborrelli, p. 314</ref><ref name="taraborrelli6"/> Jackson\'s charitable work and humanitarian awards continued with the release of "[[We Are the World]]" (1985), which he co-wrote with [[Lionel Richie]].<ref name="WATW Grammys">{{cite web  | title =Past Winners Search| publisher = The Recording Academy | year =2014 | url = http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&field_nominee_work_value=%22We+Are+The+World%22&year=All&genre=All | accessdate =January 29, 2014}}</ref> Released worldwide in March 1985 to aid the poor in the United States and Africa, the song earned $63 million for famine relief,<ref name="jdoyle"/> and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 20&nbsp;million copies sold. "We Are the World" won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year going to Jackson and Richie as its co-songwriters.<ref name="WATW Grammys"/> Although the American Music Award directors removed the charity song from the competition because they felt it would be inappropriate, the AMA show in 1986 concluded with a tribute to the song in honor of its first anniversary. (The song was recorded on January 28, 1985).<ref name="AMAs 1986"/> The project\'s creators received two special AMA honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the [[USA for Africa]] idea.

Jackson\'s financial interests in the music publishing business expanded after collaborating with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s. He subsequently learned that McCartney made approximately $40 million a year from other people\'s songs.<ref name="jdoyle"/> By 1983 Jackson had begun investing in publishing rights to songs that others had written, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s early acquisitions of [[music catalog]]s and song copyrights such as the [[Sly Stone]] collection included "Everyday People" (1968), [[Len Barry]]\'s [[1-2-3 (Len Barry song)|"1\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x933"]] (1965), and [[Dion DiMucci]]\'s "[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]" (1961) and "[[Runaround Sue]]" (1961); however, Jackson\'s most significant purchase came in 1985, when he acquired the publishing rights to [[ATV Music Publishing#Acquisition|ATV Music Publishing]] after months of negotiation.<ref name="jdoyle"/> ATV had acquired the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including the [[Northern Songs]] catalog that contained the majority of the [[Lennon\xe2\x80\x93McCartney]] compositions recorded by [[The Beatles]].<ref name="hilburn"/>

In 1984, [[Robert Holmes \xc3\xa0 Court]], the wealthy Australian investor who owned ATV Music Publishing, announced he was putting the ATV catalog up for sale.<ref name="hilburn"/> In 1981,<ref name="tara 333-338"/> McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for \xc2\xa320 million ($40 million).<ref name="jdoyle"/><ref name="mcca atv"/> According to McCartney, he contacted [[Yoko Ono]] about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at \xc2\xa310 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for \xc2\xa35 million each.<ref name="jdoyle" /><ref name="mcca atv" /> When they were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney, who did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles\' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own.<ref name = "tara 333-338"/><ref name="mcca atv"/> According to a negotiator for Holmes \xc3\xa0 Court in the 1984 sale, "We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn\'t want it at that time."<ref name="ch7news"/>

Jackson was first informed about the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984.<ref name="hilburn"/> An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly said "It\'s too pricey",<ref name="jdoyle"/><ref name = "tara 333-338"/> but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984.<ref name="hilburn"/> His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson\'s team walked away from talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of [[due diligence]] work on the negotiations.<ref name="hilburn"/> In June 1985 Jackson and Branca learned that [[Charles Koppelman]]\'s and [[Marty Bandier]]\'s The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes \xc3\xa0 Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes \xc3\xa0 Court\'s team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music.<ref name="hilburn" /> Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes \xc3\xa0 Court in Australia, where he would appear on the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon]].<ref name="ch7news"/> Jackson\'s [[ATV Music Publishing#Acquisition|purchase of ATV Music]] was finalized on August 10, 1985.<ref name="hilburn"/>

{{See also|Michael Jackson\'s health and appearance}}
Jackson\'s skin had been a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the mid-1980s, it gradually grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that he might be bleaching his skin.<ref name="campbell (1995) 14-16"/> According to [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]]\'s biography, in 1986, Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]] which Taroberrelli noted, may be a consequence of skin bleaching. Taraborelli claimed Jackson was diagnosed with [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]]; the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]; both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight. The treatments he used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he could appear very pale.<ref name="Taraborrelli"/> Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy though not with lupus.<ref name="Michael Jackson case report"/>

Jackson claimed that he had only two rhinoplasties and no other surgery on his face, although at one point he mentioned having a dimple created in his chin. Jackson lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for "a dancer\'s body".<ref name="jackson 229-230" /> Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]]; periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life.<ref name="tara 312\xe2\x80\x93313"/>

During the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his dermatologist, Dr. [[Arnold Klein]], and Klein\'s nurse [[Debbie Rowe]]. Rowe eventually became Jackson\'s second wife and the mother of his two eldest children. He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and business advice.<ref name="Michael Jackson Secret Boyfriend Claims Draw Fury"/>

Jackson became the subject of increasingly sensational reports. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. Although the claim was untrue, according to tabloid reports that are widely cited, Jackson had disseminated the fabricated story himself.<ref name="BBC, Jackson\'s image problems"/> When Jackson bought a chimpanzee called [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]] from a laboratory, he was reported to be increasingly detached from reality.<ref name="Is Michael Jackson for Real?"/> It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of [[Joseph Merrick]] (the "elephant man") and although untrue, Jackson did not deny the story.<ref name = "tara 355-361"/> Although initially he saw these stories as opportunities for publicity, he stopped leaking untruths to the press as they became more sensational.

<blockquote>Why not just tell people I\'m an alien from Mars? Tell them I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight. They\'ll believe anything \'\'you\'\' say, because \'\'you\'re a reporter\'\'. But if I, Michael Jackson, were to say, "I\'m an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight," people would say, "Oh, man, that Michael Jackson is \'\'nuts\'\'. He\'s cracked up. You can\'t believe a single word that comes out of his mouth."<ref name="taraborrelli9"/></blockquote>

Jackson collaborated with [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] on the 17-minute [[3-D film]] \'\'[[Captain EO]]\'\', which debuted in September 1986 at both the original [[Disneyland]] and at [[EPCOT]] in Florida, and in March 1987 at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Euro Disneyland]] after that park opened in 1992. All four parks\' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation was the last one to close, in 1998.<ref name="Nelson George overview 41"/> The attraction would later return to Disneyland in 2010 after Jackson\'s death.<ref name="Captain EO is Back to Change the World \xe2\x80\x93 Movies News at IGN"/>

In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the [[Jehovah\'s Witnesses]], in response to their disapproval of the \'\'Thriller\'\' video.<ref name="ebony1"/> With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson\'s first album in five years, \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\' (1987), was highly anticipated.<ref name="TIME2"/> It did not top \'\'Thriller\'\' as a commercial or artistic triumph, but \'\'Bad\'\' was still a substantial success in its own right.

[[File:Michael Jackson-3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jackson performing in 1988]]
The \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\' album spawned seven hit singles in the U.S., five of which ("[[I Just Can\'t Stop Loving You]]", "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", "[[Man in the Mirror]]" and "[[Dirty Diana]]") reached number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 charts.

In March 1988, Jackson purchased land near [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]], California, to build [[Neverland Ranch]] at a cost of $17 million.

As of 2013, the album has shipped seven million copies in the U.S. and has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/><ref name="Dangerous 32 million copies worldwide"/><ref name="New jack swing"/> In the United States, the album\'s first single "[[Black or White]]" was its biggest hit, reaching number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot; 100 and remaining there for seven weeks, with similar chart performances worldwide.<ref name="KOP achievements"/> The album\'s second single "[[Remember the Time]]" spent eight weeks in the top five in the United States, peaking at number three on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 singles chart.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/> At the end of 1992, \'\'Dangerous\'\' was awarded the best-selling album of the year worldwide and "Black or White" was awarded best-selling single of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards. Additionally, he won an award as best-selling artist of the 1980s.<ref name="Best 1992"/> In 1993, Jackson performed the song at the [[Soul Train Music Awards]] in a chair, saying he had suffered an injury in rehearsals.<ref name="taraborrelli12"/> In the UK and other parts of Europe, "[[Heal the World]]" was the biggest hit from the album; it sold 450,000 copies in the UK and spent five weeks at number two in 1992.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/>

Jackson founded the [[Heal the World Foundation]] in 1992. The charity organization brought underprivileged children to Jackson\'s ranch to enjoy theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property. The foundation also sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. In the same year Jackson published his second book, the bestselling collection of poetry, \'\'[[Dancing the Dream]]\'\'. While it was a commercial success and revealed a more intimate side to Jackson\'s nature, the collection was mostly critically unacclaimed at the time of release. In 2009, the book was republished by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and was more positively received by some critics in the wake of Jackson\'s untimely death. The [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed {{Nowrap|$100 million}}. The tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5 million people in 70 concerts.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/><ref name="Jackson to Tour Overseas"/> He sold the broadcast rights to his \'\'Dangerous\'\' world tour to [[HBO]] for $20&nbsp;million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.<ref name="taraborrelli13"/>

Following the illness and death of [[Ryan White]], Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] at Bill Clinton\'s Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research.<ref name="Stars line up for Clinton celebration"/><ref name="Facing the music and the masses at the presidential gala"/> In a high-profile visit to Africa, Jackson visited several countries, among them [[Gabon]] and [[Egypt]].<ref name="Ebony"/> His first stop to Gabon was greeted with a sizable and enthusiastic reception of more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read, "Welcome Home Michael."<ref name=Ebony/> In his trip to [[C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire]], Jackson was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief.<ref name=Ebony/> He then thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed official documents formalizing his kingship and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.<ref name=Ebony/>

In January 1993, Jackson made a memorable appearance at the halftime show at [[Super Bowl XXVII]]. Because of dwindling interest during halftime in the years before, the NFL decided to seek big-name talent that would keep viewers and ratings high, with Jackson being selected because of his popularity and universal appeal.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/sports/football/30sandomir.html?_r=0 |title=How Jackson Redefined the Super Bowl |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref> It was the first Super Bowl where the audience figures increased during the half-time show to more than the game itself. The performance began with Jackson catapulting onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him. As he landed on the canvas, he maintained a motionless "clenched fist, standing statue stance", dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for a minute and a half while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and sang four songs: "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and "Heal the World". Jackson\'s \'\'Dangerous\'\' album rose 90 places up the album chart.<ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"/>

In February 1993, Jackson was given the "Living Legend Award" at the [[35th Grammy Awards]] in Los Angeles. "Black or White" was Grammy-nominated for best vocal performance. "Jam" gained two nominations: Best R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/> The \'\'Dangerous\'\' album won a Grammy for Best Engineered \xe2\x80\x93 Non Classical, awarding the work of Bruce Swedien and Teddy Riley. In the same year, Michael Jackson won three American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Album (\'\'Dangerous\'\'), Favorite Soul/R&B Single ("[[Remember the Time]]") and was the first to win the International Artist Award, for his global performances and humanitarian concerns.

===1993\xe2\x80\x9394: First child sexual abuse allegations and first marriage===
{{Main|1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson}}

Jackson gave a 90-minute interview to [[Oprah Winfrey]] on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of [[Joseph Merrick|the Elephant Man]], slept in a [[hyperbaric]] oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, stating for the first time that he had [[vitiligo]]. \'\'Dangerous\'\' re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.<ref name = "lewis 165-168"/><ref name = "campbell (1995) 14-16"/><ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/>

In the summer of 1993, Jackson was accused of [[child sexual abuse]] by a 13-year-old boy named Jordan Chandler and his father, [[Evan Chandler]], a dentist.<ref name="looking back on 1993"/><ref name="tara 485-486"/><ref name="tara 477-478"/> The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, and the singer initially refused. Jordan Chandler eventually told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him.<ref name="tara 496-498"/> Evan Chandler was tape-recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There\'s no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael\'s career will be over". Jordan\'s mother was, however, adamant at the time that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson\'s part.<ref name="tara 477-478"/> Jackson later used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer.<ref name = "tara 477-478"/> In January 1994, however, after investigation on allegations of extortion against the singer by Chandler, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged due to lack of cooperation from Jackson\'s camp and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks among other reasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-25/local/me-15027_1_civil-case |title=Boy\'s Father in Jackson\'s Case Won\'t Be Charged: Investigation: Singer claimed parent of alleged molestation victim tried to extort money from him.

In May 1994, Jackson married [[Lisa Marie Presley]], the daughter of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[Priscilla Presley]].

===1995\xe2\x80\x9399: \'\'HIStory\'\', second marriage, and fatherhood===
In 1995, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony\'s music publishing division creating [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]. Jackson retained half-ownership of the company, earned $95 million upfront as well as [[List of Sony/ATV Music Publishing artists|the rights to even more songs]].<ref name="1995 music deal"/><ref name="sonydeal"/> He then released the double album \'\'[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]\'\'.

In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance; the incident was caused by a stress-related [[panic attack]].<ref name="taraborrelli17"/> "[[Earth Song]]" was the third single released from \'\'HIStory\'\', and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for six weeks over Christmas 1995; it sold a million copies, making it Jackson\'s most successful single in the UK.<ref name = "Ultimate booklet 48\xe2\x80\x9350"/> The track "[[They Don\'t Care About Us]]" became controversial when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and other groups criticized its allegedly [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics.

The album was promoted with the successful [[HIStory World Tour]]. The tour began on September 7, 1996, and finished on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, and grossed a total of {{Nowrap|$165 million}}. The show, which visited five continents and 35 countries, became Jackson\'s most successful in terms of audience figures.<ref name="lewis 95-96"/> During the tour, Jackson married his [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson#Debbie Rowe|longtime friend]] [[Debbie Rowe|Deborah Jeanne Rowe]], a dermatology nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Rowe was approximately six months pregnant with the couple\'s first child at the time. Originally, Rowe and Jackson had no plans to marry, but Jackson\'s mother Katherine persuaded them to do so.<ref name="taraborrelli18"/> Michael Joseph Jackson Jr (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998.<ref name = "tara 580\xe2\x80\x93581"/><ref name="taraborrelli19"/> The couple divorced in 1999, and Jackson got full custody of the children.

In 1997, Jackson released \'\'[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]\'\', which contained remixes of hit singles from \'\'HIStory\'\' and five new songs.

===2000\xe2\x80\x9303: Label dispute and \'\'Invincible\'\'===
At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s.<ref name="AMAs Poll"/> Throughout 2000 and 2001, Jackson worked in the studio with Teddy Riley and [[Rodney Jerkins]], as well as other collaborators. These sessions would result in the album \'\'[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]\'\', released in October 2001. \'\'Invincible\'\' was Jackson\'s first full-length album in six years, and it would be the last album of new material he released while still alive. The release of the album was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him sometime in the early 2000s. Once he had the licenses, he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep all the profits. However, due to various clauses in the contract, the revert date turned out to be many years away. Jackson discovered that the attorney who represented him in the deal was also representing Sony.<ref name = "tara 610\xe2\x80\x93611"/> Jackson was also concerned about the fact that for a number of years, Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in their music catalog venture. Jackson feared that Sony might have a conflict of interest, since if Jackson\'s career failed, he would have to sell his share of the catalog at a low price.<ref name = "tara 614\xe2\x80\x93617"/> Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.<ref name = "tara 610\xe2\x80\x93611"/>

In September 2001, two [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary concerts]] were held at Madison Square Garden to mark the singer\'s 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured performances by [[M\xc3\xbda]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[NSYNC]], [[Destiny\'s Child]], [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]], Luther Vandross, and Slash, among other artists.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 50-53"/> The second of the two shows took place the night before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]].<ref name="guardian"/> After 9/11, Jackson helped organize the [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]] benefit concert at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. The concert took place on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song "[[What More Can I Give]]" as the finale.<ref name = "tara 614\xe2\x80\x93617"/> Jackson\'s solo performances were omitted from the televised version of the benefit concert, although he could still be seen singing background vocals. This omission happened because of contractual issues related to the earlier 30th Anniversary concerts: those concerts were boiled down into a two-hour TV special titled \'\'[[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration]]\'\' which debuted in November 2001.

In spite of the events preceding its release, \'\'Invincible\'\' came out in October 2001 to much anticipation. \'\'Invincible\'\' proved to be a hit, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 13&nbsp;million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the U.S.<ref name="RIAA certifications"/><ref name="KOP achievements"/> However, the sales for \'\'Invincible\'\' were lower than those of his previous releases, due in part to a lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.

{{Further|Living with Michael Jackson|People v. Jackson}}
[[File:Michael Jackson in Vegas cropped-2.jpg|thumb|right|Jackson in Las Vegas, 2003]]
Beginning in May 2002, Jackson allowed a documentary film crew, led by British TV personality [[Martin Bashir]], to follow him around nearly everywhere he went. Bashir\'s film crew was with Jackson during the "baby-dangling incident" in Berlin. The program was broadcast in March 2003 as \'\'[[Living with Michael Jackson]]\'\'.

In a particularly controversial scene, Jackson was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a young boy.<ref name="tara 640"/> As soon as the documentary aired, the Santa Barbara county attorney\'s office began a criminal investigation. After an initial probe from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and [[Child Protective Services|DCFS]] was conducted in February 2003, they had initially concluded that molestation allegations were "unfounded" at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/early-probe-cleared-michael-jackson |title=Michael Jackson Bombshell |publisher=The Smoking Gun. December 9, 2003|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}</ref> After the young boy involved in the documentary and his mother later told investigators that Jackson had been improper with the boy, Jackson was arrested in November 2003, and was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#United States of America|administering an intoxicating agent]] in relation to the 13-year-old boy shown in the film.<ref name = "tara 640"/> Jackson denied the allegations, saying the sleepovers were not sexual in nature. The \'\'[[People v. Jackson]]\'\' trial began on January 31, 2005, in [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], California, and lasted five months, until the end of May. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.<ref name="taraborrelli20"/><ref name="Michael Jackson health concerns"/><ref name="Michael Jackson jury reaches verdict"/> After the trial, in a highly publicized relocation he moved to the Persian Gulf island of [[Bahrain]], as a guest of [[Abdullah Bin Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa|Sheikh Abdullah]].<ref name="Jackson settles down to his new life in the Persian Gulf"/> Bahrain was also where the family intended to send Jackson if he was convicted (though Jackson did not know about the plan), according to a statement by Jermaine Jackson printed in \'\'[[The Times]]\'\' of London in September 2011.<ref name="Jermaine Jackson reveals escape plan for Michael"/>

===2006\xe2\x80\x9309: Closure of Neverland, final years, and \'\'This Is It\'\'===
[[File:Michael Jackson 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Jackson and his son Blanket in [[Disneyland Paris]], 2006]]
In March 2006, the main house at the Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure.<ref name="Jackson Closes Neverland House"/> There were numerous reports around that time that Jackson was having financial problems. Jackson had been delinquent on his repayments of a $270&nbsp;million loan secured against his music publishing holdings, even though those holdings were reportedly making him as much as {{Nowrap|$75 million}} a year.<ref name="Really Odd Facts About Michael Jackson"/> [[Bank of America]] sold the debt to [[Fortress Investment Group|Fortress Investments]]. Sony reportedly proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson\'s stake in their jointly owned publishing company (leaving Jackson with a 25% stake).<ref name="sonydeal"/> Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal in April 2006, although the exact details were not made public.<ref name="Jackson strikes deal over loans"/> Jackson did not have a recording contract in place with Sony or any other major record label at the time.

In early 2006, there was an announcement that Jackson had signed a contract with a [[Bahrain]]-based startup called Two Seas Records. However, nothing ever came of that deal, and the CEO of Two Seas, [[Gut Records|Guy Holmes]], later stated that the deal had never been finalized.<ref name="2seas-billboard"/><ref name="2seas-bbc"/> Throughout 2006, Sony repackaged 20 singles from the 1980s and 1990s as the \'\'[[Visionary: The Video Singles|Michael Jackson: Visionary]]\'\' series, which subsequently became a [[box set]]. Most of those singles returned to the charts as a result. In September 2006, Jackson and his ex-wife Debbie Rowe confirmed reports that they had settled their long-running child custody suit. The terms were never made public. Jackson continued to be the custodial parent of the couple\'s two children.<ref name="Jackson settles with Ex wife"/> In October 2006, [[Fox News]] entertainment reporter Roger Friedman said that Jackson had been recording at a studio in rural [[County Westmeath|Westmeath, Ireland]]. It was not known at the time what Jackson might be working on, or who might be paying for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas.<ref name="2seas-bbc" /><ref name="Who\'s Funding Jackson\'s Retreat to Irish Recording Studio?"/>

In November 2006, Jackson invited an \'\'[[Access Hollywood]]\'\' camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and [[MSNBC]] broke the story that he was working on a new album, produced by [[will.i.am]] of [[The Black Eyed Peas]].<ref name="KOP achievements"/> Jackson performed at the [[2006 World Music Awards|World Music Awards]], in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over {{Nowrap|100 million}} records.<ref name="KOP achievements"/><ref name="2006 World Music Awards"/> Jackson returned to the United States after Christmas 2006 to attend [[James Brown]]\'s funeral in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], Georgia. He gave one of the eulogies, saying that "James Brown is my greatest inspiration."<ref name="jb"/> In the spring of 2007, Jackson and Sony teamed up to buy yet another music publishing company: [[Famous Music|Famous Music LLC]], formerly owned by [[Viacom]]. This deal gave him the rights to songs by [[Eminem]], [[Shakira]] and [[Beck]], among others.<ref name="2007 music deal"/> Jackson recorded extensively during this period in New York with songwriter and producer will.i.am and also in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] with producers [[Akon]] and [[RedOne]].<ref name="telegraph-june09"/><ref name="hitquarters.com"/> In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the [[Associated Press]] in Tokyo, where he said, "I\'ve been in the entertainment industry since I was 6 years old, and as [[Charles Dickens]] would say, \'It\'s been the best of times, the worst of times.\' But I would not change my career..... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me."<ref name="usatoday"/>

In March 2007, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan named [[Camp Zama]] to greet 3,000 plus U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation for his devotion to U.S. Military troops and their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oE9ASCivi70J:www.examiner.com/article/michael-jackson-was-long-time-u-s-military-supporter&hl=en&gl=uk&strip=1|last=Halaby|first=Valerie|title=Michael Jackson was long-time U.S. Military supporter|publisher=Clarity Digital Group LLC|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref>

In September 2007, Jackson was reportedly still working with will.i.am, but the album was apparently never completed.<ref name="Will.i.am On Working With Michael Jackson"/> However, in 2008, Jackson and Sony released \'\'[[Thriller 25]]\'\' to mark the 25th anniversary of the original \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\'. This album featured the previously unreleased song "For All Time" (an outtake from the original sessions) as well as remixes, where Jackson collaborated with younger artists who had been inspired by his work.<ref name="National certifications for Thriller 25"/> Two of the remixes were released as singles with only modest success: "[[The Girl Is Mine 2008]]" (with [[will.i.am]]) and "[[Wanna Be Startin\' Somethin\' 2008]]" (with [[Akon]]). The first single was based on an early demo version, without [[Paul McCartney]]. The album itself was a hit, however.<ref name="National certifications for Thriller 25" /><ref name="Thriller 25 chart positions at digitalproducer"/><ref name="Thriller 25 chart positions"/><ref name="Worldwide shipments of T25"/> In anticipation of Jackson\'s 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest-hits albums called \'\'[[King of Pop (album)|King of Pop]]\'\'.

[[File:NeverlandRides.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of part of Jackson\'s {{convert|2800|acre|km2|adj=on}} Neverland Valley Ranch near Los Olivos, CA showing the many rides]]In late 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on [[Neverland Ranch]], which Jackson used as collateral for loans running into many tens of millions of dollars. However, Fortress opted to sell Jackson\'s debts to [[Colony Capital|Colony Capital LLC]]. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch\'s title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, which was a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. This deal cleared Jackson\'s debt, and he reportedly even gained an extra {{Nowrap|$35 million}} from the venture. At the time of his death, Jackson still owned a stake in Neverland/Sycamore Valley, but it was not announced how large that stake was.<ref name="Neverland peters out for pop\'s Peter Pan"/><ref name="association"/><ref name="Ten Most Expensive Michael Jackson Collectibles"/> In September 2008, Jackson entered negotiations with [[Julien\'s Auctions|Julien\'s Auction House]] to display and auction a large collection of memorabilia amounting to approximately 1,390 lots. The auction was scheduled to take place between April 22 and 25.<ref name="Michael Jackson Exhibition \xe2\x80\x93 2009" /> An exhibition of the lots opened as scheduled on April 14, but the actual auction was eventually cancelled at Jackson\'s request.<ref name="Michael Jackson: The fantastic possessions revealed \xe2\x80\x93 Americas, World" />

In March 2009, Jackson held a press conference at London\'s [[The O2 Arena (London)|O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] and announced a series of comeback concerts titled [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]. The shows would be Jackson\'s first major series of concerts since the HIStory World Tour finished in 1997. Jackson suggested possible retirement after the shows; he said it would be his "final curtain call". The initial plan was for 10 concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and [[Mumbai]]. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of AEG Live, stated that the first 10 dates alone would earn the singer approximately \xc2\xa350 million.<ref name="Michael Jackson grand finale curtain-raiser"/> The London residency was increased to 50 dates after record breaking ticket sales: over one million were sold in less than two hours.<ref name="Rolling Stone 50 dates 1 million tickets">{{Cite news|first=Daniel |last=Kreps |title=Michael Jackson\'s "This Is It!"

Most of these rehearsals took place at the [[Staples Center]], which was owned by AEG.<ref name="Michael Jackson: The Last Rehearsal"/> The concerts would have commenced on July 13, 2009, and finished on March 6, 2010. Less than three weeks before the first show was due to begin in London and with all concerts being sold out, Jackson died after suffering cardiac arrest.<ref name="Michael Jackson dead at 50 after cardiac arrest"/> Some time before his death, it was reported that he was starting a clothing line with [[Christian Audigier]].<ref name="Christian Audigier Michael Jackson Clothing Collection Confirmed"/><ref name="Michael Jackson Christian Audigier Clothing Line Was in the Works"/>

Jackson\'s first posthumous song released entirely by his Estate was titled "[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]" which Jackson cowrote in the 1980s with [[Paul Anka]]. It was not on the set lists for the concerts, and the recording was based on an old demo tape. The surviving brothers reunited in the studio for the first time since 1989 to record backing vocals. On October 28, 2009, a documentary film about the rehearsals titled \'\'[[Michael Jackson\'s This Is It]]\'\' was released.<ref name="Judge Approves Michael Jackson Film"/> Even though it ran for a limited two-week engagement, it became the highest grossing documentary or concert movie of all time, with earnings of more than {{Nowrap|$260 million}} worldwide.<ref name="boxofficemojo"/> Jackson\'s estate received 90% of the profits.<ref name="Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal"/> The film was accompanied by a [[Michael Jackson\'s This Is It (album)|compilation album of the same name]]. Two versions of the new song appear on the album, which also featured original masters of Jackson\'s hits in the order in which they appear in the movie, along with a bonus disc with previously unreleased versions of more Jackson hits as well as a spoken-word poem titled "Planet Earth".<ref name="New Michael Jackson Song, Album Due In October"/> At the [[American Music Awards of 2009|2009 American Music Awards]], Jackson won four posthumous awards, two for him and two for his album \'\'Number Ones\'\', bringing his total American Music Awards to 26.<ref name="AMAs MJ"/><ref name="AMAs 2009"/>

Jackson\'s music took root in [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]]. He had been influenced by the work of musicians such as [[Little Richard]], [[James Brown]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Fred Astaire]],<ref name=samandfred>{{cite news |last=Tucker |first=Ken |title=SUMMER READING; FIRING YOUR FATHER ISN\'T EASY |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/05/books/summer-reading-firing-your-father-isn-t-easy.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 5, 1988 |page=2 |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69SHJVwfM |archivedate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]],<ref name=samandfred/> [[Gene Kelly]],<ref name=slateinfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/08/23/gene_kelly_turns_100_the_dancer_s_legacy_persists_in_popular_dance_.html|title=Why People Still Dance Like Gene Kelly|work=Slate|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> [[David Ruffin]],<ref name=rollingstonedavid>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-20101202|title=100 Greatest Singers: David Ruffin|work=Rolling Stone|year=2008|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref> [[The Isley Brothers]], the [[Bee Gees]], and the [[West Side Story]] dancers, to whom he made a tribute in "[[Beat It]]" and in the "Bad" video.<ref name="Jones2005"/> According to [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]], who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 [[Diana Ross]] TV special \'\'[[Diana!]]\'\', Jackson watched [[West Side Story]] almost every week and it was his favorite film.<ref name="Magickpapers.com"/><ref name="Thank you BigBearJohn: here\'s also David Winters"/><ref name="Remembering Michael Jackson, On Screen"/> While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,<ref name="Michael Jackson saved my life"/> James Brown was Jackson\'s greatest inspiration. In reference to Brown, Jackson declared: "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown."<ref name="James Brown \xe2\x80\x93 Jackson Attends Brown\'s Public Funeral \xe2\x80\x93 Contactmusic News" />

The young Michael Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He later expressed: "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang&nbsp; \xe2\x80\x93 just the way she was." He told her: "I want to be just like you, Diana." She said: "You just be yourself."<ref name="taraborrelli23"/> But Jackson owed part of his enduring style\xe2\x80\x94especially his use of the \'\'oooh\'\' interjection\xe2\x80\x94to Ross. From a young age, Jackson often punctuated his verses with a sudden exclamation of \'\'oooh\'\'. Diana Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with [[The Supremes]].<ref name="taraborrelli24"/>

===Musical themes and genres===
Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper. Instead he would dictate into a sound recorder, and when recording he would sing the lyrics from memory.<ref name="taraborrelli25"/> In most of his songs, such as "[[Billie Jean]]", "[[Who Is It (Michael Jackson song)|Who Is It]]", and "[[Tabloid Junkie]]", he would beatbox and imitate the instruments using his voice instead of playing the actual instruments, along with other sounds. Jackson noted that it is easier to sing a drum line, or sing a bass, instead of playing a drum line or a bass with an instrument. Several critics have said that Jackson\'s distinct voice was able to replace any instrument convincingly. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] said that, throughout his solo career, Jackson\'s versatility allowed him to experiment with various themes and genres.<ref name=allmusic/> As a musician, he ranged from Motown\'s dance fare and ballads to [[techno]] and [[house music|house]]-edged [[new jack swing]] to work that incorporates both [[funk]] rhythms and [[hard rock]] guitar.<ref name="rollingstone"/><ref name=Help/><ref name="AMG Thriller"/>

In \'\'Bad\'\', Jackson\'s concept of the predatory lover can be seen on the rock song "[[Dirty Diana]]".<ref name="NYT Bad"/> The lead single "[[I Just Can\'t Stop Loving You]]" is a traditional love ballad, while "[[Man in the Mirror]]" is an anthemic ballad of confession and resolution. "[[Smooth Criminal]]" was an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.<ref name="TIME2"/> Allmusic\'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] states that \'\'Dangerous\'\' presents Jackson as a very paradoxical individual.<ref name="ALG Dangerous"/> He comments the album is more diverse than his previous \'\'Bad\'\', as it appeals to an urban audience while also attracting the middle class with anthems like "[[Heal the World]]".<ref name="ALG Dangerous"/> The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]" and "[[Remember the Time]]".<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> The album is Jackson\'s first where social ills become a primary theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests against world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> \'\'Dangerous\'\' contains sexually charged efforts such as the multifaceted love song, "[[In the Closet]]".<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "[[Will You Be There]]", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith"; these songs show Jackson opening up about various personal struggles and worries.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> In the ballad "[[Gone Too Soon]]", Jackson gives tribute to his friend [[Ryan White]] and the plight of those with AIDS.<ref name="TWP Dangerous"/>

\'\'HIStory\'\' creates an atmosphere of paranoia.<ref name="ALG HIStory"/> Its content focuses on the hardships and public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production. In the new jack swing-funk-rock efforts "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]" and "Tabloid Junkie", along with the R&B ballad "[[You Are Not Alone]]", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs much of his anger at the media.<ref name="RS HIStory"/> In the introspective ballad "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", Jackson laments over his "fall from grace", while songs like "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Scream/Childhood|Childhood]]", "Little Susie" and "Smile" are all operatic pop pieces.<ref name="ALG HIStory"/><ref name="RS HIStory"/> In the track "[[D.S. (song)|D.S.]]", Jackson launched a verbal attack against [[Thomas W. Sneddon, Jr.|Tom Sneddon]]. He describes Sneddon as an antisocial, white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive". Of the song, Sneddon said, "I have not\xe2\x80\x94shall we say\xe2\x80\x94done him the honor of listening to it, but I\'ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot".<ref name="Sneddon profile"/> \'\'Invincible\'\' found Jackson working heavily with producer Rodney Jerkins.<ref name="allmusic"/> It is a record made up of urban soul like "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as "[[Speechless (Michael Jackson song)|Speechless]]", "Break of Dawn", and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]" and mixes [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], pop, and [[R&B]] in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and "Invincible".<ref name="ALG Invincible"/><ref name="NME Invincible"/>

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed noticeably. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson\'s voice descended from boy soprano to high tenor.<ref name="brac 414"/> His vocal range as an adult was F2-E\xe2\x99\xad6. Jackson first used a technique called the "[[vocal hiccup]]" in 1973, starting with the song "It\'s Too Late to Change the Time" from [[The Jackson 5]]\'s \'\'[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]\'\' album.<ref name="brown"/> Jackson did not use the hiccup technique\xe2\x80\x94somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping\xe2\x80\x94fully until the recording of \'\'[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]\'\': it can be seen in full force in the "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]" promotional video.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 22"/> With the arrival of \'\'Off the Wall\'\' in the late 1970s, Jackson\'s abilities as a vocalist were well regarded. At the time, \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder. Their analysis was also that "Jackson\'s feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that\'s used very daringly".<ref name="AMG OTW"/><ref name="RS OTW"/> 1982 saw the release of \'\'Thriller\'\', and \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' was of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".<ref name="RS Thriller"/>

A distinctive deliberate mispronunciation of "come on", used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled "c\'mon", "cha\'mone", or "shamone", is also a staple in impressions and caricatures of him.<ref name="Pink Grease"/> The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album \'\'Dangerous\'\'. \'\'The New York Times\'\' noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone".<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.<ref name="NYT Dangerous"/> When commenting on \'\'Invincible\'\', \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' were of the opinion that\xe2\x80\x94at the age of 43\xe2\x80\x94Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".<ref name="RS Invincible"/> Nelson George summed up Jackson\'s vocals by stating "The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness\xe2\x80\x94that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist".<ref name="Nelson George overview 24"/>

Very concerned about a transparent rendition of this identity, the sound engineer [[Bruce Swedien]] opted for some technical approaches and studio strategies aiming at keeping as truly as possible the singer\xe2\x80\x99s intimate and natural expressions: mikes, analogic recordings, special techniques elaborated to design vocal prisms, creation of natural acoustic spaces, conversion of stereophonic fields in tri-dimensional sound spaces playing with early reflections, plywood, Monstercable or Tubetraps.<ref>Isabelle Stegner-Petitjean, "[http://www.cairn.info/revue-volume-2011-2-page-222.htm \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice in the Mirror\xe2\x80\x9d.

===Music videos and choreography===
Jackson has also been referred to as the King of Music Videos.<ref name="collecters"/> Steve Huey of Allmusic observed how Jackson transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances, simultaneously breaking down racial barriers.<ref name="allmusic" /> Before \'\'Thriller\'\', Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American.<ref name="blender"/> Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", leading to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, also helping other black music artists gain recognition.<ref name="Jackson changes the rules of the music video"/> MTV employees deny any racism in their coverage, or pressure to change their stance. MTV maintains that they played rock music, regardless of race.<ref name="Jet MTV"/> The popularity of his videos on MTV helped to put the relatively young channel "on the map"; MTV\'s focus shifted in favor of pop and R&B.<ref name="Jackson changes the rules of the music video"/><ref name="ABCNews"/> His performance on \'\'Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\'\' changed the scope of live stage show; "That Jackson lip-synced \'Billie Jean\' is, in itself, not extraordinary, but the fact that it did not change the impact of the performance is extraordinary; whether the performance was live or lip-synced made no difference to the audience" thus creating an era in which artists re-create the spectacle of music video imagery on stage.<ref name="MT25"/> Short films like \'\'[[Michael Jackson\'s Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\'\' largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in "Beat It" has frequently been imitated.<ref name="The Thriller Special Edition Audio"/> The choreography in \'\'Thriller\'\' has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from [[Cinema of India|Indian films]] to [[Thriller (viral video)|prisons in the Philippines]].<ref name="Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller"/> The \'\'Thriller\'\' short film marked an increase in scale for music videos, and has been named the most successful music video ever by the \'\'Guinness World Records\'\'.<ref name="World Records"/>

In the 19-minute music video for "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]"\xe2\x80\x94directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]\xe2\x80\x94Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not previously seen in his work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, "I think it happens subliminally" and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. "Bad" garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; \'\'Time\'\' magazine described it as "infamous". The video also featured [[Wesley Snipes]]; in the future Jackson\'s videos would often feature famous cameo roles.<ref name="tara 370\xe2\x80\x93373"/><ref name="Who\'s Bad? TIME"/> For the "[[Smooth Criminal]]" video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer\'s center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer\'s feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted {{US patent|src=uspto|5255452}} for the device.<ref name="tompkins"/> Although the music video for "[[Leave Me Alone]]" was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three \'\'Billboard\'\' Music Video Awards;<ref>Campbell, Lisa D. \'\'Michael Jackson: The King of Pop\'\', p. 273.</ref> the same year it won a Golden Lion Award for the quality of the special effects used in its production.

He received the [[MTV Video Vanguard Award]] in 1988 and the MTV Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award in 1990 to celebrate his accomplishments in the art form in the 1980s; in 1991 the first award was renamed in his honor.<ref name="Nelson George overview 45-46"/> "[[Black or White]]" was accompanied by a controversial music video, which, on November 14, 1991, simultaneously premiered in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest viewing ever for a music video at that time.<ref name="KOP achievements"/> It featured scenes construed as having a sexual nature as well as depictions of violence. The offending scenes in the final half of the 14-minute version were edited out to prevent the video from being banned, and Jackson apologized.<ref name="\'\'Dangerous\'\' on Film"/> Along with Jackson, it featured [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Peggy Lipton]], and [[George Wendt]]. It helped usher in [[morphing]] as an important technology in music videos.<ref name="campbell26"/>

"[[Remember the Time]]" was an elaborate production, and became one of his longest videos at over nine minutes. Set in [[ancient Egypt]], it featured groundbreaking [[visual effects]] and appearances by [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Iman (model)|Iman]], and [[Magic Johnson]], along with a distinct complex dance routine.<ref name="campbell27"/> The video for "[[In the Closet]]" was Jackson\'s most sexually provocative piece. It featured supermodel [[Naomi Campbell]] in a courtship dance with Jackson. The video was banned in South Africa because of its imagery.<ref name = "Nelson George overview 45-46"/>

The music video for "[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]", directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and production designer Tom Foden, is one of Jackson\'s most critically acclaimed. In 1995, it gained 11 [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award Nominations]]\xe2\x80\x94more than any other music video\xe2\x80\x94and won "Best Dance Video", "Best Choreography", and "Best Art Direction".<ref name="TCI"/> The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media after being accused of child molestation in 1993.<ref name="Michael Jackson Interview Raises Questions, Answers"/> A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form; shortly afterwards \'\'Guinness World Records\'\' listed it as the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music video ever made]] at a cost of $7 million.<ref name = "Ultimate booklet 48\xe2\x80\x9350"/><ref name="Guinness World Records 2006"/>

The media has commonly referred to Jackson as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Pop]]" because, throughout his career, he transformed the art of music videos and paved the way for modern pop music. \'\'[[The Daily Telegraph]]\'\' writer [[Tom Utley]] described Jackson in 2003 as "extremely important" and a "genius".<ref name="telegraph1"/> For much of his career, he had an "unparalleled" level of worldwide influence over the younger generation through his musical and humanitarian contributions.<ref name="ADL"/> Jackson\'s music and videos, such as \'\'Thriller\'\', [[MTV#Breaking the color barrier|fostered racial diversity]] in MTV\'s roster, helped to put the relatively new channel into public awareness, and steered the channel\'s focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. Jackson\'s work continues to influence numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]], rock, pop and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] artists. BET described Jackson "as quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time" and someone who "revolutionized the music video and brought dances like the moonwalk to the world.

Allmusic\'s Steve Huey describes Jackson as "an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power".<ref name=allmusic /> In the mid-1980s, \'\'Time\'\' magazine\'s pop music critic, [[Jay Cocks]], noted "Jackson is the biggest thing since [[The Beatles]].

==Earnings and wealth==
It is estimated that Michael Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-27/news-interviews/28175740_1_stress-michael-jackson-demerol |title=Stress killed MJ, says ex-publicist |work=The Times of India |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=March 16, 2013}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Sales of his recordings through Sony\'s music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have also earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog) endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.<ref name="LeedsSorkin">{{cite news|first=Timothy L|last=O\'Brien|title=What Happened to the Fortune Michael Jackson Made?|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=May 14, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/business/yourmoney/14michael.html|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

===U.S. Federal estate tax problems===

On July 26, 2013, the executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson filed a petition in the [[United States Tax Court]] as a result of a dispute with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) over [[Estate tax in the United States|U.S. federal estate taxes]] imposed on the value of Jackson\'s Estate at the time of his death.

==History==

===1992\xe2\x80\x9397: Formation, signing with Sony Music, first three albums and international breakthrough===
The band name is a mix of "[[jam session]]" and "iroquai", based on the [[Iroquois]], a Native American tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252859-bio--Jamiroquai |title=Jamiroquai Biography on Yahoo! Music |accessdate=4 October 2007 |first=Greg |last=Prato|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> The original band was [[Jason Kay|Jay Kay]] (vocals), [[Toby Smith]] ([[Synthesizer|keyboard]]), [[Stuart Zender]] (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums), Wallis Buchanan ([[didgeridoo]]) and Alec Moran (pipeau). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and production of the first album. The line-up of the band has changed several times, and the longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter [[Jason Kay|Jason "Jay" Kay]], percussionist Sola Akingbola (since 1994), and drummer Derrick McKenzie (since 1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation of Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer of the [[Brand New Heavies]]. Although he has said that he has attempted to have Jamiroquai treated as a band, Kay has always been at the forefront.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Jamiroquai\'s first single, "[[When You Gonna Learn]]", was released in 1992 on the [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz label]].  Following its success, Kay signed an eight-album record deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. The first Sony album, \'\'[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]\'\' was released in 1993. It was followed in 1994 by \'\'[[The Return of the Space Cowboy]]\'\'. The single "[[Space Cowboy (song)|Space Cowboy]]" gained notice on the charts and in club rotation.

While Jamiroquai were growing in popularity in the UK, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, they remained relatively unknown to U.S and other international audiences. The band\'s American breakthrough came with the third album, \'\'[[Travelling Without Moving]]\'\' in 1996, which yielded two big hits, "[[Virtual Insanity]]" and "[[Cosmic Girl]]". The success of "Virtual Insanity" was due in part to its [[Jonathan Glazer]]-directed video, which featured Kay\'s dance moves and some physics-defying images.  At the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], the creative [[Virtual Insanity (music video)|music video for "Virtual Insanity"]] won four awards; [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Best Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[MTV Video Music Award - Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]], and the band performed the song at the ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1997/|title=1997 MTV Video Music Awards|publisher=Mtv.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>

===1998\xe2\x80\x932003: \'\'Synkronized\'\', \'\'A Funk Odyssey\'\' and changes to style and line-up===
In 1998, Jamiroquai released "[[Deeper Underground]]", the first single from their fourth studio album, \'\'[[Synkronized]]\'\', which also appeared in the soundtrack for the 1998 movie \'\'[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]\'\'. The acid jazz flavours and ethnic influences of the first three albums continued with the release of \'\'Synkronized\'\', and Jay Kay\'s interest in [[funk]] and [[disco]] music were shifting the band\'s directions towards such. By their fifth album, \'\'[[A Funk Odyssey]]\'\' (2001), they had evolved so drastically, that some critics and listeners would remark they lost the \'Jamiroquai sound\'. With the departure of more and more original band members, including Wallis Buchanan and his [[didgeridoo]], Jamiroquai had become a very different band from that of 1992. In spite of the changes, the fifth album\'s first single, "[[Little L]]", reached No. 1 in many charts worldwide becoming their best dance hit.

In 2003, Jamiroquai compiled and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] a [[DJ mix|DJ mix album]] for the [[Late Night Tales]] series for [[Azuli Records]]. The track selection shows some of the band\'s [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] influences, including tracks from [[Pointer Sisters|The Pointer Sisters]], [[Commodores|The Commodores]], [[Johnny "Hammond" Smith]] and [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]].

===2004\xe2\x80\x9306: \'\'Dynamite\'\', \'\'High Times: Singles 1992\xe2\x80\x932006\'\' and end of contract with Sony Music===

[[File:JamqMagic.JPG|righ|thumb|444px|Jamiroquai appearing at the Magic Summer Live in July 2013.]]
Their sixth album, titled \'\'[[Dynamite (Jamiroquai album)|Dynamite]]\'\' was released on 20 June 2005. It reached No. 3 on the UK charts. The first single, "Feels Just Like It Should" was released early in June, the second, "[[Seven Days in Sunny June]]" released on 15 August 2005, followed by the third, "[[(Don\'t) Give Hate A Chance]]" on 7 November 2005.

Jamiroquai released a greatest hits collection, \'\'[[High Times: Singles 1992-2006]]\'\' in November 2006. The release of this album marked the end of Kay\'s eight-album contract with [[Sony Music|Sony]].  The album reached the number 1 spot in the UK album chart after its first week of release. The album featured two new tracks, "Runaway" and "Radio". On 18 September 2006, "Runaway" was given its first play by UK radio stations. It was released as a single on 30 October 2006.   Kay remarked that compilation was released purely out of contractual obligation: "2006, they\'re out of the picture."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/mad-hatter/2005/11/24/1132703291988.html | title=Mad hatter | date=25 November 2005 | accessdate=29 November 2005 | work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

Jamiroquai have had 13 nominations for The Brit Awards, and have yet to win one.

In March 2006, Jamiroquai announced their switch to [[Columbia Records]]. Future releases will appear under the Columbia imprint.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070301201754re_/www.jamiroquai.com/default.aspx?url=/news/detail.aspx?Parent%3dNews%26id%3d106 | title=Jamiroquai Switch to Columbia Records | date=17 March 2006 | accessdate=31 August 2006 | publisher=Official Jamiroquai website (archived) }}</ref>

In October 2006, Jamiroquai recorded a live session for \'\'[[Live from Abbey Road]]\'\' at [[Abbey Road Studios]].  Their performance was shown alongside those of [[Damien Rice]] and the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] on the UK\'s Channel 4 in January 2007.

During February in 2007 Jamiroquai performed the record breaking [[Gig in the Sky]] in association with Sony Ericsson.

After leaving Sony, the band began to work on their seventh project, and several collaborations and side-projects. In a very short mid-2007 interview with Jamirotalk, drummer Derick McKenzie expressed his satisfaction with leaving Sony as the beginning of a period in which the band will have more creative control over their own work, together with plenty of room for experimentation and lack of pressure from a record company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamirotalk.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7129 |title=International Jamiroquai Fan Discussion Forum |publisher=Jamirotalk |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref>

===2008\xe2\x80\x9312: \'\'Rock Dust Light Star\'\'===
In January 2008, the band confirmed that the recording process for their latest album had begun. According to the news item, eleven tracks had already been written for the new album, with more to come. The first known track for the 7th album, named "Rock Dust Light Star", was performed live and confirmed by Kay himself to be on the new album.<ref>[http://www.jamiroquai.com/site/news/217/jamiroquai-play-warm-up-show-at-the-debut-club# Jamiroquai Play Warm-up Show At The Debut Club]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

On 28 February 2008, Jamiroquai performed at the Khodynka Arena in Moscow, Russia at the launch of the new Audi A4 car. Jamiroquai performed at the Wianki Festival in Krak\xc3\xb3w, Poland on 22 June and at the Rock in Rio Madrid festival on 4 July 2008. On 5 April 2009, the band performed at the closing concert of Malaysian F1 Grand Prix in Sepang International Circuit Malaysia. On 9 April Jamiroquai played at the Sentul International Convention Centre in Jakarta, Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkin.com/news/?id=3851 |title=Jamiroquai \xe2\x80\x93 The Funkin Site |publisher=Funkin.com |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref>

In August 2009, Derrick McKenzie stated that Jamiroquai had then signed with [[Universal Records]] (UK) and had recorded more than 40 new tracks.  Also the new album will be recorded live and have a style similar to the first three albums with the use of strings and horns, with less of a "disco sound" but will be a lot more funky and soulful. Based on official mailing list e-mails (related to jamiroquai.com and Jamiroquai\'s record label) promoting a contest, Jamiroquai are now signed to Mercury Records/Universal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkin.com/news/3944 |title=Jamiroquai \xe2\x80\x93 The Funkin Site |publisher=Funkin.com |date=21 May 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref>

On 1 September 2010, Jay Kay featured on [[The Chris Moyles Show]] (This edition hosted by [[Vernon Kay]]) and the single "[[White Knuckle Ride]]" was played for the first time, live on air. On 1 October 2010, Jamiroquai appeared on UK television\'s \'\'Later...with Jools Holland\'\'. "Rock Dust Light Star" was the first performance of the show; they also performed "Deeper Underground" and "Blue Skies".

On 1 November 2010, they released as announced their long anticipated seventh album, \'\'[[Rock Dust Light Star]]\'\'. Recorded in Jay Kay\'s home studio in Buckinghamshire, it saw a return to their earlier, less pop-like sound. Despite both singles, "Blue Skies" and "White Knuckle Ride" reaching into Top 100 charts worldwide, the album sold a mere 34,378 copies on its debut, around half the number of the previous album, \'\'Dynamite\'\'. On 9 June 2011, the band released a new track called "Smile" for free download on their Soundcloud site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/jamiroquai1/jamiroquai-smile |title=Official Jamiroquai Soundcloud Page |publisher=Soundcloud.com |accessdate=13 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> The band ran a competition to choose the artwork for the cover, Jay picked the winning design which was by Australian designer Zbigniew Klej. On 21 April 2012, \'\'Rock Dust Light Star\'\', was released State-side after a 2-year delay, in a double vinyl LP/CD bundle.  A CD version of the album was also given a wider release on 24 April 2012.

===2012\xe2\x80\x93present: 20th anniversary reissues and beyond===
On 21 August 2012, Sony Music Japan announced that, for the 20th anniversary of Jamiroquai in 2013, they would remaster and reissue their first three studio albums &ndash; \'\'Emergency on Planet Earth\'\' (1993), \'\'The Return of the Space Cowboy\'\' (1994) and \'\'Travelling Without Moving\'\' (1996) &ndash; with a bonus CD with all the \'B-Side material, live material & rarities\' of each album era of the band. Sony Japan appears to have abandoned the idea. Sony Music Europe took over the \'remastered reissues\' project for the 20th anniversary of Jamiroquai in Ireland/UK, and set March 2013 release dates. Online boutiques in the US started selling on 19 March 2013. Vinyl double gatefold deluxe vinyl albums with bonus tracks were released on 25 March 2013 in the UK and on 26 March 2013 in the US.

In August 2013, McKenzie confirmed the band would start work on their eighth studio album in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBYryxo5gAw&list=PL765C411C413E0C60&feature=player_detailpage&t=714 |title=Derrick McKenzie (Jamiroquai) \xe2\x80\x93 Interview with Spike [PART ONE] |publisher=YouTube |date=7 August 2013 |accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> A 2015 release date is expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkin.com/news/4188 |title=Jamiroquai &#124; New jamiroquai album and website in the planning... \xe2\x80\x93 10 December 2012, 12:02 (GMT) |publisher=Funkin.com |date=10 December 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamiroquai.com/news;news/10403/Jamiroquai-20-years- |title=Jamiroquai Official Website / News |publisher=Jamiroquai.com |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>

==Buffalo Man==
[[File:Buffalomanoriginal.jpg|thumb|right|The original Buffalo Man slightly modified since 1997.]]

"Buffalo Man" is the name of the silhouette character featured on most of the covers of Jamiroquai\'s releases. The image was created sometime prior to the release of their 1992 single \'\'When You Gonna Learn\'\'. Allegedly it was originally sketched by the front-man [[Jay Kay]], as \'\'Buffalo Man\'\' is seemingly a [[self portrait]] [[silhouette]] of Kay wearing a [[American Bison|buffalo]] hat. It is based on the Minotaur from the Greek fable \'Theseus and the Minotaur\'. Jay Kay stated "I really identify with Theseus. In fact, I\'d say I am the most similar person to Theseus to come out of Stretford in the past 50 years." The mark has been used on almost every commercial (and sometimes non-commercial) release of the band\'s output in some form or another; usually the unique symbol is pictured unaltered, but there have been times where it is shown in a stylised manner to suit the artwork or song.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[File:JamBuff.jpg|thumb|right|The animated Buffalo Man as he appears in the "[[(Don\'t) Give Hate a Chance]]" music video.]]

Over the years, Buffalo Man has seen some temporary changes or interesting thematic uses:

"Half the Man", \'\'[[The Return of the Space Cowboy]]\'\'
For the single "Half The Man", \'\'Buffalo Man\'\' is on the cover as a keyring with a heart in the clasp representing the fact it is a love song and the keyring itself is split down the middle in two-halves to represent the song title.  \'\'Buffalo Man\'\' also has a silver heart.

"[[Space Cowboy (song)|Space Cowboy]]", \'\'[[The Return of the Space Cowboy]]\'\'
For the single "Space Cowboy", \'\'Buffalo Man\'\' is present on the cover as a shaped cigarette paper for a half-complete cannabis joint, in reference to the song\'s praise of the drug.

"[[Virtual Insanity]]", \'\'[[Travelling Without Moving]]\'\'
For the single of "Virtual Insanity", Buffalo Man appears in the place of the [[Ferrari]] horse in an homage to Jason\'s love of sports cars. For the album cover to \'\'Travelling Without Moving\'\', the artwork is similar, but takes on an embossed effect and is seen on a metal grille.

"[[Cosmic Girl]]", "Everyday"
For these two releases, Buffalo Man is pictured with a star over his heart and two intersecting orbital rings.

\'\'[[Synkronized]]\'\'
While the design remained fundamentally unaltered, Buffalo Man has been turned into a [[laser|laser-cut]] [[mirror]] and photographed from interesting angles by Midori Tsukagoshi. On some editions, for the disc itself, no ink has been used on the character, but the same stone background found on the front cover has been used for the rest of the disc, thus allowing the consumer to recreate the photographed effect.

\'\'[[A Funk Odyssey]]\'\'
For this album, the Buffalo Man was notably absent from the cover; instead, the laser lights formed an outline of the Buffalo Man logo, which could be seen much more clearly in the album\'s liner notes.

\'\'Dynamite\'\'
The US release and the double-disc Australian Tour Edition featured a gold Buffalo Man. Other releases saw a picture of Jay Kay instead.

\'\'[[Rock Dust Light Star]]\'\'
The letter "i" in the title is replaced with the Buffalo Man, making the first appearance in a Jamiroquai album cover since 1999\'s \'\'Synkronized\'\' (not counting the alternative artwork for \'\'Dynamite\'\'). The US cover for the album features a glossy yellow Buffalo Man standing upon a glowing floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rock-dust-light-star/id516385122 |title=iTunes \xe2\x80\x93 Music \xe2\x80\x93 Rock Dust Light Star by Jamiroquai |publisher=iTunes Store |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref> The vinyl release also features another cover including the Buffalo Man.

==Early life==
Stevie Wonder was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], Michigan, in 1950, the third of six children to Calvin Judkins and [[Lula Mae Hardaway]]. He was born six weeks premature, which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted in [[retinopathy of prematurity]] (ROP), a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes the [[retina]]s to detach; so he became blind.<ref name="incubator">{{cite news|title=Stevie Wonder: Blind faith|publisher=[[The Independent]]|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/stevie-wonder-blind-faith-865838.html|date=July 12, 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Larry King interview 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1011/30/lkl.01.html |title=Transcript of interview: Larry King and Stevie Wonder |date=November 30, 2010 |work=Larry King Live |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 4, 2011}}</ref> When Wonder was four, his mother left his father and moved to Detroit with her children. She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son\'s surname to Morris, partly because of relatives. Wonder has retained Morris as his legal surname. Wonder began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica and drums. He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners, and occasionally at parties and dances.<ref>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA312#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=312|title=Icons of R&B and Soul|author=Bob Gulla|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008}}</ref>

==Music career==

===Sixties singles: 1962\xe2\x80\x9369===
[[File:Stevie Wonder 1967 (1).jpg|thumb|left|Rehearsing for a performance on the Dutch [[TROS]] TV channel in 1967]]

In 1961, when aged 11, Wonder sang his own composition, "Lonely Boy", to [[Ronald White|Ronnie White]] of [[the Miracles]];<ref name="Werner, Craig 2004">{{cite book|author=Craig Werner|title= Higher Ground|publisher= Crown Publishers|year= 2004}}</ref><ref name=Icon313/> White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition at [[Motown]], where CEO [[Berry Gordy]] signed Wonder to Motown\'s Tamla label.<ref name="blindfaith"/> Before signing, producer [[Clarence Paul]] gave him the name \'\'\'Little Stevie Wonder\'\'\'.<ref name="incubator"/> Because of Wonder\'s age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21. He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 a week, and a private tutor was provided for when Wonder was on tour.<ref name=Icon313>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA313#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=313|title=Icons of R&B and Soul|author=Bob Gulla|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008}}</ref>

Wonder was put in the care of producer and songwriter Clarence Paul, and for a year they worked together on two albums. \'\'[[Tribute to Uncle Ray]]\'\' was recorded first, when Wonder was still 11 years old. Mainly covers of [[Ray Charles]]\'s songs, it included a Wonder and Paul composition, "Sunset". \'\'[[The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie]]\'\' was recorded next, an instrumental album consisting mainly of Paul\'s compositions, two of which, "Wondering" and "Session Number 112", were co-written with Wonder.<ref name=Icon314>{{cite book|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YNae0zmGow4C&pg=PA314#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=314|title=Icons of R&B and Soul|author=Bob Gulla|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2008}}</ref> Feeling Wonder was now ready, a song, "Mother Thank You", was recorded for release as a single, but then pulled and replaced by the Berry Gordy song "I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues" as his d\xc3\xa9but single;<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VXSaGI4-SZ8C&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=26|title=Stevie Wonder: Rhythms of Wonder|author=Sharon Davis|publisher=Robson|year= 2006}}</ref> released summer 1962,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8JRHnCMUVb8C&pg=PA194#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=194|title=Motown: The Golden Years|author= Bill Dahl|publisher=Krause Publications|date= February 28, 2011}}</ref> it almost broke into the \'\'Billboard\'\' 100, spending one week of August at 101 before dropping out of sight.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sophomore slumps|page=176|author=Christopher Golden|publisher=Carol Pub.

In 1968 he recorded an album of instrumental soul/jazz tracks, mostly harmonica solos, under the title \'\'[[Eivets Rednow]]\'\', which is "Stevie Wonder" spelled backwards.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HISHiLVxVnIC&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=13|title=The Sound of Stevie Wonder: His Words and Music|author= James E. Perone|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date= January 1, 2006}}</ref> The album failed to get much attention, and its only single, a cover of "Alfie", only reached number 66 on the U.S. Pop charts and number 11 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary charts. Nonetheless, he managed to score several hits between 1968 and 1970 such as "[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]";<ref name=pc50/> "[[For Once in My Life]]" and "[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I\'m Yours]]". A number of Wonder\'s early hits, including "[[My Cherie Amour (song)|My Cherie Amour]]", "I Was Made to Love Her", and "Uptight (Everything\'s Alright)", were co-written with [[Henry Cosby]].

===Seventies albums and classic period: 1970\xe2\x80\x9379===
In September 1970, at the age of 20, Wonder married [[Syreeta Wright]], a songwriter and former Motown secretary. Wright and Wonder worked together on the next album, \'\'[[Where I\'m Coming From]]\'\'; Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VXSaGI4-SZ8C&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=72|title=Stevie Wonder: Rhythms of Wonder|author= Sharon Davis|publisher=Robson|year= 2006}}</ref> They wanted to "touch on the social problems of the world", and for the lyrics "to mean something".<ref name=Davis/> The album was released at around the same time as Marvin Gaye\'s \'\'[[What\'s Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What\'s Going On]]\'\'. As both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared; in a contemporary review by [[Vince Aletti]] in \'\'Rolling Stone\'\', Gaye\'s album was seen as successful, while Wonder\'s album was seen as failing due to "self-indulgent and cluttered" production, "undistinguished" and "pretentious" lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/where-im-coming-from-19710805|title=review: Where I\'m Coming From and What\'s Going On |date=August 5, 1971|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|author=[[Vince Aletti]]}}</ref> Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, he allowed his Motown contract to expire.<ref name="Posner p254">Posner, Gerald, \'\'Motown: Music, Money, Sex and Power\'\', p. 254.</ref>

In 1970, Wonder co-wrote, and played numerous instruments on the hit "[[It\'s a Shame (The Spinners song)|It\'s a Shame]]" for fellow Motown act [[The Spinners (U.S. band)|the Spinners]]. His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Very Best of Spinners |others=The Spinners |year=1993 |author=Kevin Phinney |page=3 |type=CD booklet |publisher= Rhino Records}}</ref>

During this period, Wonder independently recorded two albums and signed a contract with [[Motown]] Records. The 120-page contract was a precedent at Motown and gave Wonder a much higher [[Music Royalties|royalty]] rate.<ref name="rshrr80"/> Wonder returned to Motown in March 1972 with \'\'[[Music of My Mind]]\'\'. Unlike most previous albums on Motown, which usually consisted of a collection of singles, [[B-side]]s and covers, \'\'Music of My Mind\'\' was a full-length artistic statement with songs flowing together thematically.<ref name="rshrr80"/> Wonder\'s lyrics dealt with social, political, and mystical themes as well as standard romantic ones, while musically Wonder began exploring overdubbing and recording most of the instrumental parts himself.<ref name="rshrr80"/> \'\'Music of My Mind\'\' marked the beginning of a long collaboration with [[Tonto\'s Expanding Head Band]] ([[Robert Margouleff]] and [[Malcolm Cecil]]).<ref>[http://www.tontosexpandingheadband.com/ Tonto\'s Expanding Head Band].

By 1975, in his 25th year, Wonder had won two consecutive [[Grammy Award]]s: in 1974 for \'\'Innervisions\'\' and in 1975 for \'\'Fulfillingness\' First Finale\'\'.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hq1f922xR3MC&pg=PT56#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=56|title=Awesome African-American Rock and Soul Musicians|author= David Aretha|publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc.|date= August 1, 2012}}</ref> In 1975, he played harmonica on two tracks on [[Billy Preston]]\'s album \'\'[[It\'s My Pleasure]]\'\'.

The double album-with-extra-[[Extended Play|EP]] \'\'[[Songs in the Key of Life]]\'\', was released in September 1976. Sprawling in style, unlimited in ambition, and sometimes lyrically difficult to fathom, the album was hard for some listeners to assimilate, yet is regarded by many as Wonder\'s crowning achievement and one of the most recognizable and accomplished albums in pop music history.<ref name="rshrr80"/><ref name="rsrg83"/><ref name="acc">{{cite web |url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A363.htm|title=Acclaimed Music \xe2\x80\x93 Songs in the Key of Life|publisher=Acclaimed Music|accessdate=November 11, 2007}}</ref> The album became the first by an American artist to debut straight at No. 1 in the \'\'[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]\'\' charts, where it stood for 14 non-consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zeth Lundy |title= 33{{frac|1|3}} Songs in the key of life|publisher=Continuum|year= 2007| ISBN= 0-8264-1926-7|page= 16}}</ref> Two tracks became No. 1 Pop/R&B hits "[[I Wish (Stevie Wonder song)|I Wish]]" and "[[Sir Duke]]".

===Commercial period: 1980\xe2\x80\x9390===
The 1980s saw Wonder achieving his biggest hits and highest level of fame; he had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations, political impact, and television appearances. The 1979 mainly instrumental soundtrack album \'\'[[Stevie Wonder\'s Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"]]\'\' was composed using an early music sampler, a [[Computer Music Melodian]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/28/whats-that-sound-sampler| author =David McNamee | date = September 28, 2009 | title =Hey, what\'s that sound: Sampler | work =[[The Guardian]] }}</ref> Wonder toured briefly in support of the album, and used a [[Fairlight CMI]] sampler on stage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andy Stewart|title=Name Behind the Name: Bruce Jackson \xe2\x80\x93 Apogee, Jands, Lake Technology |journal=Audio Technology |issue=40}}</ref> In this year Wonder also wrote and produced the dance hit "Let\'s Get Serious", performed by [[Jermaine Jackson]] and (ranked by \'\'Billboard\'\' as the No. 1 R&B single of 1980).

\'\'[[Hotter than July]]\'\' (1980) became Wonder\'s first platinum-selling single album, and its single "[[Happy Birthday (1980 song)|Happy Birthday]]" was a successful vehicle for his campaign to establish Dr. [[Martin Luther King]]\'s birthday as a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|national holiday]]. The album also included "[[Master Blaster (Jammin\')]]", "[[I Ain\'t Gonna Stand for It]]", and the sentimental ballad, "[[Lately (Stevie Wonder song)|Lately]]".

In 1982, Wonder released a retrospective of his 1970s work with \'\'[[Stevie Wonder\'s Original Musiquarium]]\'\', which included four new songs: the ten-minute [[funk]] classic "[[Do I Do]]" (which featured [[Dizzy Gillespie]]), "That Girl" (one of the year\'s biggest singles to chart on the [[R&B]] side), "Front Line", a narrative about a soldier in the [[Vietnam War]] that Wonder wrote and sang in the first person, and "[[Ribbon in the Sky]]", one of his many classic compositions. He also gained a No. 1 hit that year in collaboration with [[Paul McCartney]] in their paean to racial harmony, "[[Ebony and Ivory]]".

In 1983, Wonder performed the song "[[Stay Gold (Outsiders theme)|Stay Gold]]", the theme to [[Francis Ford Coppola]]\'s film adaptation of [[S. E. Hinton]]\'s novel \'\'[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]\'\'. Wonder wrote the lyrics. In 1983, he scheduled an album to be entitled \'\'People Work, Human Play\'\'. The album never surfaced and instead 1984 saw the release of Wonder\'s soundtrack album for \'\'[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|The Woman in Red]]\'\'. The lead single, "[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]", was a No. 1 pop and R&B hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom, where it was placed 13th in the list of best-selling singles in the UK published in 2002. It went on to win an [[Academy award for best song]] in 1985. The album also featured a guest appearance by [[Dionne Warwick]], singing the duet "It\'s You" with Stevie and a few songs of her own. The following year\'s \'\'[[In Square Circle]]\'\' featured the No. 1 pop hit "[[Part-Time Lover]]". The album also has a Top 10 Hit with "Go Home." It also featured the ballad "[[Overjoyed (Stevie Wonder song)|Overjoyed]]", which was originally written for \'\'Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants"\'\', but did not make the album. He performed "Overjoyed" on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' when he was the host. He was also featured in [[Chaka Khan]]\'s cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]\'s "[[I Feel For You]]", alongside [[Melle Mel]], playing his signature harmonica. In roughly the same period he was also featured on harmonica on [[Eurythmics]]\' single, "[[There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)]]" and [[Elton John]]\'s "[[I Guess That\'s Why They Call It The Blues]]".

Wonder was in a featured duet with [[Bruce Springsteen]] on the all-star charity single for African Famine Relief, "[[We Are the World]]", and he was part of another charity single the following year (1986), the AIDS-inspired "[[That\'s What Friends Are For]]". He played harmonica on the album \'\'[[Dreamland Express]]\'\' by [[John Denver]] in the song "If Ever", a song Wonder co-wrote with Stephanie Andrews; wrote the track "I Do Love You" for [[the Beach Boys]]\' 1985 [[The Beach Boys (album)|self-titled album]]; and played harmonica on "Can\'t Help Lovin\' That Man" on \'\'[[The Broadway Album]]\'\' by [[Barbra Streisand]]. In 1987, Wonder appeared on [[Michael Jackson]]\'s \'\'Bad\'\' album, on the duet "Just Good Friends". Michael Jackson also sang a duet with him entitled "Get It" on Wonder\'s 1987 album \'\'[[Characters (Stevie Wonder album)|Characters]]\'\'. This was a minor hit single, as were "Skeletons" and "You Will Know".

After 1987\'s \'\'Characters\'\' album, Wonder continued to release new material, but at a slower pace. He recorded a soundtrack album for [[Spike Lee]]\'s film \'\'[[Jungle Fever]]\'\' in 1991. From this album, singles and videos were released for "Gotta Have You" and "These Three Words".

\'\'\'Average White Band\'\'\' (also \'\'\'AWB\'\'\') is a Scottish [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] band that had a series of soul and [[disco]] [[hit record|hit]]s between 1974 and 1980. They are best known for their million-selling instrumental track "[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]", and their albums \'\'[[AWB (album)|AWB]]\'\' and \'\'[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]\'\'. The band name was initially proposed by [[Bonnie Bramlett]]. They have influenced others such as the [[Brand New Heavies]], and been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by various musicians including the [[Beastie Boys]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[The Beatnuts]], [[Too Short]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Nas]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]], as well as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]]<ref name="Rockopedia"/> \xe2\x80\x93 making them the fifteenth most sampled act in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/714/alan_gorrie_awb_everybody_be_cool_real |title=Average White Band interview by Pete Lewis, \'Blues & Soul\' August 2011 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> As of 2012, forty years after their formation, they continue to perform.

Duncan and Ball, affectionately known as the Dundee Horns, studied at [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design|Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art]] (now part of the [[University of Dundee]], but which at the time was part of the [[Dundee Institute of Art & Technology]], now known as [[Abertay University]]), and were previously members of [[Mogul Thrash]]. Gorrie and McIntyre had been members of [[Forever More (band)|Forever More]]. McIntyre and McIntosh were used as [[session musician]]s on [[Chuck Berry]]\'s recording of "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band\'s breakthrough was a support slot at [[Eric Clapton]]\'s comeback concert in 1973. [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Records]] released their debut album, \'\'[[Show Your Hand (album)|Show Your Hand]]\'\' (1973), which sold poorly.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3591/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Average White Band|author=Ankeny, Jason |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> Bruce McCaskill, who was Clapton\'s tour manager, liked the band\'s music and agreed to manage them. He borrowed money to take them to the US and to [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] them. McCaskill had many contacts from his days with Clapton and managed to get [[Atlantic Records]] to sign them. The band relocated to Los Angeles and released the follow-up, \'\'[[AWB (album)|AWB]]\'\', better known as \'\'The White Album\'\'. It reached [[record chart|#1]] and was the first of many with renowned producer [[Arif Mardin]].<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1975, the single "[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]" \xe2\x80\x93 taken from the No. 1 \'\'[[AWB (album)|AWB]]\'\' album \xe2\x80\x93 reached No. 1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart. The song knocked Linda Ronstadt\'s "You\'re No Good" out of No. 1 and sold over one million copies. It was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|R.I.A.A.]] in March 1975.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

It was both a tribute to AWB\'s knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band\'s name.

AWB followed up with the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s \'\'[[Cut the Cake (album)|Cut the Cake]]\'\' (1975) and \'\'[[Soul Searching (Average White Band album)|Soul Searching]]\'\' (1976), both big sellers and yielding further [[Top 40]] singles. \'\'Cut the Cake\'\' was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh\'s memory. Their next LP, \'\'Benny & Us\'\', was a collaboration with [[Ben E. King]].<ref name="AMG"/>

After several more albums, AWB\'s audience and sales dwindled. Their 1980 [[disco]] hit "Let\'s Go Round Again" (UK #12),<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Ferrone went on to work with [[Duran Duran]] whilst Hamish Stuart joined [[Paul McCartney]]\'s touring group.<ref name="AMG"/> In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, \'\'Sleepless Nights\'\'.

Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball reunited in 1989 to record \'\'[[Aftershock (Average White Band album)|Aftershock]]\'\'. [[Alex Ligertwood]] (ex-[[Santana (band)|Santana]] and [[Jeff Beck Group]]) also appeared on this album replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band as well. Ligertwood left after the album\'s recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band\'s live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-[[Blood Sweat and Tears]]), who in turn was replaced by Fred "Catfish" Alias in September 1998. Drummer Adam Deitch did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.

Average White Band has continued recording (1997\'s \'\'Soul Tattoo\'\', 1999\'s \'\'Face to Face\'\') and touring since. Ball worked on \'\'Soul Tattoo\'\' with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.

Brian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with [[Hall and Oates]]), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.averagewhiteband.com |title=Averagewhiteband.com |publisher=Averagewhiteband.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718152311/http://www.averagewhiteband.com/| archivedate= 18 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Their line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).

Dunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. And after Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former [[Earth Wind and Fire]] member [[Morris Pleasure]] (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.

Brent Carter (ex-[[Tower of Power]]) has been singing with AWB since 2011.

Gorrie and McIntyre are the only remaining original members of the band.

\'\'\'Mary Christine Brockert\'\'\' (March 5, 1956 \xe2\x80\x93 December 26, 2010), better known by her stage name \'\'\'Teena Marie\'\'\', was an American singer, songwriter, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina<ref>\'\'The Gondolier\'\', Venice High School yearbook, 1974</ref> before taking the stage name Teena Marie; she later acquired the nickname of Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T), given to her by collaborator and friend, [[Rick James]].

She was known for her distinctive soulful vocals, which initially caused many listeners to believe she was black. Her success in [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul (music)|soul]] and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. She played rhythm guitar, [[keyboard instruments|keyboards]], and [[congas]]. She also wrote, produced, sang, and [[Music arranger|arranged]] virtually all of her songs since her 1980 release, \'\'[[Irons in the Fire (album)|Irons in the Fire]]\'\', which she later said was her favorite album.

==Early life (1956\xe2\x80\x931978)==
Mary Christine, or Tina <!-- please do not change this to Teena; she did not use this spelling until she was an adult --> as she was called, was the daughter<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-b-singer-teena-marie-dead-at-54-20101226 "R&B Singer Teena Marie Dead at 54"]. \'\'Rolling Stone\'\'.</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/arts/music/28marie.html "Teena Marie, 1980s R&B Hitmaker, Dies at 54"]. \'\'New York Times\'\'.</ref> of construction worker Thomas Leslie Brockert and his wife, home renovator Mary Anne. She spent her early childhood in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles|Mission Hills]]. Her ethnic heritage was Portuguese, Italian, Irish, and Native American.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In 2005, while visiting [[Louisiana]], she had discovered that her paternal ancestors once lived in New Orleans.<ref>At home with Teena Marie and daughter, Alia Rose. Jet, October 30, 2006</ref><ref name="Teena Marie\'s Life in Pictures">{{cite web|title = Teena Marie\'s Life in Pictures|publisher = [[Essence Magazine]]|date = December 27, 2010| url = http://www.essence.com/entertainment/celebrity_spotlight/teena_marie_life_in_pictures.php#1970| accessdate =December 27, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="Kristin Gray">{{cite web |url=http://www.afro.com/sections/news/afro_briefs/story.htm?storyid=3612 |title=Teena Marie Dead at 54|publisher=afro.com |accessdate=December 28, 2010|date= December 27, 2010|author= Kristin Gray}}</ref> She took to singing naturally, performing [[Harry Belafonte]]\'s \'\'[[Banana Boat Song]]\'\' by age two. She also developed a fondness for singing the songs of [[Motown]], and her self-professed "gift from God" would become fine-tuned as the years progressed.

When she was eight years old, her parents began sending her on auditions which, among other things, netted her an acting role on \'\'[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]\'\', credited as Tina Marie Brockert.<ref>{{IMDb episode|0522460|The Beverly Hillbillies: Doctor Jed Clampett (#3.5) (October 21, 1964)}}</ref> She also sang at the wedding of actor [[Jerry Lewis]]\'s son when she was 10 years old. Reared in a Roman Catholic household, she learned to play the piano under the tutelage of two nuns and later taught herself the guitar, bass, and congas. She would go on to form a semi-professional R&B band with her younger brother Anthony and their cousin.

In the early 1970s, after the family moved to [[Venice, Los Angeles]], Brockert spent her adolescent years in the historically black Venice enclave of Oakwood, nicknamed "Venice Harlem".  There, she would acquire a strong spiritual influence from neighborhood matriarch Berthalynn Jackson, an African American who would become her [[godparent|godmother]].<ref name="Teena Marie\'s Life in Pictures"/><ref name="Kristin Gray"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Biography |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |publisher=ivoryqueenofsoul.com |date=May 12, 2008 |url=http://www.ivoryqueenofsoul.com/bio.htm |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}</ref>

While attending [[Venice High School (Los Angeles, California)|Venice High School]], Brockert joined the Summer Dance Production, and also had the female lead in the school\'s production of \'\'[[The Music Man]]\'\'.<ref>Venice High School yearbook \'\'Gondolier, 1974\'\'</ref> She also fronted a local Venice rock band "Truvair" in 1974\xe2\x80\x931975; the band\'s members were some of her fellow high school students.

Following graduation, Brockert juggled auditioning for various record companies with studying English Literature at [[Santa Monica College]]. She credited her love of reading with helping her to write lyrics.

==Career==

===Gordy era (1979\xe2\x80\x931982)===
In 1976, Brockert (as the lead singer member of a band she assembled which included long-time friend Mickey Boyce) gained an introduction to Motown Records staff producer [[Hal Davis]] (best known for his work with [[Brenda Holloway]] and the [[Jackson 5]]). It led to an audition for a film about orphans being developed by Motown. The project was shelved, but label boss [[Berry Gordy]] decided to sign her as a solo act, impressed with her singing but having no need for a musical group. She recorded unreleased material with a number of different producers over the next few years, before being spotted by labelmate [[Rick James]] who was immediately impressed with her sound. He introduced her to his keyboard player, R. David Turner, who eventually wrote "Out on a Limb" and "Lovergirl" for her launching her to number 1 on the charts.. Turner would remain one of her closest friends up until the time of her death. Several tabloids have claimed that Turner is the father of her daughter Alia Rose.  Some of the earlier, unreleased material has since been made available on the compilation album \'\'First Class Love: Rare Tee\'\'.  At the time, James, already established as a successful recording artist, was on tap to produce for [[Diana Ross]] but changed his mind and decided to work with Brockert. The result was debut album release, \'\'[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]\'\'. The album was, at one point, due to be credited to "Teena Tryson", but ultimately was put out under "Teena Marie", the name by which she would be known throughout her career. It scored Teena Marie her first top-ten R&B hit, "[[List of disco artists (S-Z)|I\'m a Sucker for Your Love]]" (#8 Black Singles Chart),<ref name="allmusic.com">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4844|pure_url=yes}}</ref> a [[duet]] with James. Neither the album nor its packaging had her picture on it, and many radio programmers assumed she was African-American during the earliest months of her career.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> This myth was disproved when she performed her debut hit with James on \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\' in 1979, becoming the show\'s first white female guest (she would appear on the show eight more times, more than any other white act).

In 1980, her second album, \'\'[[Lady T (Teena Marie album)|Lady T]]\'\', would have her portrait on the cover upon its release. It\'s also noted for having production from [[Richard Rudolph]] (the widower of R&B singer [[Minnie Riperton]]). Teena Marie had asked Berry Gordy to contact Rudolph and secure his input as Rick James was unavailable and she felt unprepared to be sole producer of her own material. Rudolph intended for the song he penned, "Now That I Have You", to be sung by his wife, but it was later given to Teena Marie.<ref>[[Minnie Riperton#Posthumous recordings]]</ref> Rudolph also co-composed the single "Behind The Groove", which reached number 21 on the black singles chart and No. 6 on the U.K. singles chart in 1980.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> The song would also be included on the soundtrack of [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]] on the Fever 105 soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006SM8W/$%7B0%7D |title=Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Vol. 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Fever 105: Rene & Angela, Whispers: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Another notable track, "Too Many Colors", featured Rudolph\'s and Riperton\'s then 7-year-old daughter, [[Maya Rudolph]], who became Teena Marie\'s god-daughter.

Also in 1980, Teena Marie released her third LP, \'\'[[Irons in the Fire (album)|Irons in the Fire]]\'\', for which she handled all writing and production herself, including the horn and rhythm arrangements of her band and all backing vocals, all considered rare at the time for a female artist.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The single "I Need Your Lovin\'" (#37 Pop, No. 9 Black Singles) brought Teena Marie her first [[top 40]] hit. This single also peaked at No. 28 in the UK chart. That same year, Teena Marie appeared on James\'s hugely successful album, \'\'[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]\'\', with the duet "Fire and Desire". In an interview, Teena Marie said she had a fever at the time yet managed to record her vocals in one take. After the session, she was driven to a hospital. The two would perform the single at the 2004 [[BET Awards]], which would be their last TV appearance with one another as Rick James died later that year, however Turner would re-join her one more time to play at the awards where he would win his 5th award.<ref>[http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2004/06/2004_bet_awards_wrap/ News | VIBE]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

Teena Marie continued her success with Motown in 1981, with the release of \'\'[[It Must Be Magic]]\'\' (#2 Black Albums Chart), her first gold record, which included her then biggest hit on R&B, "[[Square Biz]]" (#3 Black Singles). Other notable tracks include "Portuguese Love" (featuring a brief, uncredited cameo by James, No. 54 Black Singles), the title track "It Must be Magic" (#30 Black Singles), and album only track "Yes Indeed", which she cited as a personal favorite.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1982, Teena Marie got into a heated legal battle with Motown Records over her contract and disagreements about releasing her new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelbaisden.com/features/bside/teena-marie |title=Teena Marie |publisher=Michaelbaisden.Com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> The lawsuit resulted in "The Brockert Initiative", which made it illegal for a record company to keep an artist under contract without releasing new material for that artist. In such instances, artists are able to sign and release with another label instead of being held back by an unsupportive one. Teena Marie commented on the law in an \'\'[[LA Times]]\'\' article, saying, "It wasn\'t something I set out to do. I just wanted to get away from Motown and have a good life. But it helped a lot of people, like [[Luther Vandross]] and the [[Mary Jane Girls]], and a lot of different artists, to be able to get out of their contracts."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/29/entertainment/et-teena29 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Teena Marie remains true to R&B | date=December 29, 2004}}</ref>  She left Motown as the label\'s most successful white solo act.

===Epic era (1983\xe2\x80\x931990)===
Contacted by [[Epic Records]] in the Fall of 1982 after expressing dismay over her Motown contract, Teena Marie signed a worldwide deal with the [[Columbia Records]] subsidiary that also allowed her to establish her own publishing company, Midnight Magnet.  Epic released the concept album \'\'[[Robbery (Teena Marie album)|Robbery]]\'\', which featured the hit "Fix It" (#21 R&B), as well as "Shadow Boxing" and "Casanova Brown." The latter was one of a number of tracks Teena Marie would write over the years about her real-life romance with one-time mentor Rick James. The relationship had ended by that point, but the two would continue a sometimes tempestuous friendship, until James\' death in August 2004. In 1984, Teena Marie released her biggest-selling album, \'\'[[Starchild (Teena Marie album)|Starchild]]\'\'. It yielded her biggest hit "[[Lovergirl]]", which peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in March 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5yMEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=March 30, 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> It also peaked at No. 9 on the R&B chart. The label also released the moderate R&B hit "Out on a Limb", which peaked at No. 56 on the R&B chart, but didn\'t break the Hot 100. "14k" was featured on the soundtrack of the film \'\'[[Goonies]]\'\' (1985) but was not a hit (only making the U.S. R&B charts at #87).

In 1986, Teena Marie released a rock music-influenced [[concept album]] titled \'\'[[Emerald City (Teena Marie album)|Emerald City]]\'\'. It was controversial with her established fan base and not as successful as its predecessors. She also recorded another rock-influenced track, "Lead Me On", co-produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], for the soundtrack of the box office hit film, \'\'[[Top Gun]]\'\' (1986). In 1988, however, she returned to [[R&B]] and [[funk]] , releasing the critically acclaimed album \'\'[[Naked to the World]]\'\'.  That album contained the hit "[[Ooo La La La]]", which reached the top of [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart and was her only No. 1 single on that chart. During her 1988 \'\'Naked to the World\'\' concert tour, she suffered a fall and was hospitalized for six months.

Teena Marie released \'\'[[Ivory (Teena Marie album)|Ivory]]\'\' in the fall of 1990; it scored no pop hits, but it did experience two R&B hits: "Here\'s Looking at You" (#11 R&B) and "If I Were a Bell" (#8 R&B).

===Hiatus, \'\'Passion Play\'\' and \'\'Black Rain\'\' (1991\xe2\x80\x932003)===
During the 1990s, Teena Marie\'s classic R&B, soul, and funk records were either [[Music sampling|sampled]] by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists or covered by R&B divas. Teena Marie herself is regarded as something of a pioneer in helping to bring hip-hop to the mainstream by becoming one of the first artists of her time to rap one of her singles\xe2\x80\x94the aforementioned "Square Biz". In the hip-hop portion of that song, she mentions some of her inspirations: [[Sarah Vaughn]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Maya Angelou]], and [[Nikki Giovanni]]. In 1996, the [[Fugees]] paid tribute to her by interpolating the chorus of her 1988 hit, "Ooo, La, La, La", into its own "Fu-Gee-La".

In the fall of 1994, Teena Marie released \'\'[[Passion Play (Teena Marie album)|Passion Play]]\'\' on her independent label, Sarai Records.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vibe Media Group|title=Vibe|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dCwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=November  1994|publisher=Vibe Media Group|page=88|issn=1070-4701}}</ref> Lacking the backing of a major label, this album sold less well than her earlier work, but was well received by fans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Subsequently, Teena Marie devoted most of her time to raising her daughter Alia Rose<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=teena+marie+Alia+Rose |title=teena marie Alia Rose |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> (who has since adopted the stage name "Rose Le Beau" and is pursuing her own singing career). During the late 1990s, Teena Marie made appearances (as herself) on the TV sitcoms \'\'[[The Steve Harvey Show]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Parkers]]\'\'. She also began work on a new album, titled \'\'Black Rain\'\'. She was unable to secure a major label deal for this, and did not want to put it out on her own Sarai label in light of the modest sales of \'\'Passion Play\'\'. However, a version pressed for promotional purposes was widely [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] among fans. This contained the tracks, "The Mackin\' Game", "I\'ll Take the Pressure", "Baby, I\'m Your Fiend", "My Body\'s Hungry", "Ecstasy", "I\'m on Fire", "Watcha Got 4 Me", "Black Rain", "1999", "Butterflies", "Spanish Harlem", "Blackberry Playa", "The Perfect Feeling", and "Rainbow Outro". Most of these tracks resurfaced on the later albums: \'\'La Do\xc3\xb1a\'\', \'\'Sapphire\'\', \'\'Congo Square\'\' and \'\'Beautiful\'\'; in some cases (e.g. "The Mackin Game", and "Spanish Harlem", the latter of which was retitled "Maria Bonita" on \'\'Beautiful\'\') in significantly reworked versions.

Her "Square Biz" was remade as "Hollywood Square Biz" on the hit TV game show \'\'[[Hollywood Squares]]\'\' from 2002\xe2\x80\x932004.

===\'\'La Do\xc3\xb1a\'\' to \'\'Congo Square\'\' (2004\xe2\x80\x932010)===
After a 14-year sabbatical from the national spotlight, Teena Marie returned to her musical career by signing with the Classics sub-label of the successful hip-hop label, [[Cash Money Records]].  She released her comeback album, \'\'[[La Do\xc3\xb1a]]\'\', in 2004, and follow up \'\'Sapphire\'\', in 2006. \'\'La Do\xc3\xb1a\'\' became a [[Gold album|gold-certified]] success (and the highest-charting album of her career, peaking at No. 6 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] chart) on the basis of the [[Al Green]]-sampled "I\'m Still In Love" (#23 R&B, No. 70 Pop) and a duet with the late [[Gerald Levert]], "A Rose by Any Other Name". Teena Marie was nominated for a [[47th Grammy Awards|2005 Grammy Award]] for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "Still in Love". Teena Marie quickly followed this success with the release of \'\'[[Sapphire (Teena Marie album)|Sapphire]]\'\' in 2006. While sales were not as strong this time (the album peaked at No. 24 on the Pop Chart), the release did give her yet another R&B Top-40 hit, "Ooh Wee" (#32); it also reunited her (on "God Has Created" and "Cruise Control") with [[Smokey Robinson]], the early Motown mentor whose style she had emulated on early hits such as "Young Love". Teena Marie parted ways with Ca$h Money records after the release of \'\'Sapphire\'\'.

On September 19, 2008, Teena Marie performed in concert at [[B.B. King#B.B. King\'s Blues Club|B.B. King\'s Blues Club]] in New York City. Teena took this time to play a couple of finished tracks from her upcoming album, \'\'[[Congo Square (album)|Congo Square]]\'\', and she received a positive response from the crowd. \'\'Congo Square\'\' was released on June 9, 2009 on [[Stax Records|Stax/Concord Records]]. She has described the album as "personal and spiritual" and indicated that it was more jazz-influenced than most of her previous work. "Can\'t Last a Day", a duet with [[Faith Evans]], leaked to the Internet in March 2009. Teena Marie says of Evans, "It was after I had recorded the song ("Can\'t Last a Day") I got the idea to put Faith on it. I\'ve always loved Faith and her vocal style. She reminds me of me. Her correlation with [[Biggie Smalls|Biggie]] \xe2\x80\x94 having a career with him and without him \xe2\x80\x93 reminds me of me and [[Rick James|Rick]]. I feel like she\'s a younger me. Of the younger ladies, she\'s the one I love most."<ref>{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://blog.singersroom.com/celebs/index.php/2009/03/24/faith-evans-gets-soulful-with-teena-marie/ |title=Faith Evans gets Soulful with Teena Marie! |publisher=Blog.singersroom.com |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

Meanwhile, with regard to her early-life inspirations for \'\'Congo Square\'\', in January 2010 Teena Marie told Lee Tyler, editor of \'\'[[Blues & Soul]]\'\' magazine: "I wanted to do songs that reflected the things that I loved when I was growing up. Every single song on the record is dedicated to someone, or some musical giant that I loved. \'The Pressure\' is dedicated to Rick James; \'Can\'t Last a Day\' is dedicated to the Gamble & Huff sound \xe2\x80\x93 the Philly International sound\'. Then \'Baby I Love You\' and \'Ear Candy\' are dedicated to Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield \xe2\x80\x93 with memories of riding down Crenshaw in LA in jeeps and bumping to music on \'\'the 808\'\' i.e. Roland TR-808 drum machine. While \'Miss Coretta\' is, of course, dedicated to Mrs. Coretta Scott King, the late wife of Martin Luther King."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/489/the_return_of_lady_tee/ |title=Teena Marie interview by Lee Tyler, \'Blues & Soul\' January 2010 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref>

Sales-wise, the album proved another success, reaching the Top 20 on Billboard\'s Top 200, and giving Teena Marie yet another Top 10 R&B chart entry. In 2010, Teena Marie continued to be a headliner on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], appearing regularly at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and other venues until just before her death.

At the time of her death, Teena Marie had been in the process of completing her fourteenth album, \'\'[[Beautiful (Teena Marie album)|Beautiful]]\'\'. It was finished posthumously by her daughter, Alia Rose. \'\'Beautiful\'\' was released on January 15, 2013.

==Personal life==
Teena Marie never married however before her death she told [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] that the love of her life was R. David Turner but she would never let him know because he was so much younger than her. She gave birth to a daughter named Alia Rose in 1991. When asked who the father was she replied "the love of my life." The Hollywood Reporter and other media sources<ref>who?</ref> have listed Turner as the Father. As of 2009, Alia Rose sings under the name Rose LeBeau.<ref>{{cite news |author=Emily Cary |title=Teena Marie gets \'Up Close and Personal\' at Birchmere |publisher=[[The Washington Examiner]] |date=August 27, 2009 |page=33 |url= http://washingtonexaminer.com/entertainment/2009/08/teena-marie-gets-close-and-personal-birchmere |accessdate=December 27, 2010}}</ref>

Throughout her career, Teena Marie lived in [[Inglewood, California]] and [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] before settling in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] in the mid-1980s.

Teena Marie was godmother to actress and comedian [[Maya Rudolph]] and to [[Marvin Gaye]]\'s daughter [[Nona Gaye]].  She also cared for Rick James\' son, Rick, Jr. and family friend Jeremiah O\'Neal. [[Lenny Kravitz]] posted a video in which he said that Teena Marie had taken him into her home and helped him when he was struggling early in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundspike.com/news/article/1288-teena_marie_news_artists_deliver_teena_marie_remembrances.html |title=SoundSpike, December 27, 2010 |publisher=Soundspike.com |date=December 27, 2010 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name>{{cite web | last =Ziegbe | first =Mawuse | title = Teena Marie Remembered By Lenny Kravitz, Swizz Beatz, Q-Tip | work = MTV | date = December 27, 2010 | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1654945/teena-marie-remembered-by-lenny-kravitz-swizz-beatz-qtip.jhtml | accessdate =January 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Death==
In 2004, while Teena Marie was sleeping in a hotel room, a large picture frame fell and struck her on the head. The blow caused a serious concussion that would result in momentary seizures for the rest of her life. On the afternoon of December 26, 2010, Teena Marie was found unresponsive by her daughter Alia Rose at her home in Pasadena, California.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goffard |first=Christopher |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-teena-marie-20101227,0,2805459.story |title=\'\'Los Angeles Times\'\', December 26, 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=December 26, 2010 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=autopsy/> On December 30, 2010, an autopsy was performed by the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] coroner, who found no signs of apparent trauma or discernible cause of death and<ref name=autopsy>{{cite web|last=Ziegbe|first=Mawuse|title=Teena Marie Autopsy Fails To Pinpoint Cause Of Death|publisher=MTV|date=December 30, 2010|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1655129/teena-marie-autopsy-fails-pinpoint-cause-death.jhtml|accessdate=January 5, 2011}}</ref> concluded she had died from natural causes.<ref name=autopsy/><ref>{{cite web|author=the CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/28/teena.marie.dead |title=Notice of Teena Marie\'s death at CNN.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> She had suffered a [[tonic\xe2\x80\x93clonic seizure]] just one month before her death.<ref name=death>{{cite web|title=Teena Marie Died During Sunday Nap|work=[[TMZ.com|TMZ]]|date=December 27, 2010|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/12/27/teena-marie-dead-dies-lovergirl-singer-grand-mal-seizure-nap-sunday-death|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref>

\'\'\'Wild Cherry\'\'\' was an American [[funk rock]] band best known for their song "[[Play That Funky Music]]".

==History==

===Early lineups (1970\xe2\x80\x931974)===
Rob Parissi (lead vocals & guitar) was raised in the steel mill town of [[Mingo Junction, Ohio]]. Parissi graduated from [[Mingo High School]] in 1968. Rob formed the band Wild Cherry in 1970 in [[Steubenville]], [[Ohio]], one mile (1.6 km) north of Mingo Junction along the Ohio River. The band\'s name "Wild Cherry" was taken from a box of cough drops while Rob was recuperating from a brief hospital stay. The band played the Ohio Valley region, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] and the rest of the Northern West Virginia panhandle, and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. The original lineup included: Ben Difabbio (drums and vocals), Louie Osso (guitar, lead and background vocals) from [[Steubenville, Ohio]], Larry Brown (bass, lead and background vocals) from [[Weirton, West Virginia]], Larry Mader (keyboards, lead and background vocals) from [[East Springfield, Ohio]],  Over time, the band members changed, with Osso, Brown, and Mader leaving the band, replaced by Rob\'s cousin, Coogie Stoddart (guitar, lead and background vocals) and Joe Buchmelter (bass). Buchmelter was soon replaced by Buckie Lusk.

Several records before "Play That Funky Music" were released under their own label during the early 1970s, including "You Can Be High (But Lay Low)," date unknown, and "Something Special On Your Mind," in 1971. The music at this stage was pure rock music, not funk. Wild Cherry eventually gained a record contract with Brown Bag Records, owned and operated by the late Terry Knight of Terry Knight And The Pack fame, who later on without Terry became [[Grand Funk Railroad]], who Terry also produced at the time for Capitol records. Several demos and singles on Knight\'s Brown Bag label distributed by United Artists were produced including "Get Down" (1973) and "Show Me Your Badge" (1973).

The band broke up when a disillusioned Parissi left the music scene to become the manager of a local steakhouse. Rob quickly realized that the steakhouse gig was not going to cut it. As his enthusiasm for the music eventually returned, Rob decided to give the business one last shot.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Later lineups (1975\xe2\x80\x931979)===
Parissi re-formed the band with new musicians. The new lineup consisted of [[Bryan Bassett]] (guitar/vocals), Ron Beitle (drums) (both from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]), and [[Allen Wentz]] (bass guitar/synthesizer/vocals), who hailed from [[Detroit, Michigan]]. As the quartet began to perform non-stop and build a huge, devoted following in the Pittsburgh area, they were repeatedly asked by listeners to play more dance music. [[Disco]] was beginning its rule on the radio and the dance floor. At the 2001 Club in Pittsburgh, a table full of black fans kept coming to the stage and teasing: "Are you white boys gonna play some funky music?" One night during a break between sets, drummer Ron Beitle, in a group meeting in the dressing room, uttered the phrase: "Play That Funky Music, White Boy." On the way back to the stage to play the next set, Rob Parissi was immediately inspired to write a song around the phrase, on a drink order pad with a pen borrowed from the bartender. The song took a total of 5 minutes to write. When the band went into the studio to record the song, studio engineer Ken Hamann was blown away by the potential hit and brought the band to the attention of [[Sweet City Records]], distributed by Epic/CBS, which then immediately signed the group. Parissi had intended to record the song as the B-side to a cover version of the [[Commodores]]\' "I Feel Sanctified," but the label suggested it as the A-side. During the recording of the first album, [[Mark Avsec]] was hired as a session keyboardist on two of the album\'s tracks, "Nowhere To Run" and "The Lady Wants Your Money," and was asked to join the band after the album was released and the group was about to embark on its first tour.

"Play That Funky Music" became a huge hit when released in 1976, peaking at number one on both the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] [[R&B]] and pop charts. Both the single and Wild Cherry\'s self-titled debut album went platinum. "Play That Funky Music" was No. 1 on the Billboard charts for 3 weeks. The band was named Best Pop Group of the Year by [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]], and received an [[American Music Award]] for Top [[R&B]] Single of the Year, as well as a pair of [[Grammy]] nominations for Best New Vocal Group and Best [[R&B]] Performance by a Group or Duo that year, adding to their success. Parissi did not attend the AMA awards and radio personality [[Wolfman Jack]] accepted the award on the band\'s behalf.

Their 1977 album, \'\'[[Electrified Funk]]\'\'<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/electrified-funk-mw0000844943</ref> and 1978 album \'\'[[I Love My Music]]\'\' did not produce any top 20 hits, while their 1979 album \'\'[[Only the Wild Survive]]\'\' didn\'t produce a top 100 single.  "Hot to Trot" was a minor follow-up hit in some non U.S. markets.

Although it was never a chart hit, the song "1 2 3 Kind Of Love" had the right feel for the [[beach music]] clubs along the North and South Carolina coasts; it continues to be popular there today, and the song is included in the beach music anthology series by Ripete Records.

One musician who played with the band during their latter days was guitarist/vocalist [[Donnie Iris]] (ex-[[the Jaggerz]]). Donnie was credited on their fourth and final album. Mark Avsec partnered up with Donnie following the demise of Wild Cherry to form Donnie Iris and The Cruisers, who had a successful career of their own.

Early bandmember Coogie Stoddart returned to perform with Wild Cherry beginning with the tour to support \'\'Electrified Funk\'\'. Coogie recorded the third album, \'\'I Love My Music\'\', with the band. On that album is recorded one of Coogie\'s original songs, "If You Want My Love," on which Coogie shares lead vocals with Rob Parissi. (The album jacket for \'\'I Love My Music\'\' incorrectly states that all songs were written by Rob Parissi; the album\'s label is correct.) Coogie Stoddart toured with the group in support of \'\'I Love My Music\'\', but left before the follow-up album, \'\'Only the Wild Survive\'\' was recorded.

===Post-breakup (1980\xe2\x80\x93present)===
In addition to becoming the keyboardist for newly formed [[Donnie Iris|Donnie Iris and the Cruisers]] (see above) at the beginning of the 1980s, \'\'\'Mark Avsec\'\'\' immersed himself in writing and producing for other bands.  One of his compositions, "[[She Don\'t Know Me]]," originally written for the band, La Flavour (who later evolved into "Fair Warning"), would become one of the first hits for the then-fledgling band, [[Bon Jovi]].  Avsec would later team up with fellow Cruiser [[Kevin Valentine]] to record under the moniker [[Cellarful of Noise]] in 1985, releasing two albums with this project.  In addition to continuing his musical pursuits, Avsec has since become a copyright lawyer.

\'\'\'Allen Wentz\'\'\' moved to NYC after leaving the band and became a session synthesist, playing on many records and jingles. He has produced a number of indie projects over the years, scored a few indie films, and has had some song placements. He still composes and records under different aliases, as well as under his own name. Over the years he has worked with artists ranging from [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Roberta Flack]], to [[Cyndi Lauper]].

Guitarist \'\'\'Bryan Bassett\'\'\' went on to a successful producing/engineering career at King Snake Studio in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]], [[Florida|FL]] working with many great blues artists. His guitar playing easily earned him a spot with [[Foghat]] and [[Molly Hatchet]] in the \'90s. He continues to tour with Foghat and work in his studio as a freelance engineer/producer. Bryan Bassett has also served as a Board Governor and Board Advisor for the Florida Chapter of NARAS.

\'\'\'Rob Parissi\'\'\' moved to Miami in 1979 after Wild Cherry disbanded, met [[Bobby Caldwell]] there, and they worked together forming a band for Caldwell to tour Japan and the United States. In 1980, Parissi moved to [[New York City]], met members of [[Billy Squier]]\'s band, and did recording sessions with them and at the same time, also met Ellie Greenwich and together with Jeff Kent, they wrote songs, one of which was recorded by [[Ellen Foley]] ("Boys In The Attic") and became a hit in England and other parts of Europe. He also was a co-producer along with [[Gary U.S. Bonds]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] on Gary\'s \'\'[[Dedication (Gary U.S. Bonds album)|Dedication]]\'\' album in 1980/81 that produced the hit, "This Little Girl (Is Mine)," selling over 500,000 copies for which Rob was awarded another gold album. In early 1982, Rob moved back to his home town of Mingo Junction, Ohio to be close to his family and in the late 1980s while living in that area, went into radio becoming a program director and morning air personality briefly at Z-107, which changed formats while there, and switched to Eagle 107. During the 1980s Rob played at several venues in the Steubenville/Pittsburgh area.  He now resides between homes in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Florida, and is currently writing and recording in the Smooth Jazz genre, as well as vocal projects. His last CD is The Real Deal, which is an all vocal set.  Last August 11, 2013, the people of his home town in Mingo Junction, Ohio, renamed the longest street there as Rob Parissi Boulevard, and declared August 11 every year afterward, as Rob Parissi day.  He and his wife Ilona established a scholarship endowment for his former consolidated high school, now named Indian Creek high school, and he returns every year around August 11 to do a charity fundraiser for that scholarship endowment, along with many other musicians from the area contributing their generous time and efforts to that worthy cause.

Drummer \'\'\'Ron Beitle\'\'\' went on to join and perform with several other rock bands following the dissolution of Wild Cherry.  He continues to be active in the music industry and currently plays drums for the Nied\'s Hotel Band in Lawrenceville, PA.<ref>[http://nieds.myfastsite.net/band/members/ron-beitle-drums/ Nieds Hotel Band >> Ron Beitle- Drums] Retrieved 6-30-2012.</ref>

[[File:Rufusthomaspoison.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rufus\' 1988 album for Alligator Records, \'\'That Woman Is Poison!\'\']]
\'\'\'Rufus Thomas, Jr.\'\'\' (March 26, 1917 \xe2\x80\x93 December 15, 2001) was an American [[rhythm and blues]], [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer and [[comedian]] from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], who recorded on [[Sun Records]] in the 1950s and on [[Stax Records]] in the 1960s and 1970s. He was the father of soul singer [[Carla Thomas]] and keyboard player [[Marvell Thomas]]. A third child, Vaneese, a former French teacher, has a [[recording studio]] in upstate New York and sings for television commercials.

==Early life and education==
Born a sharecropper\'s son in the rural community of [[Cayce, Mississippi]], Thomas moved to Memphis with his family when he was two years old. His mother was \xe2\x80\x9ca church woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas made his artistic debut at the age of six playing a frog in a school theatrical production. Much later in life, he would impersonate all kinds of animals: screeching cats, funky chickens and penguins, and mournful dogs. By age 10, he was a tap dancer, performing in amateur productions at Memphis\' [[Booker T. Washington]] High School. 

Thomas attended one semester at [[Tennessee State University|Tennessee A&I University]], but due to economic constraints left to pursue a career as a professional entertainer, joining up in 1936 with the [[Rabbit Foot Minstrels]], an all-black revue that toured the South. He then worked for 22 years at a textile plant and did not leave that job until about 1963, around the time of his \xe2\x80\x9cDog\xe2\x80\x9d hits. He started at WDIA in 1951 (despite biographies placing his start a year earlier). At WDIA, he hosted an afternoon show called \'\'Hoot and Holler\'\'. WDIA, featuring an African-American format, was known as "the mother station of the Negroes" and became an important source of blues and R&B music for a generation, its audience consisting of white as well as black listeners. Thomas\'s mentor was Nat D. Williams, a pioneer black deejay at [[WDIA]] as well as Thomas\'s high school history teacher, columnist for black newspapers, and host of an amateur show at Memphis\'s Palace Theater. For years Thomas himself took hosting duties for the amateur show and, in that capacity, is credited with the discovery of [[B. B. King]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Professional singing career==
{{Tone|date=August 2008}}
He made his professional singing debut at the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Club]] on [[Beale Street]] in Memphis, filling in for another singer at the last minute. He made his first [[78 rpm]] record in 1943 for the Star Talent label in Texas, "I\'ll Be a Good Boy", backed with "I\'m So Worried."

He also became a long-standing on-air personality with [[WDIA]], one of the first radio stations in the US to feature an all-black staff and programming geared toward blacks. His celebrity was such that in 1953 he recorded an "answer record" to [[Big Mama Thornton]]\'s hit, [[Hound Dog (song)|"Hound Dog"]] called "Bear Cat" released on [[Sun Records]]. Although the song was the label\'s first hit, a copyright-infringement suit ensued and nearly bankrupted [[Sam Phillips]]\' record label. Later, Rufus was one of the African-American artists released by Sam Phillips as he oriented his label more toward white audiences and signed [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The late, great Johnny Ace and the transition from R & B to rock \'n\' roll|first=James M.|last=Salem|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2001|
ISBN=0-252-06969-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatconsumesme.com/2009/posts-ive-written/sam-phillips-and-the-remix/|title=Sam Phillips and The Remix|publisher=Whatconsumesme.com|accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>

The prime of Rufus\' recording career came in the 1960s and early 1970s, when he was on the roster of Memphis label, Stax, having one of the first hit sides at the historic soul and blues label, "[[Walking the Dog]]" (number 5 R&B, number 10 Pop), in 1963. Rufus is thus the first, and still the only, father to debut in the Hot 100\'s top 10 after his daughter debuted there. Rufus\' daughter Carla also reached number 10, with "Gee Whiz (Look At His Eyes)" on 27 March 1961. At Stax, Rufus was often backed by Booker T. and the MG\'s or the Bar-Kays.

The early 1970s brought him three major hits, including "[[(Do The) Push and Pull]]" in 1970, his only number one R&B hit (number 25 Pop). Earlier that year, "Do the Funky Chicken" had reached number 5 R&B and number 28 Pop. A third dance-oriented release in 1971, "The Breakdown" climbed to number 2 R&B and number 31 Pop. He had several more less successful hits until Stax closed its doors in the mid-\'70s.

Late in his career, for years, Rufus performed at the [[Porretta Soul Festival]] in [[Porretta Terme]], Italy. The outdoor amphitheater in which he performed has been renamed "Rufus Thomas Park." Highlights of his career included calming an unruly crowd at the Wattstax Festival in 1972 and performing with James Brown\'s band.

He played an important part in the Stax reunion of 1988, and had a small role in the 1989 Jim Jarmusch film, \'\'Mystery Train\'\'. Thomas released an album of straight-ahead blues, \'\'That Woman is Poison!\'\', with Alligator Records in 1990. In 1996, Rufus and William Bell headlined at the Olympics in Atlanta. In 1997, Rufus released an album, \'\'Rufus Live!,\'\' on Ecko Records.

Thomas was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2001. He was interviewed by the public radio program \'\'[[American Routes]]\'\' (aired in February 2002). His last appearance was in the D.A. Pennebaker-directed documentary \'\'Only the Strong Survive\'\' (2003), in which he co-starred with his daughter Carla.

===Early years and influences===
Ron Holloway was born to Winston and Marjorie Holloway, avid jazz fans who met while attending [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C. Holloway recalls his father adding to his collection of  [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] and [[Blue Note]] jazz albums; something he has kept up until the present day. Holloway\'s parents, while not musicians, provided a nurturing musical environment for their son.<ref name="Kennedyctr1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=10377&source_type=B|title=Ron Holloway|work=Biographical information from the Kennedy Center|publisher=The John F.

After high school graduation, Holloway routinely practiced 8\xe2\x80\x9312 hours a day along with sitting in with bands of all kinds, in [[jam sessions]], which resulted in broadening his versatility. He became familiar with a wide variety of [[genres]]. Holloway would frequently perform with jazz, R&B, [[funk]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[blues]], [[Country music|country]] and [[folk music]] groups, within the same week.<ref name="It was not unusual to find him sitting-in with...">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/holloway-ron-ronald-edward|title=Holloway, Ron (Ronald Edward)|last=Porter|first=Lewis|year=2000|publisher=jazz.com|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Folk music group">{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=17441|title=Each the Other\'s Kind|last=Anderson|first=Brett|date=June 4\xe2\x80\x9310, 1999|work=Vol. 19, No.&nbsp;23|publisher=Washington City Paper|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref> As the Washington D.C. music scene continued to thrive in the 1970s, Holloway joined his first D.C. based bands;  popular R&B groups called \'The Sounds of Shea\' and \'Mad Dog & the Lowlifers\'.<ref name=\'The Sounds of Shea\' and \'Mad Dog & the Lowlifers\'>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazette.net/gazette_archive/2000/200043/riverdale/news/30897-1.html|title=Jazz legend plays at Hyattsville\'s Artspin|last=Breningstall|first=Jeremy|date=October 26, 2000|publisher=Gazette Newspaper|accessdate=May 22, 2009}}</ref>

In 1974, Holloway went to see [[Freddie Hubbard]] in concert and brought an [[audio cassette]] tape he\'d made while rehearsing to one of Hubbard\'s recordings. During the intermission he introduced himself and played the tape for Hubbard. After hearing the tape, Hubbard invited Holloway to come back and play with him that Sunday night.

Backed by a [[rhythm section]] composed of local musicians, Rollins invited the young horn players onstage. Holloway joined him on Rollins\' "Playin\' in the Yard".

In the summer of 1977 a new club opened and the performers included Rollins, Hubbard and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. Holloway approached Gillespie\'s dressing room and as he had done with Rollins, brought a tape with him- this time of his performance with Rollins. After Gillespie  listened to the tape, he asked Holloway if he had brought his horn, to which Holloway confessed he hadn\'t because he was concerned about appearing presumptuous.

Holloway was a member of several Root Boy configurations from 1977-1987.<ref name="For 10 wild years Ron Holloway, a native Washingtonian, played in Rootboy Slim\'s raucous, hard-to-categorize Sex Change Band.">{{Cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74031804.html?dids=74031804:74031804&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+12%2C+1992&author=Joe+Brown&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=[Headline+Missing]+Ron+Holloway+Group&pqatl=google|title=Title missing|last=Brown|first=Joe|date=January 12, 1992|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}</ref>

Holloway\'s tenure with [[Root Boy Slim]] overlapped with two other groups. The first was a local funk band called [[Osiris (band)|Osiris]]. Holloway first met Osiris Marsh in 1979 and found their influences included bands with eclectic tastes ranging from [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Earth, Wind, and Fire]], and [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. In addition, Osiris was interested in the culture of ancient [[Egypt]] and [[African American]] [[Traditional music|roots music]]. The members of Osiris were Osiris Marsh on [[lead vocals]], Tony Jones and Tyrone "Ty" Brunson on [[bass guitar]]s, Maceo Bond on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], Brent Mingle on [[guitar]], Jimmy "Sha-Sha" Stapleton on percussion and Holloway on tenor and soprano saxophones. As a band they produced "the most unalloyed, dirty and downright nasty Funk imaginable." <ref name= "Osiris1">Official Osiris Website [http://hem.bredband.net/funkyflyy/osiris/osbio.html Osiris]</ref> Marsh, who wrote or co-wrote the majority of the band\'s songs with Bond and Brunson, produced an [[indie (music)|independent]] studio album on the band\'s own label, "Tomdog", titled \'\'Since Before Our Time\'\' in 1978. In 1979, [[Warner Bros. Records]] picked it up, remixed and repackaged it. Another album, \'\'O-Zone\'\', on [[Marlin Records]], met with similar reviews and faced the same overall inability to overcome the dance floor fever that enticed many funk and soul listeners towards [[Disco music|disco]], as the 1970s came to an end. Holloway played with Osiris from 1979 to 1981.<ref name="The tenure with Rootboy would overlap with a couple of other groups. "I began playing with a funk band called Osiris, which was based on the Washington, D.C. side. Rootboy was based in Takoma Park, on the Maryland side. As if this wasn\'t enough of a coincidence, both groups wound up getting signed by Warner Brothers.

He brought his horn and upon arriving spotted Connors and introduced himself. With an invitation from Connors, he sat in on the next set, getting a good response from the audience.

\'\'\'George Allen Miles, Jr.\'\'\' (September 5, 1947 &ndash; February 26, 2008), known professionally as \'\'\'Buddy Miles\'\'\', was an American [[rock music|rock]] and [[funk music|funk]] [[drummer]], vocalist, composer, and producer. He was a founding member of [[The Electric Flag]] (1967), a member of [[Jimi Hendrix]]\'s [[Band of Gypsys]] (1969-1970), founder and leader of the Buddy Miles Express and later, the Buddy Miles Band. In addition to Jimi Hendrix, Miles played and recorded with [[Carlos Santana]], [[Mike Bloomfield]], and others. In a lighter vein, he sang lead vocals on the popular "[[California Raisins]]" claymation TV commercials and recorded two California Raisins R&B albums.

==Biography and career==

===Early life===
Miles was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on September 5, 1947. Buddy\'s father played upright bass for the likes of [[Duke Ellington]], [[Count Basie]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Dexter Gordon]] and by age 12, Miles Jr had joined Miles sr in his touring band, The Bebops.
Given the [[nickname]] "Buddy" by his aunt after the drummer [[Buddy Rich]], he was often seen as a teenager, hanging out and recording at   Universal Promotions Corporation recording studios, which later became Rainbow Recording Studios.<ref name="Interview with Buddy Miles">{{cite web

===1960s: Early career===
Miles played with a variety of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] acts as a teenager, including [[Ruby & the Romantics]], the [[Delfonics]], and [[Wilson Pickett]]. In 1964, at the age of 16, Miles met Jimi Hendrix at a show in Canada, where both were performing as sidemen for other artists.

In 1967, Miles joined Hendrix in a jam session at the Malibu home of [[Stephen Stills]]. They also went on to play together again in 1968 in both Los Angeles and New York. In the same year, Miles moved to Chicago where he teamed with guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]] and vocalist [[Nick Gravenites]] to form [[The Electric Flag]], a [[blues]]/[[soul music|soul]]/[[rock music|rock]] band. In addition to playing drums, Miles sometimes sang lead vocals for the band, which made its live debut at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in mid-1967.

In early 1968, the band released \'\'[[A Long Time Comin\']]\'\', its first album for Columbia. The Electric Flag\'s second album, \'\'An American Music Band\'\', followed late the same year. Shortly after that release, though, the group disbanded. In the same year, Hendrix used several guest artists, including Miles, during the recording of the album, \'\'[[Electric Ladyland]]\'\'. Miles played drums on one long jam that was eventually split into two album cuts, "Rainy Day, Dream Away" and "Still Raining, Still Dreaming", with a different song, "1983 a Merman I Should Turn To Be", edited in between.

At age 21, after the breakup of The Electric Flag, Miles put together a new band with Jim McCarty, who later became the guitarist for Cactus. This new group performed and recorded as the Buddy Miles Express. In 1969, Hendrix wrote a short poem as a liner note for \'\'Expressway To Your Skull\'\', the first studio album recorded by the Buddy Miles Express. Hendrix went on to produce four of the tracks on the group\'s follow-up album, \'\'Electric Church\'\'. The title of the latter LP was taken from Hendrix\'s poem on the first.

===1970s: More bands and collaborations===
In 1970, after the Buddy Miles Express split up, Miles began a collaboration with Hendrix and bassist Billy Cox. Together, they formed \'\'Band of Gypsys\'\', producing one self-titled live album before disbanding.

Later in 1970, while recording the album \'\'We Got To Live Together\'\', Buddy Miles learned of the death of Hendrix, which he mentions on the inner cover of the album. Released in 1971, \'\'We Got To Live Together\'\' was produced by Miles and Robin McBride. It comprises five songs, including the instrumental "Easy Greasy". The other cuts on the album were "Runaway Child (Little Miss Nothin)", "Walking Down the Highway", "We Got To Live Together" and "Take It Off Him and Put It On Me". All the songs were written by Miles with C. Karp except for the latter. With its high energy drumming, funky overtones and big horns, this album was described as quintessential Buddy Miles.

Also in 1971, though The Electric Flag had been inactive for nearly three years, Columbia released a greatest hits album. Three years later, in 1974, Miles and The Electric Flag re-formed briefly and released another album, \'\'The Band Kept Playing\'\', on the Atlantic label.

Miles went on to produce other records as the Buddy Miles Band. One song he had written and recorded with the [[Band of Gypsys]], "Them Changes", was again recorded by Miles with his own band and released by [[Mercury Records]] soon after Hendrix\'s death. Miles\' former Band Of Gypsys sideman, Billy Cox, performed bass guitar on this track. The band also included bassist [[David Hull (musician)|David Hull]] (who would go on to work with [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of [[Aerosmith]]), as well as guitarist Charlie Karp, of the bands Farrenheit  and [[James Montgomery (singer)|The James Montgomery Blues Band]]. When the Buddy Miles Band released its live album, it again included "Them Changes", which had become Miles\' signature song.

Miles would see the song released yet a fourth time on a collaborative live record he made with [[Carlos Santana]]. This particular version was particularly notable for its intense energy, horn lines, and the blazing guitar work supplied by a very young and energetic Santana. Yet again in 1973, Miles recorded an album with [[The Gun (band)|The Gun]]\'s [[Adrian Gurvitz]] called \'\'Chapter VII\'\'. The album cover included photos of Miles and his family along with some shots of Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix, and Sly Stone.

Miles would then go on to be signed by the 70s-80s era record label, [[Casablanca Records]], best known for its rock act, [[Kiss (band)|KISS]]. Miles\' work for the label included the album released under his own name, \'\'Bicentennial Gathering Of The Tribes\'\'. It would include on its liner notes a quote from President [[John F. Kennedy]] concerning the American Indians.<ref group="Note" "i">The quote from President John F Kennedy would include the line "When we neglect the heroic past of the American Indian, we thereby weaken our own heritage".</ref>

===1980s: The Club Fed Sessions===
In late 1984 and early 1985 while living in a halfway house in [[Oakland, California]], Miles commuted almost every single day to [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to collaborate with a handful of musicians and songwriters at the Ice House Studios in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]]. The list of collaborators included David Jenkins of [[Pablo Cruise]], Pat Craig and Dave Carlson with Tazmanian Devils, Robbie Long, Bill Craig, Tony Marty, and Tony Saunders. First recorded as a demo, the result was an album\'s worth of material. The project was soon moved to the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito]], where Jim Gaines of [[Huey Lewis and the News]] fame came in to take over production chores. 

The group produced over 15 songs ranging from funky, soulful grooves to R&B ballads. One cut, "When The Train Leaves the Station", featured solos by both [[Carlos Santana]] and [[Neal Schon]] from [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. "Anna", the title song of the proposed album, helped Miles land his next recording job with the [[California Raisins]]. However, during the album\'s production, the [[Record Plant]] was seized by the [[United States Government]] when its owner was indicted on drug trafficking charges. The musicians and employees working there began calling the studio "Club Fed"; hence the name "The Club Fed Sessions". Unfortunately, the album was never released, and the masters remain in the can, in the hands of Miles\' former manager. Years later, Pat Craig digitized some of the mixes and has been known to offer the album from time to time on [[eBay]] as a collector\'s item under the title \'\'Buddy and Me\'\'. The songs included on the tracklist were "Anna", "Forever in a Moment", "Tonight", "Next to You" and "This Could Be An Everlasting Love".

In 1986, Miles performed vocals for the "[[California Raisins]]" [[claymation]] ad campaign, most notably singing "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]", and also performed lead vocals on two California Raisins albums featuring 1960s R&B covers. In 1986 and 1987, he rejoined [[Carlos Santana]] as a vocalist on Santana\'s album \'\'Freedom\'\'. In 1987\xe2\x80\x931988, Miles moved to Southern California and formed the lineup of Marlo Henderson on guitar, [[Derek Sherinian]] on keyboards, and Michael BeHolden on bass. The band toured the California coast, then eventually did a tour of the [[Chitlin\' Circuit]] in the deep south before disbanding in early 1989.

===1990s: Tours and remembering Hendrix===
While residing in Chicago in 1990, Miles, along with guitarists [[Kevon Smith]] and Joe Thomas, formed MST. They recorded \'\'Hell and Back\'\' in 1994 and toured the U.S. and Europe until 1997. They were also featured in the DVD, \'\'Tribute to Jimi Hendrix - CAS\'\' (1997), directed by Patrick Savey.

From 1994 to 2007, Buddy Miles formulated his new version of the Buddy Miles Express in the New York City area, with Charlie Torres on bass guitar and vocals, Rod Kohn on guitar and vocals, the then-longest-standing Buddy Miles Express member and band leader [http://theorganplayer.org Mark "Muggie Doo" Leach] on Hammond B3, background vocals, and keyboards, and Kenn Moutenot on drums and vocals and handling management. They toured nearly nonstop in the United States and overseas, with nearly one thousand concerts and festivals to their credit.

In 1996, he sat in with rock band [[Phish]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. He also did several dates with Frank Damelio\'s NJ-based blues band, Rock\'n Daddy, which also included former TV Toy guitarist Bob "Big Bud" Solberg, drummer Paul "Fergy" Ferguson, and bassist Phil "Catfish" Endean, who, after developing arthritis in his left hand, now has an online music store at "http://www.endeanmusic.com". Endean, after one rehearsal, gave Miles one of his prized Fender Stratocaster guitars, which Miles played at times in their shows. Through the late 1990s, Miles\' band played pro bono at several annual tribute concerts for their local friend and fan, Linda Gillespie, who had been killed in a car accident in the spring of 1994 in Winthrop Harbor.

In 1997, Miles relocated to Fort Worth, Texas. Soon, he began collaborating with a young guitarist from Dallas named Lance Lopez. The former Band Of Gypsys legend would go on to mentor Lopez, co-producing Lopez\'s debut album, \'\'First Things First\'\', with Grammy-winning producer Jay Newland/[[Norah Jones]]. The Lopez album was released independently in 1999.

Miles was also seen in the Hendrix-family-owned official video release, \'\'The Making of Electric Ladyland\'\' on [[Rhino Records]]. The video featured interviews with the majority of players who were involved in recording the legendary Hendrix album. The video includes footage of Miles playing his drum tracks in the studio against the original multi-track recordings of Hendrix. In 1999, Miles performed on the late [[Bruce Cameron (guitarist)|Bruce Cameron]]\'s album, \'\'[[Midnight Daydream]]\'\', which included other Hendrix alumni Billy Cox, [[Mitch Mitchell]], [[Jack Bruce]], and others.

===2000s: Final albums and unreleased songs===
In 2000, Miles and Leach collaborated with Stevie Ray Vaugan\'s "Double Trouble" rhythm section, creating the Buddy Miles \'\'Blues Berries\'\' album which featured Rocky Athas of Black Oak Arkansas. This lineup also contributed a spirited version of Jimi Hendrix\'s "Wind Cries Mary" on the \'\'Blue Haze, Songs of Jimi Hendrix\'\' album in 2001. In addition, Miles also composed and recorded many songs with this new version of the Buddy Miles Express that are yet to be released. It was Miles\' most enduring live band. In fact, this touring lineup continued for six years with the same members.

The band continued on with Miles and Leach and a host of other players until Buddy\'s passing. The Miles/Leach duo, along with sax man Patrick Gage and bassist Dave Blackerby, also released the Buddy Miles Express\' final album, \'\'Road to Sturgis\'\', a benefit CD for the Children\'s Craniofacial Foundation. Miles and Leach continued writing new but unreleased music until just days before Miles\' passing.

In 2004, Miles reunited yet again with Billy Cox of the Band of Gypsys to re-record songs from the original 1970 live album with guitarists [[Eric Gales]], Kenny Olsen, [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], Andy Aledort and Gary Serkin. The album, titled \'\'The Band Of Gypsys Return\'\' was released in 2006. Until his death, Miles continued to be active musically and performed many shows with proceeds going to help support victims of natural disasters and other charitable causes.

Miles is credited on sessions with [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]/Parliament/Funkadelic.

In 2005, Miles began collaborating with Florida-based guitar virtuoso Tony Smotherman, and the two toured the Southeast with a blues-rock band performing various pieces from Miles\' collaborations with Jimi Hendrix. Miles and Smotherman last performed at the Austin Convention Center at the 2007 Summer NAMM Show with Vernon Reid of [[Living Colour]].

==Friendship and collaboration with Jimi Hendrix==
===Usage of past tracks===
After the Jimi Hendrix Experience split, Hendrix formed Gypsy Sun and Rainbows. The group disbanded in late September 1969 with nothing that was deemed releasable from their sessions. Nevertheless, they had recorded complete versions of "Message to Love" and "Machine Gun", songs which would be featured on the Band of Gypsys LP, as well as two other songs "Stepping Stone" and "Izabella" for the latter\'s singles. However, the track "Burning Desire" was never completed by both bands.

===Collaborations===
Between late September and mid-October 1969, Miles stated that: "Jimi was not happy. He felt powerless. He couldn\'t do what he wanted to do".<ref name="ReferenceA">Independent Buddy Miles obituary article Feb 29, 2008</ref> In response, in mid-October 1969, Hendrix founded a short-lived band called [[Band of Gypsys]], which Miles would join. [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]] and Stephan Bright were initially brought in to produce their recording sessions, but Cox immediately clashed with the pair, deeming them unworthy. Cox eventually stormed out of the sessions after a furious row with Bright and went home to Nashville for two weeks, before being coaxed back. At the end of Douglas and Bright\'s one-and-a-half months together, they had only produced one usable backing track, "Room Full of Mirrors". Consequently, Douglas and Bright resigned, stating pressures from the record label, Hendrix\'s manager Michael Jeffery, and Hendrix\'s own "lack of interest".

The same day Douglas resigned, Hendrix signed the contract with Bill Graham for the two dates at the Fillmore East. First, Hendrix had been talking about a Band of Gypsys "jam" LP since late 1968, after the settlement with Chalpin. He also introduced the band as both \'Gypsy Sun and Rainbows\' and \'Band of Gypsys\' during their Woodstock concert. At that time, the two Woodstock LPs were only credited as \'Jimi Hendrix\'.<ref group="Note" "ii"> One of the notable features of the band at the time was the fact that most of the players were black. The choice was also considered by some to be a move towards reconnecting with his soul roots, re-associating rock with its African-American roots.</ref> The recording of the Fillmore East concert was initially a single LP, but additional cuts from the concerts have been released on a double CD, \'\'Live at the Fillmore East\'\'. During the two-and-a-half months before the two nights\' worth of recordings for the LP, the band rehearsed and recorded in New York City.<ref group="Note" "iii"> The place that the band rehearsed and recorded was Hendrix and his management\'s apartment. It was also the place where he was building his Electric Lady studio.</ref> Hendrix was required to give his next LP to Ed Chalpin to be released by the [[Capitol Records]] label, but he had become entangled in litigation concerning the contract with Chalpin\'s PPX record company that he had signed, his agreement with Jeffery & Chandler prior to the contract, and becoming internationally recognized. This fact led to Miles and Billy Cox being hired as full-time employees for the duration of the three-month collaboration called the \'Band of Gypsys\'. In the end, the band produced the LP for Chalpin and Capitol, as well as a single for Reprise.

===Backing-up===
During a one-off charity event for the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] committee a month later, Hendrix had a minor meltdown on stage. Speculations include a possibly drug-related meltdown on stage, as well as an act of sabotage on the part of a very frustrated manager, Michael Jeffery. Jeffery was not a fan of the Band of Gypsys, which was claimed as fact by Miles. Miles had this to say about the incident years later, stating: "Jeffery slipped [Jimi] two half-tabs of acid on stage as he went on... [Jimi] just freaked out. I told Jeffery he was an out-and-out complete idiot... One of the biggest reasons why Jimi is dead is because of that guy."<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Miles and Jeffery already had a strained relationship eventually, as Jeffery was always uncomfortable with Hendrix\'s and Miles\' close friendship. After this one-off charity event at Madison Square Garden in January 1970, Jeffery told Miles that he was fired and the Band of Gypsys was no more. Although, Cox, and presumably Miles as well, had already been paid off as full-time salaried employees with a $1,000 bonus for their services the week before.

===\'\'Band of Gypsys\'\' album===
In addition to recording the live LP, studio recordings were made during the rehearsals leading up to the two concert dates and continued sporadically over a further three weeks. Cox\'s and Miles\'s recording for the single\'s A side was completed on the 7th, and the only other completed backing track was "Power of Soul" on the 21st. At this point, most of Hendrix\'s and [[Eddie Kramer]]\'s time was taken up with Hendrix\' overdubs and mixing of the studio tracks, as well as the beginning of the very long mixing and editing for the finished LP. Some of these songs were even marked down by Hendrix as contenders for his next LP. The songs include "Room Full of Mirrors", "Ezy Ryder", "Power of Soul", and the Band of Gypsys\' singles "Stepping Stone" and "Izabella", released a week after the LP, but back on Reprise records. The original version of "Stepping Stone" was later given new guitar overdubs as Miles\'s drums were replaced by Mitchell, and it was re-mixed by Hendrix with the intention of releasing it on his next LP. These songs have been released on several posthumous Hendrix albums. The album \'\'Band of Gypsys\'\' \xe2\x80\x94 released in March 1970 (US) and June 1970 (UK) \xe2\x80\x94 made the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic and stayed on the US charts for over a year. In addition, Hendrix\'s final extensive tour<ref group="Note" "iv">Hendrix had only played five major concerts \xe2\x80\x94 one morning and two nights \xe2\x80\x94 in the previous nine months since the original Experience broke up, not counting his last. Therefore, it was a two-song show only held at Madison Square Garden. All of these performances took place in New York City with the exception of Woodstock in upstate New York.</ref> and his tragic early death on September 18, 1970, caused the album to sell more copies and for a longer period of time. There are now videos of Miles and Randy Hansen covering several of Jimi\'s songs on a major website.

==Death and legacy==
At the age of 60, Buddy Miles died on February 26, 2008, at his home in Austin, Texas with his family by his side. According to his website, he died of congestive heart disease.

There was a history of congestive heart failure in his family. His sister and mother both died of the same illness.
It was known that his heart had certainly been struggling, working at only 15%, and his health had been consistently deteriorating over the previous few months. According to his friends, "...he had turned off his defibrillator and was ready for heaven."<ref>Cheech And Chong dot com, February 28, 2008</ref> There was no funeral as Miles was cremated.

The day before Buddy died, he heard Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton [[Live from Madison Square Garden (Eric Clapton & Steve Winwood album)|playing]] "Them Changes" at Madison Square Garden through his cell phone. "Them Changes" is now part of Clapton\'s set on tour as a tribute to Buddy. The UK-based newspaper \'\'[[The Independent]]\'\' ran an almost full-page obituary entitled "Buddy Miles: Flamboyant Hendrix drummer" in its Friday, February 29, 2008, edition.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/buddy-miles-flamboyant-hendrix-drummer-789321.html|title = Buddy Miles: Flamboyant Hendrix drummer|date = 29 Feb 2008|accessdate = 2014-06-25|website = The Independent|publisher = |last = Perrone|first = Pierre}}</ref>

Asked how he would like to be remembered by the American music magazine \'\'Seconds\'\' in 1995, Miles simply said: "The baddest of the bad. People say I\'m the baddest drummer. If that\'s true, thank you world."<ref>\'\'Seconds\'\' magazine, 1995</ref> A memorial concert took place on March 30, 2008 at [[Ren\xc3\xa9e O\'Connor|Threadgill\'s]] on Riverside Drive, South Austin.

\'\'\'Henry Roeland "Roy" Byrd\'\'\' (December 19, 1918 \xe2\x80\x93 January 30, 1980), better known as \'\'\'Professor Longhair\'\'\', was a [[New Orleans blues]] singer and pianist. Professor Longhair is noteworthy for having been active in two distinct periods, both in the heyday of early [[rhythm and blues]], and in the resurgence of interest in [[traditional jazz]] after the founding of the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]].

The music journalist Tony Russell, in his book \'\'The Blues&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 From [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] to [[Robert Cray]]\'\', stated "The vivacious [[rhumba]]-rhythmed piano blues and choked singing typical of Fess were too weird to sell millions of records; he had to be content with siring musical offspring who were simple enough to manage that, like [[Fats Domino]] or [[Huey "Piano" Smith]].  But he is also acknowledged as a father figure by subtler players like [[Allen Toussaint]] and [[Dr. John]]."<ref name="russell">{{cite book

==Biography==
[[File:Professor Longhair\'s House 2010.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Professor Longhair\'s House 2010]]

Professor Longhair was born on December 19, 1918 in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana]].<ref name="russell"/> His distinctive style was the result of learning to play piano on an instrument that was missing some keys.<ref name="russell"/>

He began his career in New Orleans in 1948. Mike Tessitore, owner of the Caldonia Club, gave Longhair his stage name.<ref name="AMG"/> Longhair first recorded in a band called the Shuffling Hungarians in 1949, creating four songs (including the first version of his signature song, "Mardi Gras in New Orleans") for the Star Talent record label. Union problems curtailed their release, but Longhair\'s next effort for [[Mercury Records]] the same year was a winner.<ref name="AMG"/>  Throughout the 1950s, he recorded for [[Atlantic Records]], [[Federal Records]] and other, local, labels.  Professor Longhair had only one national commercial hit, "Bald Head" in 1950, under the name Roy Byrd and His Blues Jumpers.<ref name="AMG"/> He also recorded his favorites, "Tipitina" and "Go to the Mardi Gras".<ref name="russell"/> However, he lacked [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] appeal for white audiences.<ref name="russell"/>

After suffering a stroke, Professor Longhair recorded "No Buts - No Maybes" in 1957.<ref name="AMG"/> He re-recorded "Go to the Mardi Gras" in 1959.<ref name="AMG"/>

He first recorded "[[Big Chief]]" with its composer [[Earl King]] in 1964. In the 1960s, Professor Longhair\'s career faltered.<ref name="russell"/> He became a janitor to support himself, and fell into a gambling habit.<ref name=recordedblues>{{cite book| last = Oliver (ed.)| first = Paul| title = The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Blues| publisher = Blackwell Publisher| year = 1989| location = Cambridge, MA| pages = 280\xe2\x80\x93281| isbn =0-631-18301-9 }}</ref>

He appeared at the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]] in 1971 and at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] and the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1973.<ref name="russell"/> His album \'\'The London Concert\'\' showcases work he did on a visit to the United Kingdom.

By the 1980s his albums, such as \'\'[[Crawfish Fiesta]]\'\' on [[Alligator Records|Alligator]] and \'\'[[New Orleans Piano]]\'\' for [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], had become readily available across America.<ref name="recordedblues"/> He appeared on the [[PBS]] series \'\'Soundstage\'\' (with Dr. John, Earl King, and [[The Meters]]) and co-starred in the film documentary \'\'Piano Players Rarely Ever Play Together\'\'.<ref name="AMG"/> Longhair died of a heart attack while filming was underway.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p99303/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Bill Dahl |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=May 28, 2009}}</ref><ref name=recordedblues>{{cite book| last = Oliver (ed.)| first = Paul| title = The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Blues| publisher = Blackwell Publisher

In 1981, he was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]]. He was awarded a posthumous [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for his early recordings released as \'\'House Party New Orleans Style,\'\' and in 1992 was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=10450|title=All About Jazz|work=All About Jazz|accessdate=January 19, 2015}}</ref>

The B side of the 1985 Paul McCartney single \'Spies Like Us\', entitled \'My Carnival\', credited to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]], was recorded in New Orleans and dedicated to Professor Longhair.

Fess\'s song "[[Tipitina]]" was covered by [[Hugh Laurie]] on the 2011 CD album "[[Let Them Talk]]". Laurie is a long-time fan, having used Fess\'s "Go to the Mardi Gras" as the theme for the pilot episode of [[A Bit of Fry & Laurie]].

==Afro-Cuban elements==
In the 1940s, Professor Longhair was playing with Caribbean musicians, listening a lot to [[Perez Prado]]\'s [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records, and absorbing and experimenting with it all.<ref>Palmer, Robert (1979: 14). \'\'A Tale of Two Cities: Memphis Rock and New Orleans Roll. Brooklyn.</ref> He was especially enamored with Cuban music. Longhair\'s style was known locally as \'\'rumba-boogie\'\'.<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 298). "Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music." \'\'Popular Music\'\', v. 19, n. 3. Oct. 2000, p.&nbsp;293\xe2\x80\x93318.</ref> Alexander Stewart states that Longhair was a key figure bridging the worlds of boogie-woogie and the new style of rhythm and blues."<ref>Stewart (2000: 297).</ref> In his composition "Misery," Professor Longhair plays a [[habanera (music)|habanera]]-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets in the right hand is a characteristic of Longhair\'s style.

[[File:Misery piano part professor longhair.jpg|thumb|center|430px|"Misery" by Professor Longhair (1957).]]

[[Tresillo (rhythm)|Tresillo]], the habanera, and related African-based single-[[cell (music)|celled]] figures have long been heard in the left hand part of piano compositions by New Orleans musicians, for example\xe2\x80\x94[[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]] ("Souvenirs From Havana" 1859), and [[Jelly Roll Morton]] ("The Crave" 1910). One of Longhair\'s great contributions was the adaptation of Afro-Cuban two-celled, [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]-based patterns in New Orleans blues. Michael Campbell states: "Rhythm and blues influenced by Afro-Cuban music first surfaced in New Orleans. Professor Longhair\'s influence was&nbsp;... far reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is \'Longhair\'s Blues Rhumba,\' where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm."<ref>Campbell, Michael, and James Brody (2007: 83). \'\'Rock and Roll: An Introduction\'\'. Schirmer. ISBN  0-534-64295-0</ref>  The [[guajeo]]-like piano part for the rumba-boogie "Mardi Gras in New Orleans" (1949), employs the [[clave (rhythm)|2-3 clave]] onbeat/offbeat motif.<ref>Kevin Moore: "There are two common ways that the three-side [of clave] is expressed in Cuban popular music. The first to come into regular use, which David Pe\xc3\xb1alosa calls \'clave motif,\' is based on the decorated version of the three-side of the clave rhythm. By the 1940s [there was] a trend toward the use of what Pe\xc3\xb1alosa calls the \'offbeat/onbeat motif.\' Today, the offbeat/onbeat motif method is much more common." Moore (2011). \'\'Understanding Clave and Clave Changes\'\' p. 32. Santa Cruz, CA: Moore Music/Timba.com. ISBN\xe2\x80\x9010: 1466462302</ref> The 2-3 clave time-line is written above the piano excerpt for reference.

[[File:Mardi gras in new orleans.tif|thumb|center|420px|Piano excerpt from the rumba boogie "Mardi Gras in New Orleans" (1949) by Professor Longhair. 2-3 clave is written above for rhythmic reference.]]

According to [[Dr. John]] (Malcolm John "Mac" Rebennack, Jr.), the Professor "put funk into music&nbsp;... Longhair\'s thing had a direct bearing I\'d say on a large portion of the funk music that evolved in New Orleans."<ref>Dr. John quoted by Stewart (2000: 297).</ref> This is the syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swung]] subdivisions). Alexander Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from "New Orleans\xe2\x80\x94through [[James Brown]]\'s music, to the popular music of the 1970s," adding: "The singular style of rhythm & blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of [[funk]]. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes.<ref>Stewart (2000: 293).</ref> Concerning funk motifs, Stewart states: "This model, it should be noted, is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle."<ref>Stewart (2000: 306).</ref>

\'\'\'William Everett "Billy" Preston\'\'\' (September 2, 1946&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 June 6, 2006)<ref name=nytobit /> was an American musician whose work included 
[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. A virtuoso keyboardist, particularly on [[Hammond organ]], Preston was recognized as a top session musician in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as [[Little Richard]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[the Beatles]].  He then went on to achieve fame as a solo artist, with hit pop singles including "[[That\'s the Way God Planned It (song)|That\'s the Way God Planned It]]", "[[Outa-Space]]", "[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]", "[[Space Race (instrumental)|Space Race]]", and "[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]".  In addition, Preston co-wrote "[[You Are So Beautiful]]", which became a number 5 hit for [[Joe Cocker]].  Preston continued to record and perform with other artists, notably [[George Harrison]] after the Beatles\' break-up, and [[Eric Clapton]], and he played keyboards for [[the Rolling Stones]] on many of the group\'s albums and tours during the 1970s.

Alongside [[Tony Sheridan]], Preston was the only other musician to be credited on a Beatles recording:  the artists on the number-one hit "[[Get Back]]" are given as "The Beatles with Billy Preston".  Since Sheridan was labeled alongside "The Beat Brothers", Preston is, strictly speaking, the only artist to be labeled explicitly with "The Beatles".  [[Stephen Stills]] asked Preston if he could use his phrase "if you can\'t be with the one you love, [[Love the One You\'re With|love the one you\'re with]]" and created the hit song.<ref>{{cite news|title=Song Stories: Love The One You\'re With|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/love-the-one-you-re-with-stephen-stills|accessdate=10 February 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Preston was born on September 2, 1946, in [[Houston, Texas]].  When he was three, the family moved to [[Los Angeles]], where Preston began playing piano while sitting on his mother Robbie\'s lap.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Noted as a [[child prodigy]], by the age of ten, Preston was playing organ onstage backing several gospel singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[James Cleveland]] and [[Andra\xc3\xa9 Crouch]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} At age eleven, Preston appeared on Cole\'s national TV show singing the [[Fats Domino]] hit, "[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]". At twelve, he appeared in the [[W.C. Handy]] biopic starring [[Nat King Cole]]: \'\'[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]\'\' (1958), playing W.C. Handy at a younger age.

In 1962, Preston joined [[Little Richard]]\'s band as an organist, and it was while performing in [[Hamburg]] that Preston met The Beatles. In 1963, he played the organ on [[Sam Cooke]]\'s \'\'[[Night Beat (album)|Night Beat]]\'\' album. that year, he also released his own debut album, \'\'16 Yr Old Soul\'\', for Cooke\'s [[SAR Records]] label.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news-releases.theurbanmusicscene.com/2011/02/11/billy-prestons-16-year-old-soul-to-be-re.aspx |work=The Urban Music Scene|title=Billy Preston\'s \'\'16-Year-Old Sould to be Digitally re-re-released on February 22, 2011}} "\'\'16 Year Old Soul\'\' is an album of percolating organ-infused instrumentals that offers insight into the roots of one of the music world\'s most innovative and genre-busting stars who died at the age of 59, in 2006. With songs covering a broad spectrum of styles from country (\'Born to Loose\') to R&B (\'Good News\') to jazz (\'God Bless The Child\') with pop and blues undertones aplenty, \'\'16 Year Old Soul\'\' is a preserved-in-amber glimpse of an artist whose musical maturity belied his years."</ref> In 1965, he released the album \'\'[[The Most Exciting Organ Ever]]\'\', and that same year performed on the rock and roll show \'\'[[Shindig!]]\'\' In 1967, he joined [[Ray Charles]]\' band. Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Relationship with the Beatles==
Preston first met [[the Beatles]] as a 16-year-old in 1962, while part of Little Richard\'s touring band, when their manager [[Brian Epstein]] organized a Liverpool show, at which the Beatles opened. The \'\'[[Washington Post]]\'\' explained their subsequent meeting:
{{cquote|They\'d hook up again in 1969, when the Beatles were about to break up while recording the last album they released, \'\'[[Let It Be]]\'\' (they would later record \'\'[[Abbey Road]]\'\', which was released prior to \'\'Let It Be\'\'). [[George Harrison]], a friend of Preston, had quit, walked out of the studio and gone to a Ray Charles concert in [[London]], where Preston was playing organ. Harrison brought Preston back to the studio, where his keen musicianship and gregarious personality temporarily calmed the tension.<ref name="WP Obit">{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Harrington|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=\'Fifth Beatle\' Billy Preston Made the Greats Even Greater |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702166.html |quote= |publisher=Washington Post |date=June 8, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>}}

Preston is one of several people referred to by commentators as the "[[Fifth Beatle]]". At one point during the "[[Get Back]]" sessions, [[John Lennon]] proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which [[Paul McCartney]] countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four).<ref>The Beatles - A/B Road: The Complete Get back Sessions, January 24th</ref> Preston played with the Beatles for several of the \'\'Get Back\'\' sessions, some of the material from which would later be culled to make the film \'\'[[Let It Be (film)|Let it Be]]\'\' and its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band for [[The Beatles\' rooftop concert|its rooftop concert]]; the group\'s final public appearance.<ref name="WP Obit"/> In April 1969, their single "Get Back" was credited to "The Beatles with Billy Preston", the only time such a joint credit had been given on an official Beatles-sanctioned release (as distinct from an unsanctioned reissue of some Hamburg-era recordings on which they were the backing group for [[Tony Sheridan]]). The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston\'s presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the \'\'Abbey Road\'\' album, contributing to the tracks "[[I Want You (She\'s So Heavy)]]" and "[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]."

In 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in [[Robert Stigwood]]\'s film \'\'[[Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band]]\'\', which was very loosely based on the Beatles\' [[Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], and sang "Get Back" as the penultimate song.

==Post-Beatles solo career==
[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Preston singing at the piano in 1971]]
Signed to the Beatles\' [[Apple Records]] label, in 1969, Preston released the album \'\'[[That\'s the Way God Planned It]]\'\', produced by Harrison, the [[That\'s the Way God Planned It|title song from which]] was a hit single in Britain. His relationship with Harrison continued after the Beatles\' break-up in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison\'s subsequent international hit "[[My Sweet Lord]]", on his 1970 album \'\'[[Encouraging Words]]\'\', which Harrison co-produced with Preston. He appeared on several of Harrison\'s 1970s solo albums, starting with \'\'[[All Things Must Pass]]\'\'; made a notable contribution to [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of [[North America]]; and played at the 2002 [[Concert for George]] tribute, held at London\'s [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Preston also worked on solo releases by Lennon and [[Ringo Starr]].

In 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with [[Herb Alpert]]\'s [[A&M Records]]. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when [[Stephen Stills]] asked to use Preston\'s phrase "if you can\'t be with the one you love, [[Love the One You\'re With|love the one you\'re with]]", a song on Stills\' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled]] debut solo album.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

Following the release of \'\'[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]\'\' on A&M, Preston\'s solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972\'s "[[Outa-Space]]", an [[instrumental]] track that further popularized the sound of the [[clavinet]] in [[funk]] music. The song reached number 2 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and topped \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\'{{\'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, before going on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. "Outa-Space" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in June 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Over the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles "[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]" and "[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing From Nothing]]", and the number 4 hit "Space Race". Each of the three singles sold in excess of 1 million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> \'\'[[American Bandstand]]\'\' host and executive producer [[Dick Clark]] enjoyed "Space Race" so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Rolling Stines 1975 Bily Preston Nicky Hopkins.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Preston supporting [[The Rolling Stones]] on their [[The Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas \'75|Tour of the Americas]], July 23, 1975]]
From 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet and various synthesizers) for [[the Rolling Stones]], sometimes alongside pianists [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], on their albums \'\'[[Sticky Fingers]]\'\', \'\'[[Exile on Main Street]]\'\', \'\'[[Goats Head Soup]]\'\', \'\'[[It\'s Only Rock\'n Roll]]\'\' and \'\'[[Black and Blue]]\'\'. As the band\'s primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he also performed as a support act with his own band (including [[Mick Taylor]] on guitar) on their [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European Tour]]. A [[Munich]] performance was documented in the live album \'\'[[Live European Tour 1973]]\'\'. In 1974, along with Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, he composed one of Joe Cocker\'s biggest hits, "You Are So Beautiful". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\'{{\'}}s series premiere episode (along with [[Janis Ian]]). Preston\'s 1973 song "Do You Love Me" was the basis for the Rolling Stones\' track "Melody", released on \'\'Black and Blue\'\' in 1976.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Although two of his songs ("Nothing from Nothing" and "Outa-Space") were included in the band\'s 1976 live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} He continued to play on solo records by Stones members and made appearances on the band\'s 1981 \'\'[[Tattoo You]]\'\' and 1997 \'\'[[Bridges to Babylon]]\'\' albums.

Preston\'s solo career began to decline after 1976. After five years with A&M, he signed with [[Motown Records]]. In 1980, he duetted with [[Syreeta Wright]] on the ballad "[[With You I\'m Born Again]]", which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Failing thereafter to match its success, Preston left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work. He served as musical director for \'\'[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]\'\', a late-night [[talk show]] hosted by [[David Brenner]] that lasted one season from 1986 &ndash; 1987.<ref name="Chase">

==Legal troubles==
In 1991, Preston was arrested and convicted for [[insurance fraud]] after setting fire to his own house in Los Angeles,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07iht-web.0607preston.1906957.html?_r=0 Jon Pareles, "Obituary: Billy Preston, 59, renowned keyboardist - International Herald Tribune".]</ref> and he was treated for [[alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] addictions. He also was arrested in 1991 for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old Mexican boy, after picking him up at a gathering point for day laborers.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-19/local/me-736_1_singer-billy-preston Edward J. Boyer, "Singer Billy Preston Arrested in Sex Case"], \'\'Los Angeles Times\'\', August 19, 1991.</ref> After submitting to a drug test, he tested positive for cocaine. That year, he entered [[nolo contendre|no-contest pleas]] to the cocaine and [[sexual assault]] charges. He was sentenced to nine months at a [[drug rehabilitation]] center and three months of [[house arrest]].

Preston overcame his problems in the early 1990s, toured with [[Eric Clapton]], recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists. He also toured with [[Ringo Starr]] and appeared on the 1990 live album \'\'[[Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band]]\'\'. He was invited to become a member of [[The Band]] in 1991, after the death of piano player [[Stan Szelest]]. He performed on tour with the group, but the sentencing from his cocaine and sexual assault charges ended the collaboration.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Later work==
In 1997, Billy Preston recorded the album \'\'You and I\'\', in Italy, with Italian band [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]]. The album was produced by Vaughn De Spenza and Novecento members [[Nicolosi Productions|Lino and Pino Nicolosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/novecentomusic-wolit/collaboration/collaboration.htm |title=Collaborations - Novecento and Billy Preston |publisher=Web.tiscali.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

In 1998, Preston played organ during the choir numbers on the [[UPN]] comedy show \'\'[[Good News (TV series)|Good News]]\'\'. The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film \'\'[[Blues Brothers 2000]]\'\', as part of the super group, [[The Louisiana Gator Boys]].

While touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that on November 29, 2001, [[George Harrison]] had died (having long suffered from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]). Preston, among many of Harrison\'s longtime friends, performed in the 2002 [[Concert for George]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London, England|London]]. Preston\'s performance of "[[My Sweet Lord]]" received critical acclaim.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Additionally, Preston sang "[[Isn\'t It a Pity]]", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the [[Hammond organ]] for the show. [[Ringo Starr]] called him one of the greatest Hammond players of all time (in the theatrical version of the concert).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2002, Preston appeared on the [[Johnny Cash]] album \'\'[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]\'\', playing piano on "[[Personal Jesus]]" and "[[Tear-Stained Letter]]".

In 2004, Preston toured with the [[Funk Brothers]] and [[Steve Winwood]] in Europe, and then with his friend [[Eric Clapton]] in Europe and North America. After he finished touring with Clapton, Preston went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the \'\'[[Legends Rock]] TV Show.\'\'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legends-rock.com/index.php/episodes/billy-preston |title=Guest Artist of the Legends Rock TV Show |publisher=Legends-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> His performance included a duet with [[Samuel David Moore|Sam Moore]] singing "[[You Are So Beautiful]]"; this was Preston\'s last videotaped concert.

In 2004, Preston performed as a [[List of jazz organists|jazz organist]] on Ray Charles\' \'\'[[Genius Loves Company]]\'\', an album of duets, on the song "[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]" with Charles and [[Norah Jones]].

In March 2005, Preston appeared on the \'\'[[American Idol]]\'\' [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] finale. Playing piano, he performed "[[With You I\'m Born Again]]" with [[Vonzell Solomon]] (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded "Go Where No One\'s Gone Before", the main title song for the [[anime]] series \'\'[[L/R: Licensed by Royalty]]\'\'.

Preston played [[clavinet]] on the song "[[Warlocks (song)|Warlocks]]" for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] album \'\'[[Stadium Arcadium]]\'\' (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/peppers%20get%20sick%20preston%20out%20of%20bed_14_03_2006 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Peppers Get Sick Preston Out Of Bed |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>

Preston\'s final recorded contributions were the [[Gospel music|gospel]]-tinged organ on the [[Neil Diamond]] album \'\'[[12 Songs (Neil Diamond album)|12 Songs]]\'\' (2005), and his keyboard work on \'\'[[The Road to Escondido]]\'\' (2006) by [[Eric Clapton]] and [[J. J. Cale]].

In late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to support the re-release of the \'\'[[Concert for Bangla Desh]]\'\' (1972) movie. Preston played a three song set of "[[Give Me Love]]", "[[My Sweet Lord]]", and "[[Isn\'t It a Pity]]", and was supported by [[Dhani Harrison]] on guitar and [[Ringo Starr]] on drums (for "Isn\'t It a Pity", only).

==Personal life==
Preston was [[openly gay]] but did not speak publicly about his sexuality.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Life (book)|Life]]|author=Richards, Keith|authorlink=Keith Richards|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-297-85439-5|quote=And he was gay at a time when nobody could be openly gay, which added difficulties to his life.

Jazz musician [[Miles Davis]] was heavily influenced by Preston\'s music during his [[funk rock]] period of the early 1970s.{{who|date=December 2013}}{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Davis\' album \'\'[[Get Up With It]]\'\' (1974) features a track called "Billy Preston" in his honor.

==Death==
{{Wikinews|Billy Preston dies at 59}}
Preston had battled [[kidney disease]] in his later years, brought on by his [[hypertension]]. He received a kidney transplant in 2002, but his health continued to deteriorate. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in [[Malibu, California]], at the suggestion of guitarist Is\'real Benton, and suffered [[pericarditis]] there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma from November 21, 2005.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |first= Jon|last= Pareles|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07preston.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all |quote=Billy Preston, the splashy gospel-rooted keyboardist whose career included No. 1 solo hits and work with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died yesterday in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Lo\'\'\', is an American actress, author, fashion designer, dancer, producer, and singer. She became interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry following a minor role in the 1986 film \'\'[[My Little Girl]]\'\', to the dismay of her [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parents, who believed that it was an unrealistic career route for a Hispanic. Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a [[Fly Girl]] dancer on \'\'[[In Living Color]]\'\' in 1991, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. She received her first leading role in the [[Selena]] biopic [[Selena (film)|of the same name]] in 1997. Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn over $1 million for a role the following year, with the film \'\'[[Out of Sight]]\'\'. She ventured into the music industry in 1999 with her debut studio album, \'\'[[On the 6]]\'\'.

With the simultaneous release of her second studio album \'\'[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]\'\' and her film \'\'[[The Wedding Planner]]\'\' in 2001, Lopez became the first person to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, \'\'[[J to tha L\xe2\x80\x93O! The Remixes]]\'\', became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], while her fifth studio album, \'\'[[Como Ama una Mujer]]\'\' (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a Spanish album in the United States. With past record sales of over 60 million and a cumulative film gross of over $2 billion, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, as well as its highest paid Latin entertainer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jennifer Lopez|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/jennifer-lopez/|website=\'\'[[MTV]]\'\'|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="hhh" /> Along with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] and [[Claudia Leitte]], she recorded "[[We Are One (Ole Ola)]]", which served as the [[FIFA World Cup official songs|official song]] of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cantor-Navas|first=Judy|title=Pitbull\'s \'We Are One (Ole, Ola)\' Featuring Jennifer Lopez, Claudia Leitte Named FIFA\'S Official World Cup Song|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/5884960/pitbulls-we-are-one-ole-ola-featuring-jennifer-lopez-claudia-leitte|work=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=April 6, 2014|date=January 23, 2014}}</ref>

Beyond entertainment, Lopez enjoyed a highly successful business career, consisting of various clothing lines, accessories, fragrances, [[Nuyorican Productions|a production company]], television shows and a [[Lopez Family Foundation|charitable foundation]] among other business interests. Lopez\'s personal relationships have attracted worldwide media attention; she has been married three times. Following the breakdown of her first marriage, Lopez dated rapper and entertainment mogul [[Sean Combs]]. Following the breakdown of her second marriage to husband [[Cris Judd]], she dated actor [[Ben Affleck]]. Their relationship was the subject of much media interest; their planned wedding was cancelled four days before the ceremony. Lopez then wed longtime friend [[Marc Anthony]]; they separated after seven years of marriage. Lopez gave birth to their twins, Emme and Maximilian, in 2008.

==Early life==
Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in the [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]] neighborhood of [[The Bronx]], [[New York]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209202541/http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archivedate=February 9, 2008|title=Duty Captain\'s Report|accessdate=October 29, 2006|work=[[Court TV]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=January 17, 2001}}</ref> to [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parents Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez. She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, [[Lynda Lopez|Lynda]], a journalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com/musica/fotos/mamas_y_mamacitas/64457 |title=Mam\xc3\xa1s y Mamacitas&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 M\xc3\xbasica |publisher=[[Terra Networks]] |accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=May 11, 2007}}</ref> David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company, before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.<ref name="Gallick2003">{{harvnb|Gallick|2003}}</ref> At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home; singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay "out of trouble".<ref name="atriplethreat">{{cite web|url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/619/The-Triple-Threat-Jennifer-Lopez-is-Born.html |title=The Triple Threat: Jennifer Lopez is Born |publisher=Evan Carmichael |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]].<ref name=tca>Stated on \'\'[[Inside the Actors Studio]]\'\', 2004</ref> In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level and was a member of the school\'s softball team.<ref name=rantrack>{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James-Robert|title=Jennifer Lopez: Actor and Singer|page=14|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lh1Y2OK-VdsC&pg=PA129&dq=J-Lo:+The+Secret+Behind+Jennifer+Lopez\'s+Clib+to+the+Top#v=onepage&q=J-Lo%3A%20The%20Secret%20Behind%20Jennifer%20Lopez\'s%20Clib%20to%20the%20Top&f=false|isbn=978-0-8160-5832-7|date=November 30, 2005}}</ref> She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.<ref name=atriplethreat /> In 1984, at the age of fifteen, she began dating David Cruz, her first boyfriend.<ref name="Gallick2003"/>

While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in \'\'[[My Little Girl]]\'\' (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.<ref name="Rovi My Little Girl">{{cite web|first=Eleanor |last=Mannikka |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/my-little-girl-v34075|title=My Little Girl&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011}}</ref> Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a "famous movie star". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in [[Baruch College]], only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a "really stupid" idea and that "no Latinos did that". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in [[Manhattan]]. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals: \'\'Jesus Christ Superstar\'\' and \'\'Oklahoma\'\'. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a \'\'Golden Musicals of Broadway\'\', which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus to not have a solo. She later got a job on the show \'\'Synchronicity\'\' in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer.<ref name="Gallick2003"/>

==Career==

===1991\xe2\x80\x9396: \'\'In Living Color\'\' and early film career===
Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the [[New Kids on the Block]] in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of "[[Games (New Kids on the Block song)|Games]]" at the [[American Music Awards of 1991|18th Annual American Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perricon|first=Kathleen|title=Jennifer Lopez dances with New Kids on the Block in 1991 video clip|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-10/entertainment/29547058_1_nkotb-music-video-new-kids|journal=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=June 22, 2012|date=May 10, 2011}}</ref> Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a [[Fly Girl]] dancer on the television program \'\'[[In Living Color]]\'\'. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unavailable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up, but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved with Cruz to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Morales|first=Ed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/30/entertainment/ca-42339|title=It\'s Not La Vida Loca to Her|accessdate=January 30, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=May 30, 1999}}</ref> Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her [[Janet World Tour]] in late 1993, but backed out as she wanted to do her "own thing."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Living Single|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gCYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA100&dq=This+Is+Me...+Then+jennifer+lopez+million+copies&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s03xT_70N8z3rAG1hqG1Cg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=This%20Is%20Me...%20Then%20jennifer%20lopez%20million%20copies&f=false|journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=[[InterMedia Partners]]|accessdate=July 6, 2012|page=100|date=May 2001}}</ref>

Over the course of her career, Lopez\'s music has covered a wide range of genres including Latin pop, dance, R&B, hip hop, rock, funk, house and salsa. According to author Ed Morales, her music explores both the "romantic innocence of Latin music" and hip hop.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morales|first=Ed|title=The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond|year=2003|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=078673020X|page=163}}</ref> While heavily influenced by Latin musical styles ranging from [[salsa (music)|salsa]] to [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], it was the 1979 hip hop song "[[Rapper\'s Delight]]" by hip hop trio [[The Sugarhill Gang]] that inspired her career. On her first album \'\'On the 6\'\' (1999), Lopez fused Latin music together with the hip hop sound she loved, which she described as being [[Latin soul]].<ref name="Woog08">{{harvnb|Woog|2008}}</ref>

\'\'\'Prince Roger Nelson\'\'\' (born June 7, 1958), known by his [[Mononymous person|mononym]] \'\'\'Prince\'\'\', is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor. A major figure in popular music for over three decades, Prince is renowned as an innovator and is widely-known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence and wide [[vocal range]]. Widely regarded as the pioneer of [[Minneapolis sound]], Prince\'s music combines [[rock music|rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[disco]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[jazz]], and [[pop music|pop]].

Born in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], Prince developed an interest in music at an early age, writing his first song at age seven. After recording songs with his cousin\'s band [[94 East]], 19-year-old Prince recorded several unsuccessful demo tapes before releasing his debut album, \'\'[[For You (Prince album)|For You]]\'\', in 1978 under the guidance of Manager Owen Husney. His 1979 album, \'\'[[Prince (album)|Prince]]\'\', went platinum due to the success of the singles "[[Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?]]" and "[[I Wanna Be Your Lover]]". His next three records, \'\'[[Dirty Mind]]\'\' (1980), \'\'[[Controversy (Prince album)|Controversy]]\'\' (1981) and \'\'[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]\'\' (1982), continued his success, showcasing Prince\'s trademark of prominently sexual lyrics and incorporation of elements of funk, dance and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as the [[The Revolution (band)|Revolution]] and released \'\'[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]\'\', which served as the soundtrack to his [[Purple Rain (film)|film debut of the same name]].

After releasing the albums \'\'[[Around the World in a Day]]\'\' (1985) and \'\'[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]\'\' (1986), The Revolution disbanded and Prince released the critically acclaimed double album \'\'[[Sign "O" the Times]]\'\' (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting [[The New Power Generation]] band in 1991. After changing his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol ([[File:Prince logo.svg|13px]]), also known as the "Love Symbol", in 1993, he began releasing new albums at a faster pace to remove himself from contractual obligations to Warner Bros; he released five records between 1994 and 1996 before signing with [[Arista Records]] in 1998. In 2000, he began referring to himself as "Prince" once again. He has released fourteen albums since then, including his latest, \'\'[[Art Official Age]]\'\', released on September 30, 2014.

Prince has sold over 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2011/apr/12/prince-brings-early-valentines-day-gift-to-nyc/|title=Prince brings early Valentine\'s Day gift to NYC|first=|last=Misani|publisher=\'\'[[New York Amsterdam News]]\'\'|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}</ref> He has won seven [[Grammy Award]]s<ref>{{cite web| title = Grammy search database|publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | url = http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/| accessdate =February 27, 2010}}</ref> a [[Golden Globe]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Golden Globe Awards| work=goldenglobes.org| url = http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/26062| accessdate =February 27, 2010}}</ref> and an [[Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Nominees & Winners for the 57th Academy Awards|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences| url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/1980-1989/57nominees.html| accessdate =February 27, 2010}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2004, the first year of his eligibility.<ref>{{cite web| title = Tavis Smiley| work=pbs.org| date = April 27, 2009| url = http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200904/20090427.html}}</ref> \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' has ranked Prince at number 27 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref name="rollingstone2004">{{cite web|last= Thompson |first= Ahmir |title=100 Greatest Artists |work=Rolling Stone| date = March 24, 2004| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/prince-20110419}}</ref>

==Early life==
Prince was born in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], the son of Mattie Della (Shaw) and [[John L.

Retrieved February 11, 2007.</ref> Prince\'s father was a pianist and songwriter and his mother was a [[jazz]] singer. Prince was named after his father, whose [[stage name]] was Prince Rogers, and who performed with a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In a 1991 interview with \'\'[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]\'\', Prince\'s father said that "I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do".{{sfn|Hahn|2004}} Prince\'s childhood nickname was Skipper.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gulla|first=Bob|title= Icons of R&B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists who Revolutionized Rhythm|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing]]|year=2008|page= 483|isbn=0-313-34046-3}}</ref>

In a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview, Prince told [[Tavis Smiley]] that he was "born [[epilepsy|epileptic]]" and "used to have seizures" when he was young. During the interview, he also said: "My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, \'Mom, I\'m not going to be sick anymore,\' and she said, \'Why?\' and I said, \'Because an angel told me so\'."<ref>{{cite web| last = Lynch| first = Jason | title = Prince Talks about His Struggle with Epilepsy|work=People | date = April 28, 2009| url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20275184,00.html}}</ref>

Prince and Anderson joined Prince\'s cousin, Charles Smith, in a band called Grand Central while they were attending Minneapolis\'s Central High School. Smith was later replaced by [[Morris Day]] on the drums. Prince played piano and guitar for the band which performed at clubs and parties in the Minneapolis area. Grand Central later changed its name to Champagne and started playing original music influenced by Sly & the Family Stone, James Brown, [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], Miles Davis, Parliament-Funkadelic, Carlos Santana, Jimi Hendrix, and [[Todd Rundgren]].{{sfn|Myers|2010|p = 17}} Prince also played basketball in high school.<ref>{{cite web| last = Tevlin| first = Jon | title = The quiet one: A high school classmate recalls the Artist as a young man | work=Minneapolis Star Tribune| date = March 13, 2004| url = http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/11527586.html}}</ref>

==Career==

===1975\xe2\x80\x9384: Beginnings and breakthrough===
In 1975, Pepe Willie, the husband of Prince\'s cousin, Shauntel, formed the band [[94 East]] with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry. Willie hired Andr\xc3\xa9 Cymone and Prince to record tracks with 94 East. Those songs were written by Willie and Prince contributed guitar tracks. Prince also co-wrote, with Willie, the 94 East song, "Just Another Sucker". The band recorded tracks which later became the album \'\'Minneapolis Genius&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 The Historic 1977 Recordings\'\'. Prince also recorded, but never released, a song written by Willie, "If You See Me" (also known as, "Do Yourself a Favor"). In 1995, Willie released the album \'\'94 East featuring Prince, Symbolic Beginning\'\', which included original recordings by Prince and Cymone.

In 1976, Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in Moon\'s Minneapolis studio. Unable to secure a recording contract, Moon brought the tape to Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman. Husney signed Prince, at the age of 17, to a management contract and helped Prince create a demo recording at [[Sound 80]] Studios in Minneapolis using producer/engineer David Z. The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney\'s ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[A&M Records]], and [[Columbia Records]].

With the help of Husney, Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros.. The record company agreed to give Prince creative control for three albums and ownership of the publishing rights.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Husney and Prince then left Minneapolis and moved to [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]], California where Prince\'s first album, \'\'[[For You (Prince album)|For You]]\'\', was recorded at [[Record Plant Studios]]. Subsequently, the album was mixed in Los Angeles and released in on April 7, 1978.<ref>Uptown, 2004, p. 19</ref> According to the \'\'For You\'\' album notes, Prince produced, arranged, composed and played all 27 instruments on the recording. The album was written and performed by Prince, except for the song "[[Soft and Wet]]" which had lyrics co-written by Moon. The cost of recording the album was twice Prince\'s initial advance. Prince used the \'\'Prince\'s Music Co.\'\' to [[music publisher (popular music)|publish]] his songs. "Soft and Wet" reached No. 12 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart and No. 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. The song "[[Just as Long as We\'re Together]]" reached No. 91 on the Hot Soul Singles chart.

[[File:Ticket to Prince\xe2\x80\x99s First Concert.jpg|thumb|right|Ticket to Prince\'s first performance with his band in January 1979]]
In 1979, Prince created a band that included Andr\xc3\xa9 Cymone on bass, [[Dez Dickerson]] on guitar, Gayle Chapman and [[Doctor Fink]] on keyboards, and [[Bobby Z.]] on drums. Their first show was at the Capri Theater on January 5, 1979. Warner Bros. executives attended the show but decided that Prince and the band needed more time to develop his music.<ref>Dave Hill, \'\'Prince: A Pop Life\'\', London: Faber and Faber, 1989.</ref> In October 1979, Prince released a self-titled album, \'\'[[Prince (album)|Prince]]\'\', which was No. 4 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B/Black Albums]] charts, and No. 22 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], going platinum. It contained two R&B hits: "[[Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?]]" and "[[I Wanna Be Your Lover]]". "I Wanna Be Your Lover" sold over a million copies, and reached No. 11 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100, and No. 1 for two weeks on the Hot Soul Singles chart. Prince performed both these songs on January 26, 1980, on \'\'[[American Bandstand]]\'\'. On this album, Prince used \'\'Ecnirp Music&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/publisher.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=99813&keyname=ECNIRP%20MUSIC&querytype=PubID |title=BMI &#124; Repertoire Search |publisher=Repertoire.bmi.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

In 1980, Prince released the album, \'\'[[Dirty Mind]]\'\', which he recorded in his own studio. The album was certified gold and the attendant single "[[Uptown (song)|Uptown]]" reached No. 5 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Dance chart and No. 5 on the Hot Soul Singles charts. Prince was also the opening act for [[Rick James]]\' 1980 \'\'Fire It Up\'\' tour. \'\'Dirty Mind\'\' contained sexually explicit material, including the title song, "[[Head (Prince song)|Head]]", and the song "Sister". In February 1981, Prince made his first appearance on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\', performing "Partyup". In October 1981, Prince released the album, \'\'[[Controversy (Prince album)|Controversy]]\'\'. He played several dates in support of it, at first as one of the opening acts for the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], who were then on tour in the US. He began 1982 with a small tour of college towns where he was the headlining act. The songs on \'\'Controversy\'\' were published by \'\'Controversy Music\'\'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |title=Profile for Controversy Music |publisher=Ascap.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'\'[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]\'\', a practice he continued until the \'\'[[Emancipation (Prince album)|Emancipation]]\'\' album in 1996.
\'\'Controversy\'\' also marked the introduction of Prince\'s use of abbreviated spelling, such as spelling the words \'\'you\'\' as \'\'U\'\', \'\'to\'\' as \'\'2\'\', and \'\'for\'\' as \'\'4\'\', as indicated by the inclusion of the track "Jack U Off". (His earlier song titles had used conventional spelling.)<ref>Examples include the album \'\'For You\'\' and its title track; "[[I Feel for You]]" on \'\'Prince\'\'; and "[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]" from \'\'Dirty Mind\'\'.</ref> By 2002, MTV.com noted that "[n]ow all of his titles, liner notes and Web postings are written in his own shorthand spelling, as seen on 1999\'s \'\'Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\'\', which featured \'Hot Wit U.\'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458662/y-kant-artists-spell.jhtml|title=Y Kant Artists Spell?

In 1981, Prince formed a side project band called the [[The Time (band)|Time]]. The band released four albums between 1981 and 1990, with Prince writing and performing most of the instrumentation and backing vocals, with lead vocals by [[Morris Day]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
In late 1982, Prince released a double album, \'\'[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]\'\', which sold over three million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/1999/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/20/wb.prince.bio/ |title=CNN&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 World Beat Biography&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Prince&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 December 20, 1999 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> The [[1999 (song)|title track]] was a protest against [[nuclear proliferation]] and became his first top ten hit in countries outside the US.

The song "[[Delirious (Prince song)|Delirious]]" also placed in the top ten on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 chart.

===1984\xe2\x80\x9387: The Revolution, \'\'Purple Rain\'\' and subsequent releases===
During this period Prince referred to his band as the [[The Revolution (band)|Revolution]]. The band\'s name was also printed, in reverse, on the cover of \'\'1999\'\' inside the letter "I" of the word "Prince". The band consisted of [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]] and Doctor Fink on keyboards, Bobby Z. on drums, [[Brownmark|Brown Mark]] on bass, and Dez Dickerson on guitar. Jill Jones, a backing singer, was also part of The Revolution line up for the \'\'1999\'\' album and tour. Following the [[1999 Tour]], Dickerson left the group for religious reasons. In the 2003 book \'\'Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince\'\', author Alex Hahn says that Dickerson was reluctant to sign a three-year contract and wanted to pursue other musical ventures. Dickerson was replaced by [[Wendy Melvoin]], a childhood friend of Coleman. At first the band was used sparsely in the studio but this gradually changed during the mid-1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Prince\'s 1984 album \'\'[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]\'\' sold more than 13 million copies in the US and spent 24 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 chart. The [[Purple Rain (film)|film of the same name]] won an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Academy Award]] and grossed more than $80&nbsp;million in the US.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum| url = http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/prince| accessdate =February 27, 2010}}</ref>
[[File:Prince Brussels 1986.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prince performing in Brussels during the [[Hit N Run - Parade Tour|Hit N Run Tour]] in 1986]]
Songs from the film were hits on pop charts around the world, while "[[When Doves Cry]]" and "[[Let\'s Go Crazy]]" reached No. 1 and the [[Purple Rain (song)|title track]] reached No. 2 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100. At one point in 1984, Prince simultaneously had the No. 1 album, single, and film in the US; it was the first time a singer had achieved this feat.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Gulla | first = Bob |title = Icons of R&B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists who Revolutionized Rhythm| publisher=Greenwood Press| year = 2008| page = 419| url = | id = | isbn = 0-313-34044-7}}</ref> Prince won the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Original Song Score]] for \'\'Purple Rain\'\', and the album is ranked 72nd \'\'Rolling Stone\'\'\'s [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref name="RollingStone">"The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", November 18, 2003, at [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time RollingStone.com].

In 1985, Prince announced that he would discontinue live performances and music videos after the release of his next album. His subsequent recording \'\'[[Around the World in a Day]]\'\' held the No. 1 spot on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 for three weeks.
In 1986 his album \'\'[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]\'\' reached No. 3 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 and No. 2 on the R&B charts. The first single, "[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]", with the video choreographed by [[Louis Falco]], reached No. 1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100. The song was originally written for a side project called [[Mazarati]]. That same year the song "[[Manic Monday]]", which was written by Prince and recorded by The Bangles, reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart. The album \'\'Parade\'\' served as the soundtrack for Prince\'s second film, \'\'[[Under the Cherry Moon]]\'\'. Prince directed and starred in the movie, which also featured [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]. He received the [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for his efforts in acting and directing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factacular.com/topic.php?topicid=32297 |title=Golden Raspberry Award Winners |publisher=Factacular |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref>

In 1986, Prince began a series of sporadic live performances called the [[Hit n Run \xe2\x80\x93 Parade Tour]]. After the tour Prince abolished The Revolution, fired [[Wendy & Lisa]] and replaced [[Bobby Z.]] with Sheila E. Brown Mark quit the band while keyboardist Doctor Fink remained. Prince then recruited new band members [[Miko Weaver]] on guitar, [[Atlanta Bliss]] on trumpet, [[Eric Leeds]] on saxophone, Boni Boyer on keyboards, [[Levi Seacer, Jr.]] on bass and dancer [[Cat Glover]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Prior to the disbanding of The Revolution, Prince was working on two separate projects, The Revolution album \'\'[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]\'\' and a solo effort, \'\'[[Unreleased Prince projects|Camille]]\'\'.<ref name="draper 76-78">Draper, pp. 76\xe2\x80\x9378.</ref> Unlike the three previous band albums, \'\'Dream Factory\'\' included significant input from the band members and even featured a number of songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa,<ref name="draper 76-78" /> while the \'\'Camille\'\' project saw Prince create a new persona primarily singing in a speeded-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of The Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled \'\'[[Crystal Ball (unreleased album)|Crystal Ball]]\'\'.<ref>Draper, p. 80.</ref> However, Warner Bros. forced Prince to trim the triple album to a double album and \'\'[[Sign "O" the Times]]\'\' was released on March 31, 1987.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times">{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}|title=Sign \'O\' the Times|work=Billboard |accessdate=March 3, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The album peaked at No.6 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 albums chart.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> The first single, "[[Sign o\' the Times (song)|Sign o\' the Times]]", would chart at No. 3 on the Hot 100.<ref name="Prince chart history billboard">{{cite web|url= {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080610060841/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}|archivedate= June 10, 2008|title=Artist Chart History&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 Prince|work=Billboard|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> The follow-up single, "[[If I Was Your Girlfriend]]" charted poorly at No. 67 on the Hot 100, but went to No.12 on R&B chart.<ref name="Prince chart history billboard" /> The third single, a duet with [[Sheena Easton]], "[[U Got the Look]]" charted at No. 2 on the Hot 100, No. 11 on the R&B chart,<ref name="Prince chart history billboard" /> and the final single "[[I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man]]" finished at No.10 on Hot 100 and No.14 on the R&B chart.<ref name="Prince chart history billboard" />

Despite receiving the greatest critical acclaim of any album in Prince\'s career, including being named the top album of the year by the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics\' poll, and eventually selling 3.2&nbsp;million copies, album sales steadily declined.<ref>Draper, p. 81.</ref> In Europe, however, it performed well and Prince promoted the album overseas with a lengthy tour. Putting together a new backing band from the remnants of The Revolution, Prince added bassist Levi Seacer, Jr., Boni Boyer on keyboards, and dancer/choreographer Cat Glover to go with new drummer Sheila E. and holdovers Miko Weaver, Doctor Fink, Eric Leeds, Atlanta Bliss, and the Bodyguards (Jerome, Wally Safford, and Greg Brooks) for the [[Sign o\' the Times Tour]].

The tour was a success overseas, with Warner Bros. and Prince\'s managers wanting to bring it to the US to resuscitate sagging sales of \'\'Sign "O" the Times\'\';<ref name="draper 86-87">Draper, pp. 86\xe2\x80\x9387.</ref>{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}} however, Prince balked at a full US tour, as he was ready to produce a new album.<ref name="draper 86-87" /> As a compromise the last two nights of the tour were filmed for release in movie theaters. The film quality was deemed subpar and reshoots were performed at his Paisley Park studios.<ref name="draper 86-87" /> The film \'\'[[Sign o\' the Times (film)|Sign o\' the Times]]\'\' was released on November 20, 1987. Much like the album, the film garnered more critical praise than the previous year\'s \'\'Under the Cherry Moon\'\'; however, its box-office receipts were minimal, and it quickly left theaters.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 118}}

The next album intended for release was to be \'\'[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]\'\'.<ref>Draper, p. 90</ref> More instrumental and funk and R&B themed than recent releases,<ref>Draper, p. 92</ref> \'\'The Black Album\'\' also saw Prince experiment with [[hip hop music]] on the songs "Bob George" and "Dead on It". Prince was set to release the album with a monochromatic black cover with only the catalog number printed, but after 500,000 copies had been pressed,<ref>Draper, p. 91</ref> Prince had a spiritual epiphany that the album was evil and had it recalled.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 121\xe2\x80\x93122}} It would later be released by Warner Bros. as a limited edition album in 1994. Prince went back in the studio for eight weeks and recorded \'\'[[Lovesexy]]\'\'.

Released on May 10, 1988, \'\'Lovesexy\'\' serves as a spiritual opposite to the dark \'\'The Black Album\'\'.<ref>Draper, p. 93</ref> Every song is a solo effort by Prince, with exception of "Eye No" which was recorded with his backing band at the time, dubbed the "Lovesexy Band" by fans. \'\'Lovesexy\'\' would reach No. 11 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 and No. 5 on the R&B albums chart.<ref name="Lovesexy billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}|title=Lovesexy|work=Billboard magazine|accessdate=January 13, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The lead single, "[[Alphabet St.]]", peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B chart,<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> but finished with only selling 750,000 copies.<ref>Draper, p. 94.</ref>

Prince again took his post-Revolution backing band (minus the Bodyguards) on a three leg, 84-show [[Lovesexy World Tour]]; although the shows were well received by huge crowds, they lost money due to the expensive sets and incorporated props.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 152\xe2\x80\x93153}}<ref>Draper, p. 95.</ref>
[[File:Prince by jimieye.jpg|thumb|left|Prince performing during his [[Nude Tour]] in 1990]]
In 1989, Prince appeared on [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\'s studio album \'\'[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]\'\', co-writing and singing the duet "Love Song" and playing electric guitar (uncredited) on the songs "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", and "Act of Contrition". He also began work on a number of musical projects, including \'\'[[Unreleased Prince projects|Rave Unto the Joy Fantastic]]\'\' and early drafts of his \'\'Graffiti Bridge\'\' film,{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 155\xe2\x80\x93156}}<ref>Draper, p. 96</ref> but both were put on hold when he was asked by \'\'[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\'\' director [[Tim Burton]] to record several songs for the upcoming live-action adaptation. Prince went into the studio and produced an entire nine-track album that Warner Bros. released on June 20, 1989. \'\'[[Batman (album)|Batman]]\'\' peaked at No.1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200,<ref name="batman billboard">{{cite web|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}| title=Batman|work=Billboard|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> selling 4.3&nbsp;million copies.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 157}} The single "[[Batdance]]" topped the \'\'Billboard\'\' and R&B charts.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" />

Additionally, the single "[[The Arms of Orion]]" with Sheena Easton charted at No. 36, and "[[Partyman]]" (also featuring the vocals of Prince\'s then-girlfriend, nicknamed [[Anna Fantastic]]) charted at No. 18 on the Hot 100 and at No. 5 on the R&B chart, while the love ballad "[[Scandalous!]]" went to No. 5 on the R&B chart.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> However, he did have to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack.

In 1990, Prince went back on tour with a revamped band for his stripped down, back-to-basics [[Nude Tour]]. With the departures of Boni Boyer, Sheila E., the horns, and Cat, Prince brought in Rosie Gaines on keys, drummer [[Michael Bland]], and dancing trio The Game Boyz ([[Tony M.]], Kirky J., and Damon Dickson). The European and Japanese tour was a financial success with its short, greatest hits setlist.{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 166}} As the year progressed, Prince finished production on his fourth film, \'\'[[Graffiti Bridge (film)|Graffiti Bridge]]\'\', and the [[Graffiti Bridge (album)|album of the same name]]. Initially, Warner Bros. was reluctant to fund the film, but with Prince\'s assurances it would be a sequel to \'\'[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]\'\' as well as the involvement of the original members of The Time, the studio greenlit the project.<ref>Draper, p. 104.</ref> Released on August 20, 1990, the album reached No. 6 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 and R&B albums chart.<ref name="Graffiti Bridge billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}}|title=Graffiti Bridge|work=Billboard|accessdate=January 13, 2001}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The single "[[Thieves in the Temple]]" reaching No. 6 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&B chart.<ref name="Billboard Sign o the times" /> Also from that album, "[[Round and Round (Tevin Campbell song)|Round and Round]]" placed at No. 12 on the US charts and No. 2 on the R&B charts. The song featured the teenage [[Tevin Campbell]] (who also had a role in the film) on lead vocals. The film, released on November 20, 1990, was a critical and box-office flop, grossing just $4.2&nbsp;million.<ref>Draper, p. 105.</ref> After the release of the film and album, the last remaining members of The Revolution, Miko Weaver and Doctor Fink, left Prince\'s band.

===1991\xe2\x80\x9394: The New Power Generation, \'\'Diamonds and Pearls\'\' and name change===
[[File:Yellow Cloud.jpg|thumb|Prince\'s Yellow Cloud Guitar at the [[Smithsonian Castle]]. Prince can be seen playing this guitar in the "[[Gett Off]]" video.]]
1991 marked the debut of Prince\'s new band, the [[The New Power Generation|New Power Generation]]. With guitarist Miko Weaver and long-time keyboardist Doctor Fink gone, Prince added bass player [[Sonny T.]], [[Tommy Barbarella]] on keyboards, and a brass section known as the Hornheads to go along with Levi Seacer (taking over on guitar), Rosie Gaines, [[Michael Bland]], and the Game Boyz. With significant input from his band members, \'\'[[Diamonds and Pearls]]\'\' was released on October 1, 1991. Reaching No. 3 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 album chart,{{sfn|Hahn|2004|p = 177}} \'\'Diamonds and Pearls\'\' saw four hit singles released in the United States. "[[Gett Off]]" peaked at No. 21 on the Hot 100 and No. 6 on the R&B charts, followed by "[[Cream (song)|Cream]]", which gave Prince his fifth US No. 1 single. The title track "[[Diamonds and Pearls (song)|Diamonds and Pearls]]" became the album\'s third single, reaching No. 3 on the Hot 100 and the top spot on the R&B charts. "[[Money Don\'t Matter 2 Night]]" peaked at No. 23 and No. 14 on the Hot 100 and R&B charts respectively.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=prince|chart=all}} |title=Discography (more) \xe2\x80\x93 Prince&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 Sign \'O\' the Times |work=Billboard |date=May 9, 1987 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

1992 saw Prince and The New Power Generation release his 12th album, \'\'Love Symbol Album\'\',<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Prince+%26+The+New+Power+Generation Prince & The New Power Generation Discography].

The follow-up single "[[Sexy MF]]" fared worse, charting at No. 66 on the Hot 100 and No. 76 on the R&B chart.

After two failed attempts in 1990 and 1991,{{sfn|Hahn|2004|pp = 192\xe2\x80\x93193}} Warner Bros. finally released a [[greatest hits]] compilation with the three-disc \'\'[[The Hits/The B-Sides]]\'\' in 1993. The first two discs were also sold separately as \'\'The Hits 1\'\' and \'\'The Hits 2\'\'. In addition to featuring the majority of Prince\'s hit singles (with the exception of "[[Batdance]]" and other songs that appeared on the \'\'[[Batman (album)|Batman]]\'\' soundtrack), \'\'The Hits\'\' includes an array of previously hard-to-find recordings, notably [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] spanning the majority of Prince\'s career, as well as a handful of previously unreleased tracks such as the Revolution-recorded "Power Fantastic" and a live recording of "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]" with Rosie Gaines. Two new songs, "[[Pink Cashmere]]" and "[[Peach (song)|Peach]]", were chosen as promotional singles to accompany the compilation album.

1993 also marked the year in which Prince changed his stage name to the Love Symbol (see left), which was explained as a combination of the [[Gender symbol|symbols]] for male (\xe2\x99\x82) and female (\xe2\x99\x80).<ref name="nytimes_07-11-02" /> In order to use the symbol in print media, Warner Bros. had to organize a mass mailing of floppy disks with a custom font.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wv/Royalbadness/bio.html |title=Prince The Artist BIO, Biography |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref> Because the symbol had no stated pronunciation, he was often referred to as "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince", TAFKAP, and "The Artist".

===1994\xe2\x80\x932000: Increased output and \'\'The Gold Experience\'\'===
In 1994, Prince\'s attitude towards his artistic output underwent a notable shift. He began to view releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting himself from his contractual obligations to Warner Bros. The label, he believed, was intent on limiting his artistic freedom by insisting that he release albums more sporadically. He also blamed Warner Bros. for the poor commercial performance of the \'\'Love Symbol Album\'\', claiming that it was insufficiently marketed by Warner. It was out of these developments that the aborted \'\'[[The Black Album (Prince album)|The Black Album]]\'\' was officially released, approximately seven years after its initial recording and near-release. The "new" release, which was already in wide circulation as a [[bootleg recording|bootleg]], sold relatively poorly.

Following that disappointing venture, Warner Bros. succumbed to Prince\'s wishes to release an album of new material, to be entitled \'\'[[Come (Prince album)|Come]]\'\'. When \'\'Come\'\' was eventually released, it confirmed all of Warner\'s fears. It became Prince\'s poorest-selling album to date, struggling to even shift 500,000 copies. Even more frustrating was the fact that Prince insisted on crediting the album to "Prince 1958\xe2\x80\x931993".

Prince pushed to have his next album \'\'[[The Gold Experience]]\'\' released simultaneously with \'\'Love Symbol\'\'-era material. Warner Bros. allowed the single "[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]" to be released via a small, independent distributor, [[Bellmark Records]], in February 1994. The release was successful, reaching No. 3 on the US \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 and No. 1 in many other countries, but it would not prove to be a model for subsequent releases. Warner Bros. still resisted releasing \'\'The Gold Experience\'\', fearing poor sales and citing "[[market saturation]]" as a defense. When eventually released in September 1995, \'\'The Gold Experience\'\' failed to sell well, although it reached the top 10 of the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 initially, and many reviewed it as Prince\'s best effort since \'\'Sign "O" the Times\'\'. The album is now out-of-print.
\'\'[[Chaos and Disorder]]\'\', released in 1996, was Prince\'s final album of new material for Warner Bros., as well as one of his least commercially successful releases. Prince attempted a major comeback later that year when, free of any further contractual obligations to Warner Bros., he released \'\'[[Emancipation (Prince album)|Emancipation]]\'\', a 36-song, 3-CD set (each disc was exactly 60 minutes long). The album was released via his own [[NPG Records]] with distribution through [[EMI]]. To publish his songs on \'\'Emancipation\'\', Prince did not use \'\'Controversy Music\'\'&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'\'ASCAP\'\', which he had used for all his records since 1981, but rather used \'\'Emancipated Music Inc.\'\'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=PRINCE&search_in=a&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=30&start=1 |title=ASCAP profile for Emancipated Music |publisher=Ascap.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 \'\'ASCAP\'\'.

Certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], \'\'Emancipation\'\' is the first record featuring [[cover version|covers]] by Prince of songs of other artists: [[Joan Osborne]]\'s top ten hit song of 1995 "[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]";<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=joan osborne|chart=all}}|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080521101753/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=joan osborne|chart=all}}|archivedate=May 21, 2008 |title=Chart history for \'One Of Us\' |work=Billboard |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> "[[Betcha by Golly Wow!]]" (written by Thomas Randolf Bell and Linda Creed);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=108308&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |title=BMI credits for "Betcha By Golly Wow!" |publisher=Repertoire.bmi.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> "[[I Can\'t Make You Love Me]]" (written by James Allen Shamblin II and Michael Barry Reid);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=390493822&search_in=i&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=20&start=1 |title=BMI credits for "I Can\'t Make You Love Me" |publisher=Ascap.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> and "[[La-La (Means I Love You)]]" (written by Thomas Randolf Bell and William Hart).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=819010&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID |title=BMI credits for "La-La Means I Love You" |publisher=Repertoire.bmi.com |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

Prince released \'\'[[Crystal Ball (album set)|Crystal Ball]]\'\', a five-CD collection of unreleased material, in 1998. The distribution of this album was disorderly, with some fans pre-ordering the album on his website up to a year before it was eventually shipped to them; these pre-orders were eventually delivered months after the record had gone on sale in retail stores. The retail edition has only four discs, as it is missing the \'\'Kamasutra\'\' disc. There are also two different packaging editions for retail, one being in a four-disc sized jewel case with a simple white cover and the Love Symbol in a colored circle; the other is all four discs in a round translucent snap jewel case. The discs are the same, as is the CD jacket. The \'\'[[Newpower Soul]]\'\' album released three months later failed to make much of an impression on the charts. His collaboration on [[Chaka Khan]]\'s \'\'[[Come 2 My House]]\'\', and [[Larry Graham]]\'s \'\'[[GCS2000]]\'\', both released on the [[NPG Records]] label around the same time as \'\'Newpower Soul\'\' met with the same fate, despite heavy promotion and live appearances on \'\'[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe with Sinbad]]\'\', and the [[NBC]] \'\'[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]\'\' show\'s Summer Concert Series.

In 1999, Prince once again signed with a major label, [[Arista Records]], to release a new record, \'\'[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]\'\'. In an attempt to make his new album a success, Prince easily gave more interviews than at any other point in his career, appearing on MTV\'s \'\'[[Total Request Live]]\'\' (with his album cover on the front of the [[Virgin Megastore]], in the background on \'\'TRL\'\' throughout the whole show), \'\'[[Larry King Live]]\'\' (with Larry Graham) and other media outlets. Nevertheless, \'\'Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\'\' failed to perform well commercially. A few months earlier, Warner Bros. had also released \'\'[[The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale]]\'\', a collection of unreleased material recorded by Prince throughout his career, and his final recording commitment on his contract with Warner Bros. The greatest success he had during the year was with the EP \'\'[[1999: The New Master]]\'\', released in time for Prince to collect a small portion of the sales dollars Warner Bros. had been seeing for the album and singles of the original \'\'1999\'\'.

The pay-per-view concert, \'\'[[Rave Un2 the Year 2000]]\'\', was broadcast on December 31, 1999 and consisted of footage from the December 17 and 18 concerts of his 1999 tour. The concert featured appearances by many guest musicians including [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], Jimmy Russell, and The Time. It was released to home video the following year. A remix album, \'\'[[Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic]]\'\' (as opposed to "Un2") was released exclusively through Prince\'s [[NPG Music Club]] in April 2000.

===2000\xe2\x80\x9306: Turnaround, \'\'Musicology\'\', label change and \'\'3121\'\'===
On May 16, 2000, Prince ceased using the Love Symbol moniker and returned to using "Prince" again, after his publishing contract with [[Warner/Chappell Music|Warner/Chappell]] expired. In a press conference, he stated that, after being freed from undesirable relationships associated with the name "Prince", he would formally revert to using his real name. Prince still frequently uses the symbol as a logo and on album artwork and continues to play a Love Symbol-shaped guitar.
For several years following the release of \'\'Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic\'\', Prince primarily released new music through his Internet subscription service, NPGOnlineLtd.com (later NPGMusicClub.com). Two albums that show substantive jazz influence were available commercially at record stores: 2001\'s \'\'[[The Rainbow Children]]\'\', and the 2003 instrumental record \'\'[[N.E.W.S]]\'\' which was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album|Best Pop Instrumental Album]] Grammy Award. Another album of largely jazz-influenced music, \'\'[[Xpectation]]\'\', was released via download in 2003 to members of the NPGMusicClub. \'\'Xpectation\'\' is jazz themed along with new age and atmospheric themes.

In 2002, Prince released his first live album, \'\'[[One Nite Alone... Live!]]\'\', which features performances from the [[One Nite Alone...Tour]]. The 3-CD box set, which also includes a disc of "aftershow" music entitled \'\'It Ain\'t Over!\'\', failed to chart. During this time, Prince sought to engage more effectively with his fan base via the [[NPG Music Club]], pre-concert sound checks, and at yearly "celebrations" at [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]], his music studios. Fans were invited into the studio for tours, interviews, discussions and music-listening sessions. Some of these fan discussions were filmed for an [[Unreleased Prince projects#Untitled Kevin Smith-directed documentary|unreleased documentary]], directed by [[Kevin Smith]]. Smith discusses what happened during those days at length in his \'\'[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]\'\' DVD. Performances were also arranged to showcase Prince\'s talents, as well as to collaborate with popular and well-established artists and guests including [[Alicia Keys]], the [[The Time (band)|Time]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Nikka Costa]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], and [[Norah Jones]].

On February 8, 2004, Prince appeared at the [[Grammy Award]]s with [[Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles]]. In a performance that opened the show, Prince and Knowles performed a medley of "[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]", "[[Let\'s Go Crazy]]", "[[Baby I\'m a Star]]", and Knowles\' "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc\xc3\xa9 Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]". The following month, Prince was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The award was presented to him by Alicia Keys along with [[Big Boi]] and [[Andr\xc3\xa9 3000]] of [[OutKast]]. As well as performing a trio of his own hits during the ceremony, Prince also participated in a tribute to fellow inductee [[George Harrison]] in a rendering of Harrison\'s "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", playing a long guitar solo that ended the song. In addition he performed "Red House" on the album \'\'[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]\'\'.
On February 19, \'\'[[The Tavis Smiley Show]]\'\' broadcast included a performance of "Reflection" from Prince\'s \'\'Musicology\'\' album. Prince was accompanied by Wendy Melvoin, formerly of The Revolution.

In April 2004, Prince released \'\'[[Musicology (album)|Musicology]]\'\' through a one-album agreement with [[Columbia Records]]. The album rose as high as the top five on a number of international charts (including the US, UK, Germany and Australia). The US chart success was assisted by the CD being included as part of the concert ticket purchase, and each CD thereby qualifying (as chart rules then stood) towards US chart placement. \'\'Musicology\'\' is R&B and soul-themed along with funk, pop, quiet storm, and rock. Three months later, \'\'[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]\'\' named him the greatest [[frontman]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/prince-tops-frontmen-poll|title=Prince Tops Frontmen Poll|date=July 27, 2004|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|location=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hjd4p0fC|archivedate=June 29, 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=June 29, 2013}}</ref>
That same year, \'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine named Prince as the highest-earning musician in the world, with an annual income of $56.5&nbsp;million,<ref>{{Cite news| title = Prince crowned \'top music earner\' |publisher=BBC | date = February 9, 2005| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4251227.stm}}</ref> largely due to his [[Musicology Tour]], which [[Pollstar]] named as the top concert draw among musicians in US. The artist played an impressive run of 96 concerts; the average ticket price for a show was US$61. Further highlighting the success of the album, Prince\'s \'\'Musicology\'\' went on to receive two Grammy wins, for [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for "[[Call My Name (Prince song)|Call My Name]]" and Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance for the [[Musicology (song)|title track]]. \'\'Musicology\'\' was also nominated for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Album, while "[[Cinnamon Girl (Prince song)|Cinnamon Girl]]" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. The album became the artist\'s most commercially successful since \'\'[[Diamonds and Pearls]]\'\', partly due to a radical scheme devised which included in \'\'Billboard\'\'\xe2\x80\xb2s sales figures those that were distributed to each customer during ticket sales for the \'\'Musicology\'\' tour, with concert figures accounting for 25% of the total album sales.<ref>{{cite web| last = D\'Angelo| first = Joe | title = Billboard Sours On Prince\'s Musicology Sales Experiment: Magazine changes policy on tallying albums sold with tickets|publisher=MTV| date = May 28, 2004| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488027/20040528/prince.jhtml}}</ref>
\'\'Rolling Stone\'\' magazine has ranked Prince No. 27 on their list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref name="rollingstone2004" />

In April 2005, Prince played guitar (along with [[En Vogue]] singing backing vocals) on [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s single "[[So What the Fuss]]", Wonder\'s first since 1999.<ref>{{cite web| title = So What the Fuss credits| work=Discog| url = http://www.discogs.com/Stevie-Wonder-So-What-The-Fuss/release/736771}}</ref>
In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], which devastated the city of New Orleans on August 29, 2005, Prince offered a personal response by recording two new songs, "[[S.S.T. (song)|S.S.T.]]" and the instrumental "Brand New Orleans", at [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]] in the early hours of September 2. Prince again performed all instrumental and vocal parts. These recordings were quickly dispersed to the public via Prince\'s NPG Music Club, and "S.S.T." was later picked up by [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], where it reached No. 1 on the store\'s R&B chart. On October 25, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Records]] released a version of the single on CD.

In late 2005, Prince signed with [[Universal Records]] to release his album, \'\'[[3121 (album)|3121]]\'\', on March 21, 2006 (3/21). The first single was the Latin-tinged "[[Te Amo Coraz\xc3\xb3n]]", the video for which was directed by actress [[Salma Hayek]] and filmed in [[Marrakech]], Morocco, featuring Argentine actress and singer [[M\xc3\xada Maestro]]. The video for the second single, "[[Black Sweat]]", was nominated at the [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV VMAs]] for Best Cinematography. The immediate success of \'\'3121\'\' gave Prince his first No. 1 debut on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 with the album.
To promote the new album, Prince was the musical guest on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' on February 4, 2006, 17 years after his last \'\'SNL\'\' appearance on the 15th anniversary special and nearly 25 years since his first appearance on a regular episode in 1981, making Prince the only \'\'SNL\'\' musical guest to have that long of a gap between appearances. He performed two songs from the album, "[[Fury (song)|Fury]]" and "Beautiful, Loved & Blessed", with [[T\xc3\xa1mar]]. Prince also held a contest to win a trip to see a \'Purple Ticket Concert\' at his private residence in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], California. Seven winning tickets were placed inside \'\'3121\'\' CD packages in the US, and other tickets were given away in various contests on the Internet and around the world. On May 6, 2006, 24 prizewinners (with a guest each) attended a star-studded private party and performance at Prince\'s home.

On June 12, 2006, Prince received a [[Webby Awards|Webby]] Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his "visionary" use of the Internet; Prince was the first major artist to release an entire album, 1997\'s \'\'[[Crystal Ball (album set)|Crystal Ball]]\'\', exclusively on the Internet (although he did take phone orders for it as well...1-800-NEW-FUNK).

Only weeks after winning a Webby Award, Prince abruptly shut down his then-official [[NPG Music Club]] website on July 4, 2006, after more than five years of operation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} On the day of the music club\'s shutdown, a lawsuit was filed against Prince by the British company HM Publishing (owners of the [[Nature Publishing Group]], also NPG). Despite these events occurring on the same day, Prince\'s attorney has called it pure coincidence and stated that the site did not close due to the trademark dispute.<ref>{{cite web| last = Finn| first = Natalie| title = Prince Site Fades to Black |publisher=E!| date = July 12, 2006| url = http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b52791_prince_site_fades_black.html}}</ref>
Prince appeared at multiple award ceremonies in 2006. On February 15, 2006, Prince performed at the [[The BRIT Awards|BRIT Awards]] along with Wendy & Lisa and Sheila E. He played "Te Amo Coraz\xc3\xb3n" and "Fury" from \'\'3121\'\' and "Purple Rain" and "Let\'s Go Crazy" from \'\'Purple Rain\'\'. On June 27, 2006, Prince appeared at the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] [[BET Awards|Awards]], where he was awarded Best Male R&B Artist. In addition to receiving his award, Prince performed a medley of Chaka Khan songs for Khan\'s BET Lifetime Award. Prince had previously written and performed several songs with the singer.

In November 2006, Prince was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]], appearing to collect his award but not performing. Also in November 2006, Prince opened a nightclub named 3121 in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] at the [[Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino]]. He performed weekly on Friday and Saturday nights until April 2007, when his contract with the Rio ended.
On August 22, 2006, Prince released \'\'[[Ultimate Prince]]\'\'. The double disc set contains one CD of previous hits, and another of extended versions and mixes of material that had largely only previously been available on vinyl record B-sides. Prince wrote and performed a song for the hit 2006 animated film \'\'[[Happy Feet]]\'\'. The song, entitled "[[The Song of the Heart]]", appears on the film\'s [[Happy Feet: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack]], which also features a cover of Prince\'s earlier hit "Kiss", sung by [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]]. In January 2007, "The Song of the Heart" won a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for Best Original Song.<ref>{{cite web| title = Golden Globe Awards| work=goldenglobes.org| url = http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30963}}</ref>

Coincidentally, Miami had rain on the day of the Super Bowl, which was lit purple during the performance of "Purple Rain". He played on a large stage shaped as his symbol. The event was carried to 140 million television viewers, the largest audience of his life. On February 4, 2010, Billboard.com ranked the performance as the greatest Super Bowl performance ever.<ref name="Hoekstra">{{Cite news| title=Purple rain turned super|date=February 5, 2007|author=Dave Hoekstra|url= http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/243107,CST-FTR-super05.article |work=Chicago Sun-Times}} Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref>

A prelude to the forthcoming summer gigs in London, Prince played a relaxed set of hits including ("[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]", changing the lyric from "You don\'t have to watch \'\'[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]\'\'" to \'\'[[Desperate Housewives]]\'\', "[[Girls & Boys (Prince song)|Girls & Boys]]", and "[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]") alongside more recent tracks, plus a cover version of [[Gnarls Barkley]]\'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]".

Prince made an appearance at the 2007 [[ALMA Award]]s, performing with Sheila E. in June 2007. On June 28, 2007, the UK national newspaper the \'\'[[The Mail on Sunday|Mail on Sunday]]\'\' revealed that it had made a deal to give Prince\'s new album, \'\'[[Planet Earth (Prince album)|Planet Earth]]\'\', away for free with an "imminent" edition of the paper, making it the first place in the world to get the album. This move sparked controversy among music distributors and also led the UK arm of Prince\'s distributor, [[Sony BMG]], to withdraw from distributing the album in UK stores.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Allen| first = Katie| title = Music industry attacks Sunday newspaper\'s free Prince CD|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = June 29, 2007| url = http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2114557,00.html| accessdate =July 18, 2009 }}</ref> The UK\'s largest high street music retailer, [[HMV]], decided to stock the paper on release day due to the giveaway. \'\'Planet Earth\'\' is rock-oriented along with disco, and other various music styles.

On April 25, 2008, Prince performed on \'\'[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]\'\', where he debuted a new song, "Turn Me Loose".

Prince cancelled a concert, planned at Dublin\'s [[Croke Park]] on June 16, 2008, at just 10 days\' notice. In October 2009 promoters [[MCD Productions]] went to court to sue Prince for \xe2\x82\xac1.6 million, after paying him $1.5&nbsp;million, half his agreed fee of $3&nbsp;million for the concert. MCD claim they had to refund 55,126 tickets purchased and its total losses exceeded $1.66&nbsp;million.

Speaking about her relationship with Prince in an interview with Norwegian station [[NRK]] in November 2014, [[Sinead O\'Connor]] said that Prince had summoned her to his house after "[[Nothing Compares 2U]]".

==Multi-instrumental abilities==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2014}}
In addition to his singing abilities (which encompass a wide range from falsetto to baritone and rapid, flamboyant shifts of register, as well as diverse characterisation) Prince is one of pop music\'s most prominent multi-instrumentalists. The precise number of instruments he is capable of playing remains obscure, partly due to the active mythologizing of his abilities and working practices (such as the claim that he had played "all 27 instruments" on his debut album, which appears to have included various different kinds of guitar, keyboard and synthesizer in the total).

As a live performer he tends to focus on guitar, piano, lead vocals and occasional harmonica. On recordings he has also played assorted keyboards and synthesizers, bass guitar, drums, various percussion instruments and saxophone, as well as mastering both drum and synthesizer programming. Prince has mentioned learning and performing simple parts on particular instruments that he does not otherwise play (such as concert harp) in order to serve song arrangements on albums.

==Stage names==
In 1993, during negotiations regarding the release of \'\'[[The Gold Experience]]\'\', a legal battle ensued between Warner Bros. and Prince over the artistic and financial control of his musical output. During the lawsuit, he appeared in public with the word "slave" written on his cheek. Prince explained his name change as follows:

{{quote|The first step I have taken toward the ultimate goal of emancipation from the chains that bind me to Warner Bros. was to change my name from Prince to the Love Symbol. Prince is the name that my mother gave me at birth. Warner Bros. took the name, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all of the music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related music marketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros...

I was born Prince and did not want to adopt another conventional name. The only acceptable replacement for my name, and my identity, was the Love Symbol, a symbol with no pronunciation, that is a representation of me and what my music is about. This symbol is present in my work over the years; it is a concept that has evolved from my frustration; it is who I am. It is my name.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Heatley| first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Heatley| title = Where Were You...

\'\'Prince\'\' is a trademark owned by Paisley Park Enterprises Inc. It was initially filed with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) in 2005 in the categories of printed materials, clothing, electronic commerce, and entertainment services based on first commercial in 1978.<ref>United States Patent and Trademark Office. Serial Number: 78561384; Registration Number: 3128896</ref> Various searches to the USPTO did not find any registrations or transfers of "Prince" or related names by Warner Bros.

Prince has used pseudonyms to separate himself from the music (either his own or that of others) for which he has had input; "I was just getting tired of seeing my name," he said, "If you give away an idea, you still own that idea. In fact, giving it away strengthens it. Why do people feel they have to take credit for everything they do? Ego, that\'s the only reason."<ref>{{Cite news| last = Coryat | first = Karl| title = His Highness Gets Down!| newspaper=Bass Player| date = November 1999| url = http://princetext.tripod.com/i_bass99.html}}</ref> These pseudonyms include: \'\'\'Jamie Starr\'\'\' and \'\'\'The Starr Company\'\'\' (for the songs he wrote for the [[The Time (band)|Time]] and many other artists from 1981\xe2\x80\x931984),<ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to Jamie Starr|work=Discogs| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jamie+Starr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to The Starr Company | url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Starr+*+Company%2C+The}}</ref> \'\'\'Joey Coco\'\'\' (for many unreleased Prince songs in the late 1980s, as well as songs written for [[Sheena Easton]] & Kenny Rogers),<ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to Joey Coco| work=Discogs| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Joey+Coco}}</ref> \'\'\'Paisley Park\'\'\' (occasionally used in the early 1990s for his production credits on songs, including those written for [[Martika]] and [[Kid Creole]]),<ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to Paisley Park | work=Discogs| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Paisley+Park }}</ref> \'\'\'Alexander Nevermind\'\'\' (for writing the 1984 song "[[Sugar Walls]]" by Sheena Easton),<ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to Alexander Nevermind | work=Discogs| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Alexander+Nevermind}}</ref> and \'\'\'Christopher\'\'\' (used for his song writing credit of "[[Manic Monday]]" for the [[The Bangles|Bangles]]).<ref>{{cite web| title = Songs credited to Christopher | work=Discogs| url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/Christopher}}</ref>

==Copyright issues==
On September 14, 2007, Prince announced that he was going to sue [[YouTube]] and [[eBay]] because they "are clearly able [to] filter porn and pedophile material but appear to choose not to filter out the unauthorized music and film content which is core to their business success." [[Web Sheriff]], the international Internet policing company he hired, told Reuters: "The problem is that one can reduce it to zero and then the next day there will be 100 or 500 or whatever. This carries on ad nauseam at Prince\'s expense."<ref>{{cite web| title = Prince To Sue YouTube, eBay Over Unauthorized Content|work=Billboard | year = 2007| url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049302/prince-to-sue-youtube-ebay-over-unauthorized-content}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title = Prince takes on YouTube over clips|work=The Times |location=London| date = September 13, 2007| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article2447862.ece| first=Fiona| last=Hamilton}}</ref>

In October 2007, Stephanie Lenz filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Publishing Group, claiming they were abusing copyright law, after the music publisher had YouTube take down Lenz\'s home movie in which the Prince song "[[Let\'s Go Crazy]]" played faintly in the background.<ref>{{cite web| last = Francescani | first = Chris| title = The Home Video Prince Doesn\'t Want You to See|publisher=ABC News| date = October 26, 2007 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3777651&page=1}}</ref>

On November 5, 2007, several fan sites of Prince formed "Prince Fans United" to fight back against legal requests they claim Prince made to cease and desist all use of photographs, images, lyrics, album covers and anything linked to Prince\'s likeness.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Gibson| first = Owen| title = Prince threatens to sue his fans over online images|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = November 7, 2007| url = http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2206460,00.html| accessdate =July 18, 2009 }}</ref> While Prince\'s lawyers claimed that the use of such representations constituted copyright infringement, the Prince Fans United claimed that the legal actions were "attempts to stifle all critical commentary about Prince." A few days later, Prince released a statement denying the fansites\' claims, stating "The action taken earlier this week was not to shut down fansites, or control comment in any way. The issue was simply to do with in regards to copyright and trademark of images and only images, and no lawsuits have been filed." The statement from [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG]], Prince\'s promoter, asserted that the only "offending items" on the three fansites were live shots from Prince\'s 21 nights in London at the O2 Arena earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web| title = Prince \'not suing fans\': Singer hits back at fansite claims|work=NME | date = November 9, 2007 |url = http://www.nme.com/news/prince/32426}}</ref>

On November 8, 2007, Prince Fans United received a song named "PFUnk", providing a kind of "unofficial answer" to their movement. The song, originally debuted on the PFU main site,<ref>{{cite web|last = Kreps|first = Daniel |title = Prince Releases Diss Track As Battle With Fans Gets Funky |work=Rolling Stone|date = November 9, 2007| url = http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/11/09/prince-releases-diss-track-as-battle-with-fans-gets-funky/}}</ref> was retitled "[[F.U.N.K.]]" and is available on iTunes.

On November 14, 2007, it was reported that the satirical website [[b3ta.com]] had pulled their "image challenge of the week" devoted to Prince after legal threats from the star under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. B3ta co-founder [[Rob Manuel]] wrote on the site:
"Under threat of legal action from Prince\'s legal team of \'potential closure of your web site\' \xe2\x80\x93 We have removed the Prince image challenge and B3ta apologizes unreservedly to AEG / NPG and Prince for any offence caused.

At the 2008 Coachella Music Festival, Prince performed a cover of [[Radiohead]]\'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]", but immediately after he forced YouTube and other sites to remove footage that fans had taken of the performance, despite Radiohead\'s demand for it to remain on the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/10102/prince_is_being_a_creep_radiohead_tell_him_hes_a_l/news/ |title= Prince Is Being A &#8220;Creep,&#8221; Radiohead Tell Him He&#8217;s A Loser - Stereogum |publisher=StereoGum |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}</ref> Days later, YouTube reinstated the videos, while Radiohead claimed "it\'s our song, let people hear it." In 2009, Prince put the video of that Coachella performance on his then-official website LotusFlow3r.com.

In 2013, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] granted to Prince the inaugural "Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/takedowns/prince-raspberry-beret-lifetime-aggrievement-award |title=The Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award |publisher=Eff.org |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref> a reference to resentment of parties who allege unfair treatment and misuse of copyright claims by the artist and his lawyers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/prince-inducted-takedown-hall-shame-new-lifetime-aggrievement-award |title=Prince Inducted Into Takedown Hall of Shame With New Lifetime Aggrievement Award &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}</ref>

}}
\'\'\'One Way\'\'\' was an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[funk music|funk]] band that was popular in the late 1970s, and throughout most of the 1980s, led by singer Al Hudson.  The group\'s most successful record was "[[Cutie Pie]]", which reached no.4 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart|Soul Singles]] chart and no.61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]] in 1982.

==Al Hudson and the Partners==
One Way was formed in 1978 in Detroit, Michigan as the newer incarnation of a band originally known as \'\'\'Soul Partners\'\'\'.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23987/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Ron Wynn |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref> Al Hudson, [[Alicia Myers]], guitarists Dave Roberson and Cortez Harris, bassist Kevin McCord, drummer Gregory Green and keyboardist Jonathan Meadows were the original members.<ref name="AMG"/> They first [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] as "Al Hudson and the Soul Partners", scoring an R&B [[hit record|hit]] on the [[ABC Records|ABC]] [[record label|label]] called "You Can Do It" in 1979.

==The 1980s==
At that time, however, ABC Records was in the process of being bought by [[MCA Records]], and when the band moved to the MCA label, they subsequently changed their name to \'\'\'One Way featuring Al Hudson\'\'\' before becoming One Way.<ref name="AMG"/> They were on MCA from 1980 to 1988.<ref name="AMG"/> They scored three [[Top 40|Top 10]] U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] hits, with the biggest being "[[Cutie Pie]]", which reached number four in 1982.<ref name="AMG"/> Original frontwoman Alicia Myers left the band in the early 1980s to pursue a solo career.  She was replaced by Candyce Edwards, who served as female lead of the group from 1981 to 1985. Edwards\' debut was on the \'\'Fancy Dancer\'\' album, and she remained with the group throughout the biggest successes, including "Cutie Pie."

They had minor hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "Music" (1979) and "Let\'s Talk About Shhh" (1985).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

They moved to [[Capitol Records]] in 1988, where they released their final album, \'\'A New Beginning\'\',<ref name="AMG"/> later that same year.  By this time, only Hudson, Roberson, and Meadows remained from the original line-up.

==Legacy==
Myers\' song "I Want to Thank You" was sampled by [[E-40]] in his song "I Wanna Thank You" featuring [[Suga-T]], taken from his 1996 album \'\'[[Tha Hall of Game]]\'\'. Also, [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Q-Tip]] sampled the song for Busta\'s "[[Thank You (Busta Rhymes song)|Thank You]]" 2013.

\'\'\'Barry White\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Barry Eugene Carter\'\'\'; {{Birth date|1944|9|12}} \xe2\x80\x93 {{death date|2003|7|4}}), was an American composer and singer-songwriter.

A 3-time [[Grammy Award]]-winner known for his distinctive [[bass-baritone]] voice and romantic image, White\'s greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with the [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]], crafting many enduring soul, [[funk]], and [[disco]] songs such as his two biggest hits, "[[You\'re the First, the Last, My Everything]]" and "[[Can\'t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe]]".

During the course of his career in the music business, White achieved 106 [[Music recording sales certification|gold albums]] worldwide, 41 of which also attained platinum status. White had 20 gold and 10 platinum singles, with worldwide records sales in excess of 100 million, he is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world\'s best-selling artists of all time]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sgvtribune.com/arts-and-entertainment/20130920/steve-smith-christine-mcvie-rejoins-the-mac-cher-says-no-to-russia-joel-santana-honored|title=Barry White Gets Walk of Fame Star|first=Steve|last=Smith|publisher=[[San Gabriel Valley Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>

==Early life==
Barry White was born \'\'\'Barry Eugene Carter\'\'\' in [[Galveston, Texas]],<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/929/000023860/ Barry White<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and grew up in the high-crime areas of [[South Central Los Angeles]]. White was the oldest of two brothers; his brother Darryl was 13 months younger. He grew up listening to his mother\'s classical music collection, and first took to the piano emulating what he heard on the records. His introduction to music led to him playing piano on [[Jesse Belvin]]\'s 1956 hit single, "[[Goodnight My Love (1956 song)|Goodnight My Love]]."<ref>Bobby Bennett and Sarah Smith, \'\'The Ultimate Soul Music Trivia Book: 501 Questions and Answers about Motown, Rhythm & Blues, and More\'\', Secaucus, NJ: Carol Pub. Group, c. 1998.</ref>

White recalled that, "[As a child] I had a normal squeaky kid voice. Then as a teenager, that completely changed. My mother cried because she knew her baby boy had become a man."

===Gang life and jail sentence===
His brother Darryl was murdered in a clash with a rival gang, and White himself was jailed \xe2\x80\x93 at the age of 17 \xe2\x80\x93 for stealing $30,000 worth of Cadillac tires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2386227.stm |title=Obituary: Barry White  |date=July 4, 2003 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

While in jail, White listened to [[Elvis Presley]] singing "[[It\'s Now or Never (song)|It\'s Now or Never]]" on the radio,<ref>[http://ivorcasey.blogspot.com \'\'Ivor Casey Blog\'\']</ref> an experience he later credited with changing the course of his life.<ref>Barry White with Marc Eliot, \'\'Love Unlimited,\'\' New York: Broadway Books, 1999, p. 22.</ref>

==Music career==

===The 1960s===
After his release from jail, he left gang life and began a musical career at the beginning of the 1960s in singing groups. He first released "Too Far to Turn Around" in 1960 as part of The Upfronts<ref name=discography>{{cite web |first=Pete |last=Old |url=http://members.chello.nl/p.klein6/Html/barry_white_discography.htm. |title=Barry White Discography |publisher=Barry White Unlimited FanClub |accessdate=March 16, 2012}}</ref> before working for various small independent labels in Los Angeles. He also recorded several singles under his own name in the early 1960s, backed by vocal groups the Atlantics (for the Rampart and Faro labels) and the Majestics (for the Linda and Jordan labels).<ref name=discography/>

[[Bob Keane]] of [[Del-Fi Records]] \xe2\x80\x93 the man who discovered [[Ritchie Valens]] \xe2\x80\x93 hired him as an [[A&R]] man in the mid-1960s, and White started working with the label\'s artists including [[Viola Wills]] and [[The Bobby Fuller Four]], as a songwriter, session musician, and arranger. He discovered singer [[Felice Taylor]] and arranged her song "I Feel Love Comin\' On", as well as "[[Harlem Shuffle]]" for [[Bob & Earl]].  Both records became big hits in the UK.<ref name=allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5815|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Barry White > Biography )))]</ref> He also wrote "Doin\' the Banana Split" for TV [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] act [[The Banana Splits]] in 1968.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Banana-Splits-Doin-The-Banana-Split/release/562111  "Doin\' The Banana Split" at Discogs.com]. Retrieved February 16, 2013</ref>

===The 1970s as producer===
In 1972, he got his big break producing a [[girl group]] he had discovered called [[Love Unlimited]]. Formed in imitative style of the [[Motown]] girl group [[The Supremes]], the group members had gradually honed their talents with White for two years previously until they signed contracts with [[Uni Records]]. His friend Paul Politi hooked him up with music industry businessman Larry Nunes, who helped to finance their album. After it was recorded, Nunes took the recording to [[Russ Regan]], who was the head of the [[Uni Records|Uni]] label owned by [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. The album, 1972\'s \'\'[[Love Unlimited (Love Unlimited album)|From A Girl\'s Point of View We Give to You... Love Unlimited]]\'\', became a million album seller and the first of White\'s string of long-titled albums and singles.

White produced, wrote and arranged their classic soul ballad, "[[Walking in the Rain with the One I Love]]", which climbed to #14 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] Pop chart and #6 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B chart in late 1972. This single also reached #12 in the UK chart. White\'s voice can clearly be heard in this piece as he plays the lover who answers the phone call of the female lead.

Soon after, Regan left Uni for [[20th Century Records]]. Without Regan, White\'s relationship with Uni soured. With his relationship with Uni over and Love Unlimited contract-bound with the label, White was able to switch both his production deal and the group to 20th Century Records. (They recorded several other hits throughout the 1970s, "I Belong to You", which spent over five months on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B chart in 1974 including a week at #1 and "Under the Influence of Love", which hit #3 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Pop album charts.  White married the lead singer of the group, [[Glodean White|Glodean James]], on July 4, 1974.)

===The 1970s as solo artist===
White wanted to work with another act but decided to work with a solo male artist. While working on a few demos for a male singer, he made three song demos of himself singing and playing, but Nunes heard them and insisted that he re-record and release them himself as a solo recording artist. After arguing for days about it, White was finally persuaded to release the songs himself although he was initially reluctant to step out in front of the microphone.

He then wrote several other songs and recorded them for what eventually became an entire album of music. He was going to use the name "White Heat," but decided on using his given name instead. White was still hesitating up to the time the label copy was made. It eventually became the first solo White album, 1973\'s \'\'[[I\'ve Got So Much to Give (album)|I\'ve Got So Much to Give]]\'\'. It included [[I\'ve Got So Much to Give|the title track]] and his first solo chart hit, "[[I\'m Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby]]", which also rose to #1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B charts as well as #3 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Pop charts in 1973 and stayed in the top 40 for many weeks.

Other chart hits by White included "[[Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up]]" (#2 R&B, #7 Pop in 1973), "[[Can\'t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe]]" (# 1 Pop and R&B in 1974), "[[You\'re the First, the Last, My Everything]]" (#1 R&B, #2 Pop in 1974), "[[What Am I Gonna Do with You]]" (#1 R&B, #8 Pop in 1975), "Let the Music Play" (#4 R&B in 1976), "[[It\'s Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me]]" (#1 R&B, #4 Pop in 1977) and "Your Sweetness is My Weakness" (#2 R&B in 1978) and others. White also had a strong following in the UK, where he scored five Top 10 hits and a #1 for "You\'re the First, the Last, My Everything".

===The Love Unlimited Orchestra===
In 1973 White created [[The Love Unlimited Orchestra]], a 40-piece orchestral group to be used originally as a backing band for the girl-group [[Love Unlimited]]. However, White had other plans, and in 1973 he released a single with "[[Love\'s Theme]]" (written by him and played by the Orchestra), that same track reached #1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Pop charts. Later, in 1974, he made the first album of the Love Unlimited Orchestra, \'\'[[Rhapsody in White]]\'\', containing "[[Love\'s Theme]]". White is sometimes credited with ushering in the "disco" sound, seamlessly combining R&B music with classical music. Some also regard "Love\'s Theme" as the first hit in the actual "[[disco era]]".

Barry White would continue to make albums with the Orchestra, achieving some successes such as: "Rhapsody in White"; "Satin Soul"; "Forever in Love"; "Midnight Groove"; "[[My Sweet Summer Suite]]", Remake of "Theme From King Kong". The Orchestra ceased to make albums in 1983, but continued to support Barry White as a backing band.

===The 1980s===
After six years White left 20th Century in 1979 to launch his own label, Unlimited Gold, with [[Columbia Records|CBS/Columbia Records]]. Although his success on the pop charts slowed down as the disco era came to an end, he maintained a loyal following throughout his career. Despite several albums over the next three years he failed to repeat his earlier successes, with no singles managing to reach the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 except for 1982\'s "Change," climbing into the Billboard R&B Top 20 (#12). His label venture was exacting a heavy financial cost on White, so he concentrated on mostly touring and finally folded his label in 1983.

After four years he signed with [[A&M Records]], and with the release of 1987\'s \'\'[[The Right Night & Barry White]]\'\', the single entitled "[[Sho\' You Right]]" made it to the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B charts, peaking at #17.

In 1989 he released \'\'[[The Man Is Back!]]\'\' and with it had three top 40 singles on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B charts: "Super Lover", which made it to #34, "I Wanna Do It Good to Ya", which made it to #26, and "When Will I See You Again", which made it to #32.

===The 1990s===
A 1970s nostalgia fad allowed White to enjoy a renewed wave of popularity in the 1990s. After White participated in a [[Quincy Jones]] record entitled \'\'[[Back on the Block]]\'\', on the song titled "[[The Secret Garden (Sweet Seduction Suite)]]", which topped the R&B chart in 1990, he mounted an effective comeback with several albums, each more successful than the last. He returned to the top of the charts in 1991 with the album \'\'[[Put Me in Your Mix]]\'\', which reached #8 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B Albums chart and the song by the same name reached #2 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B singles chart.

In 1994 he released \'\'[[The Icon Is Love]]\'\', which went to #1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B album charts, and the single "[[Practice What You Preach (Barry White song)|Practice What You Preach]]" gave him his first #1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B singles chart in almost 20 years. The album was nominated for a Grammy in the [[Best R&B Album]] category, but lost to [[TLC (group)|TLC]]\'s \'\'[[CrazySexyCool]]\'\'.

In 1996, White recorded the [[duet]] "[[In Your Wildest Dreams (song)|In Your Wildest Dreams]]" with [[Tina Turner]]. 1996 also saw the release of \'\'[[Space Jam]]\'\' and [[Space Jam (soundtrack)|its soundtrack]], on which White had a duet with [[Chris Rock]], called "Basketball Jones," a remake of [[Cheech & Chong]]\'s [[Basketball Jones|"Basketball Jones" from 1973]].

His final album, 1999\'s \'\'[[Staying Power (album)|Staying Power]]\'\', resulted in his last hit song "[[Staying Power (song)|Staying Power]]," which placed #45 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B charts. The single won him two [[Grammy Awards]] in the categories [[Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance]].<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/staying-power-mw0000242946/awards Staying Power \xe2\x80\x93 Barry White | Awards | AllMusic]</ref>

His autobiography, \'\'Love Unlimited\'\', written with Mark Eliot, was published in 1999 by Broadway Books.<ref>[http://www.filmbug.com/db/344905 "Barry White", FilmBug.]</ref>

==Acting career==

He appeared as himself in a couple episodes of \'\'[[The Simpsons]]\'\', and most importantly the episode "[[Whacking Day]]" in which Bart and Lisa used his famously deep [[Bass (voice type)|bass singing voice]], played through loudspeakers placed on the ground, to lull and attract snakes. White was a fan of the show, and had reportedly contacted the staff about wanting to make a guest appearance.

Their next single, "[[Dazz (song)|Dazz]]", (#3 Pop, #1 R&B) was released in 1976. The band continued to record for Bang records until 1982. Other [[chart-topper|hits]] followed: "That\'s What It\'s All About" (R&B #48) and "[[Dusic]]" (#18 Pop, #2 R&B) in 1977, and "Ain\'t Gonna Hurt Nobody" (#92 Pop, #7 R&B) in 1978. Their last [[Top 40|Top Ten]] R&B hit was "Sweat (Til You Get Wet)" in 1981.

\'\'\'The Brides of Funkenstein\'\'\' was a [[funk]] musical group originally composed of singers [[Dawn Silva]] and [[Lynn Mabry]].

==History==
Previously background singers for [[Sly & the Family Stone|Sly Stone]], Mabry and Silva joined the [[P-Funk]] collective in the mid-1970s. [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] named the group (based on a storyline and characters from the [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] album \'\'[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]\'\'). The Brides\' provided the vocals for the 1977 album \'\'[[Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs]]\'\' by P-Funk guitarist [[Eddie Hazel]]. Clinton produced the Brides\' debut album, \'\'[[Funk Or Walk]]\'\', for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1978. The album was a success, selling over three hundred thousand copies within the first week as well as winning a Record World award for best new female group.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The album charted at #7 on the R&B charts; the single "Disco To Go" was certified gold in America and reached platinum status in Europe and Asia. The duo became an opening act for [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] tours and also performed backing vocals for the ensemble itself.

Lynn Mabry left the group in 1979. Dawn Silva lead singer invited back-up "Bridesmaids" [[Sheila Horne]] and [[Jeanette McGruder]] to sing on the second Brides album, \'\'[[Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy]]\'\'. This lineup received a Cashbox Rhythm & Blues award for best new female artist, beating out [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Sister Sledge]], and [[Cheryl Lynn]]. The Brides\' second album was rated in 2001 by \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' as one of the top 50 coolest albums ever released.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The trio recorded a third album, \'\'Shadows On The Wall, Shaped Like The Hat You Wore\'\' in 1980, but the album was not released.  Most of the songs from the unreleased album gradually appeared elsewhere in the P-Funk catalog.

Lynn Mabry resurfaced in 1984 as a backing vocalist with [[Talking Heads]], appearing in the concert film \'\'[[Stop Making Sense]]\'\' along with P-Funk colleague [[Bernie Worrell]]. Silva and Mabry had a brief reunion in 1981 as the New Wave Brides, opening for [[Grace Jones]], and a lengthy tour with [[Was (Not Was)]]. Silva would tour and record with the [[Gap Band]] from 1983 to 1991, moving on to work with [[Ice Cube]]. In 2000 Silva released the solo album \'\'All My Funky Friends\'\', which received rave reviews in Europe and Asia.  Dawn Silva & The Brides continue to tour.

\'\'\'The Brothers Johnson\'\'\' is an American [[funk music|funk]] and [[R&B]] band consisting of American musicians and brothers George aka \'Lightnin\' Licks\' and [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis E. Johnson]] aka \'Thunder Thumbs\'. They achieved their greatest success from the mid-1970s to early \'80s, with three singles topping the R&B charts ("[[I\'ll Be Good to You]]", "[[Strawberry Letter 23]]", and "[[Stomp!]]").

==Background==

===Formation===
Guitarist/vocalist George and bassist/vocalist Louis formed the band Johnson Three Plus One with older brother Tommy and their cousin [[Alex Weir]] while attending school in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Richard|title=Oh Brothers!|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-338528.html|accessdate=October 15, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 15, 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://www.discomuseum.com/BrothersJohnson.html The Brother Johnson]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}} DiscoMuseum.com</ref> When they became professionals, the band backed such touring [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] acts as [[Bobby Womack]] and the [[Supremes]]. George and Louis Johnson later joined [[Billy Preston]]\'s band and wrote \'\'Music in My Life\'\' and \'\'The Kids and Me\'\' for him before leaving his group in 1973. In 1976, The Brothers covered the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]\' song, \'\'[[Hey Jude]]\'\', for the ephemeral musical documentary \'\'[[All This and World War II]]\'\'.

[[Quincy Jones]] hired them to play on his LP \'\'Mellow Madness\'\', and recorded four of their songs, including \'\'Is It Love That We\'re Missing?\'\' and \'\'Just a Taste of Me\'\'.

After touring with various artists including Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, they were hired by Quincy Jones for a tour in Japan and produced their debut album \'\'Look Out For #1\'\', released in March 1976 (#9 US) Their \'\'Right on Time\'\' album was released in May 1977 and reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 200]]. \'\'Blam!!\'\' came out in August 1978 and reached number 7 on the Billboard 200.

Two of the duo\'s songs were featured on the soundtrack of the 1976 film \'\'[[Mother, Jugs & Speed]]\'\'. The instrumental track \'\'Thunder Thumbs and Lightnin\' Licks\'\' refers to the brothers\' nicknames. \'\'Get the Funk Out Ma Face\'\' was cowritten with Quincy Jones.

Their popular album \'\'[[Light Up the Night (Brothers Johnson album)|Light Up The Night]]\'\' was released in March 1980 and rose to #5 on the Billboard 200. It was number 46 on the "Top 100 LPs of 1980" list in \'\'[[Rolling Stone Magazine]]\'\'. The brothers self-produced the subsequent album, \'\'Winners\'\'; released in July 1981, it only reached #48 on the Billboard 200.

Among their most popular songs are \'\'[[I\'ll Be Good to You]]\'\' ([[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] #3 in 1976), \'\'[[Strawberry Letter 23]]\'\' (Hot 100 #5 in 1977, originally recorded by [[Shuggie Otis]]), \'\'Ain\'t We Funkin\' Now\'\' (1978), and \'\'[[Stomp!]]\'\' (Hot 100 #7 and [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] #1 in 1980). Their styles include [[funk]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[ballad]]s. Each album also included at least one instrumental cut that would either be considered lite jazz (\'\'Tomorrow\'\' 1976, \'\'Q\'\' 1977, \'\'Smilin\' On Ya\'\' 1980, \'\'Tokyo\'\' 1984) or Funk (\'\'Thunder Thumbs &Lightning Licks\'\' 1976, \'\'Brother Man\'\' 1976, \'\'Mista Cool\'\' 1978, \'\'Celebrations\'\' 1980).

===1982 Split===
The [[duet (music)|duo]] split up in 1982 to pursue separate projects.

===Louis Johnson\'s solo work===
Louis Johnson [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a [[gospel music]] album in 1981 with his own group Passage, which included his then-wife Valerie Johnson and former Brothers Johnson percussionist/singer Richard Heath. He played bass on [[Michael Jackson]]\'s \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\'. In 1985 he recorded a single, "Kinky", on [[Capitol Records]]; it appears on his \'\'Evolution\'\' album which was exclusively released in Europe that year. Louis then made 3 instructional videotapes for the Starlicks video-distribution company in which he shared his bass-playing skills. The first was released in 1985. He then settled down to enjoy family life with his wife and son, but by 1988 his then-manager Diane Taren talked him into going back into the recording studio. He started his bass academy during the 1990s and giving workshop clinics to this day via his own Website.

===George Johnson\'s solo work===
George Johnson released one single in 1985, "Back Against The Wall," on Quincy Jones\' own [[Qwest Records|Qwest]] label. A complete album (recorded but unreleased) came from that session, as George confirmed when he and Louis were interviewed around 1987/88 for \'\'Blues & Soul Magazine\'\' in the United Kingdom (see link below). George also delivered guitar work for [[Steve Arrington]]\'s album \'\'Dancing in the Key of Life\'\' (1985) and had ad-libbed vocals on the track "Think Back And Remember" from the \'\'Galaxian\'\' album by the [[Jeff Lorber|Jeff Lorber Fusion]], released in 1981 on [[Arista Records]].

===Various 1980s reunions and other projects===
[[File:Brothers Johnson.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brothers Johnson in 1980]]
In 1984 the brothers briefly reunited in the recording studio. The resulting [[Leon Sylvers III|Leon Sylvers]]-produced [[Gramophone record|LP]], \'\'Out of Control\'\', did not equal their past success, but it did garner them another R&B [[chart-topper|hit]] with "You Keep Me Coming Back." They teamed up again in 1988 to record "Kickin\'", the title track of which was a collaboration with their then-neighbor [[Irene Cara]]. This album\'s success was even more limited, but it did include the minor hit "Kick it to the Curb."

Between the two albums, both George and Louis released their aforementioned solo material and also appeared on \'\'Street Shadows\'\', an album by keyboardist/arranger David Diggs, who had provided horn and string arrangements for \'\'Winners\'\', \'\'Blast\'\', and Louis\' \'\'Passage\'\'. "Last Night," \'\'Street\'\'s opening track, showcases George\'s bass-guitar playing. He previously showed his bass skills on tracks like "Teaser" from \'\'Winners\'\' and "The Great Awakening" from \'\'Blast\'\', the same way Louis shows his guitar skills on the duo\'s various compositions.

Also during this time, the band\'s song "Tomorrow" (originally an instrumental on the B-side of "Get The Funk Out Ma Face") was recorded with vocals by [[Tevin Campbell]] for Quincy Jones\' \'\'Back on the Block\'\' release in 1989.  This album also included Jones\' hit remake of the Brothers Johnson\'s "I\'ll Be Good to You," featuring [[Ray Charles]] and [[Chaka Khan]].

===The 2002 reunion tour===
Besides the brothers\' brief appearance in Japan around 1994 and George guest-appearing at a [[Graham Central Station]] concert in Japan (including a released double-CD), the duo launched an expanded US tour in 2002 which got positive, wide exposure. It was visited by many fans and various artists in the entertainment business.
Along with a website and discussion-forum, online visitors could share their experiences of the shows by wandering through the Land of Ladies and reliving Funkadelia\'s heyday. A few years later, a combi-release of live-CD + DVD was released under the name \'\'Strawberry Letter 23: Live\'\'.

Until recently, the brothers have been doing performances on their own. In 2006, Louis gave a duo-show with a drummer on the \'\'Poetry in Motion 1 Festival\'\' in Maryland. In late 2007 George performed with his own band at a Detroit-Festival, including a persona called [[Sir Nose]]. These days George performs with a special band, an initiative of [[Michael Henderson]] that includes [[Adina Howard]], [[Cherrelle]], [[Ray Parker Jr.]], and others.

\'\'\'Carl Carlton\'\'\' (born May 21, 1953, [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Soul (music)|soul]], and [[funk]] [[singer]] and [[songwriter]], best known for his [[hit record|hits]] "[[Everlasting Love#Carl Carlton version|Everlasting Love]]" and "[[She\'s a Bad Mama Jama (She\'s Built, She\'s Stacked)]]".

==Career==
Carlton began his career in the mid-1960s as "Little Carl" Carlton.  This was a marketing ploy to capitalize on some [[human voice|vocal]] similarities to [[Stevie Wonder]], who recorded under the name "Little Stevie Wonder" in the early 1960s.  His first recordings were for Lando Records, for which he recorded some minor local hits, including "So What" and "Don\'t You Need A Boy Like Me."  In 1968, Carlton was signed by [[Don D. Robey]] to his new label, Back Beat Records.  Shortly after signing with the label, Carlton relocated to [[Houston]], [[Texas]] to be closer to his new label.  His first single with the label, "Competition Ain\'t Nothing" became a huge hit on the UK northern soul scene after its release on the UK Action label.  Carlton finally saw major success in the United States with a [[cover version]] of [[Robert Knight (musician)|Robert Knight\'s]] "[[Everlasting Love]]."   This song went to #6 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]], and #11 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|\'\'Billboard\'\' R&B Charts]] in 1974.

Robey sold his labels to [[ABC Records]] in 1972.  Beginning in 1976, Carlton became embroiled in a [[royalties|royalty]] dispute with ABC Records that caused him to stop recording for some time.  He then signed with [[Mercury Records]] in 1977, but only released one [[single (music)|single]] on that label. Carlton was unable to land a new [[recording contract]] for several years until [[Leon Haywood]] helped him get a singles deal with [[20th Century Records]].

A Haywood-penned single, "[[She\'s A Bad Mama Jama (She\'s Built, She\'s Stacked)]]", became a major hit, peaking at #2 on the soul chart and earning Carlton a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1981/1981grammy.htm \'\'L.A. Times\'\' "The Envelope" awards database], (Accessed August 15, 2006)</ref>  in 1982. The track peaked at #34 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"She\'s a Bad Mama Jama" has since become a staple of [[compilation album]]s and [[soundtrack]]s and is often [[sampling (music)|sample]]d in [[rap music]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Carlton released several more albums in the 1980s but had only a few minor R&B hits.  After 1985\'s \'\'Private Property\'\', he did not release another album until 1994\'s \'\'Main Event\'\', which also failed to chart.

In late 2002, Carlton appeared with many R&B [[celebrity|stars]] on the "Rhythm, Love, and Soul" edition of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series \'\'American Soundtrack\'\'. His performance of "Everlasting Love" was included on the accompanying [[live album]] that was released in 2004.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387023/ \'\'American Soundtrack\'\' IMDB entry], (Accessed August 15, 2006)</ref><ref>[http://www.shoutfactory.com/selection/84/Rhythm_Love_And_Soul_Live,b3c1af6fc41afc2ddadeec8ab2cb3196.html Shout! Factory CD information], (Accessed August 15, 2006)</ref>

On August 1, 2010, Carlton released his first [[Gospel music|gospel]] single entitled: "God is Good". He is currently in the studio completing his yet to be titled new album.<ref>[http://www.cturecords.com Cturecords.com]</ref> On April 16, 2011, Carlton was nominated for a Detroit Music Award in the "Outstanding Gospel/Christian Vocalist" category.<ref>[http://www.detroitmusicawards.com/nominees.html]</ref>

\'\'\'Chaka Khan\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Yvette Marie Stevens\'\'\'; March 23, 1953) is an American [[singer-songwriter]] whose career has spanned four decades, beginning in the 1970s as the [[Frontman|frontwoman]] and focal point of the [[funk]] band [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]]. Often dubbed the "Queen of Funk", Khan has won ten Grammys and has sold an estimated 70 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedinah.com/2012/10-time-grammy-award-winning-rock-n-roll-hall-of-fame-nominee-music-legend-chaka-khan-headlines-the-biggest-lesbian-event-in-the-world-the-dinah-2012 |title=10-Time Grammy Award-Winning Rock N\xe2\x80\x99 Roll Hall of Fame Nominee Music Legend Chaka Khan Headlines the Biggest Lesbian Event in the World: The DInah 2012 &#124; The Original Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend 2014 |publisher=Thedinah.com |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>

==1953&ndash;1972: Early life==
Chaka Khan was born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953 into an artistic, bohemian household in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. She was the eldest of five children to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman, and has described her father Charles as a [[beatnik]] and her mother as \'able to do anything\'. Raised in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] area, \'an island in the middle of the madness\' of Chicago\'s rough [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] [[Public housing in the United States|housing projects]].<ref name="BBC Gilles Peterson interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04jrlw7 |accessdate=September 27, 2014|title = Words and Music with Chaka Khan|date = September 27, 2014|website = BBC 6 Music (Interview)|last = Peterson|first = Gilles}}</ref> Her sister [[Taka Boom|Yvonne]] later became a successful musician in her own right under the name [[Taka Boom]]. Her only brother, Mark, who formed the funk group [[Aurra]], also became a successful musician. She has two other sisters, Zaheva Stevens and Tammy McCrary, the latter of whom is her current manager.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451193/bio |title=Chaka Khan (I) |accessdate=August 24, 2010|website = IMDb.com}}</ref>

Chaka Khan was raised as a [[Catholic]]. She attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to jazz as a child. Khan became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] music as a pre-teen and at eleven formed her first [[girl group|all-female singing group]] the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several civil rights rallies with her father\'s second wife, Connie, a strong supporter of the movement, and joined the [[Black Panther Party]] after befriending fellow member, activist and Chicago native [[Fred Hampton]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/chaka-khan.html |title=Chaka Khan \xe2\x80\x93 Biography on Bio |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}</ref> While a member, she was given a name change to Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi by an African shaman. In 1969, she left the Panthers, dropped out of high school, having attended [[Calumet High School (Chicago)|Calumet High School]] and Kenwood High School (now [[Kenwood Academy]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsalumni.org/school/kenwood-academy-high-school |title=Kenwood Academy High School |publisher=CPSalumni.org |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> and began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]]\'s group Lyfe, which included her then boyfriend Hassan Khan, whom she would later marry.

Khan was asked to replace the late [[Baby Huey (singer)|Baby Huey]] of [[Baby Huey & the Babysitters]] after Huey\'s untimely death, in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group called [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and soon won her position in the group, replacing rock and roll singer Paulette McWilliams. The group later signed with [[ABC Records]] in 1973. Prior to Khan signing with the label, she married on-and-off boyfriend Hassan Khan, changing her stage name to \'\'\'Chaka Khan\'\'\'.

==Career==

===1973&ndash;1978: Early career with Rufus===
{{main|Rufus (band)}}
In 1973, Rufus released their [[Rufus (1973 album)|eponymous debut album]]. Despite their fiery rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s "Maybe Your Baby" from Wonder\'s acclaimed \'\'[[Talking Book]]\'\' and the modest success of the Chaka-led ballad "Whoever\'s Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)", the album failed to garner attention. That changed when Wonder himself collaborated with the group on a song he had written for Khan. That song, "[[Tell Me Something Good]]", became the group\'s breakthrough hit, reaching number-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] in 1974, later winning the group their first [[Grammy Award]]. The single\'s success and the subsequent follow-up, "[[You_Got_the_Love_(Rufus_song)|You Got the Love]]", which peaked at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, helped their second parent album, \'\'[[Rags to Rufus]]\'\', go platinum, selling over a million copies. From 1974 to 1979, Rufus released six [[RIAA|platinum-selling]] albums including \'\'[[Rufusized]]\'\', \'\'[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (album)|Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]\'\', \'\'[[Ask Rufus]]\'\', \'\'[[Street Player]]\'\' and \'\'[[Masterjam]]\'\'. Hits the group scored during this time included "[[Once You Get Started]]," "[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]," "Hollywood," "[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]," and "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]."

The band gained a reputation as a live performing act with Khan becoming the star attraction, thanks to her powerful vocals and stage attire, which sometimes included [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] garb and showing her midriff. Most of the band\'s material was written and produced by the band itself with few exceptions. Khan has also been noted for being an instrumentalist playing drums and [[Bass guitar|bass]], she also provided percussion during her tenure with Rufus. Most of her compositions were collaborations with guitarist Tony Maiden. Relations between Khan and the group, particularly between her and Andre Fischer, became stormy. Several members left with nearly every release. While Khan remained a member of the group, she signed a solo contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978. While Khan was busy at work on solo material, Rufus released three albums without her participation including 1979\'s \'\'[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]\'\', 1980\'s \'\'[[Party \'Til You\'re Broke]]\'\'  and 1983\'s \'\'[[Seal in Red]]\'\'.

===1978&ndash;1983: Early solo career and final years with Rufus===
[[File:Chaka Khan - Chaka (1978 album).jpg|thumb|183x183px|\'\'Chaka\'\' was Khan\'s first album and it was given Gold Certification by the US.]]
In 1978, [[Warner Bros. Records]] released Khan\'s solo [[Chaka (1978 album)|debut album]], which featured the crossover disco hit, "[[I\'m Every Woman]]", written for her by songwriters [[Ashford & Simpson]]. The success of the single helped the album go platinum, selling over a million copies. Khan also was a featured performer on [[Quincy Jones]]\' hit, "Stuff Like That", also released in 1978.

In 1979, Khan reunited with Rufus to collaborate on the Jones-produced \'\'[[Masterjam]]\'\', which featured their hit, "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]", which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Despite her sometimes-acrimonious relationship with some of her band mates, Khan and Maiden have maintained a friendship over the years. In 1979 she also duetted with [[Ry Cooder]] on his album \'\'[[Bop Till You Drop]]\'\'. In 1980, while Rufus released \'\'Party \'Til You\'re Broke\'\', again without Khan, she released her second solo album, \'\'[[Naughty (album)|Naughty]]\'\', which featured her on the cover with her six-year-old daughter Milini. The album yielded the minor disco hit "Clouds" and went gold.

Also in 1980, she had a cameo appearance as a church choir soloist in \'\'[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]\'\' with [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, \'\'[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]\'\' and the solo album \'\'[[What Cha\' Gonna Do for Me]]\'\'. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on [[Rick Wakeman]]\'s concept album \'\'[[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|1984]]\'\'. In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented \'\'[[Echoes of an Era]]\'\' and a more funk/pop-oriented self-titled album \'\'[[Chaka Khan (1982 album)|Chaka Khan]]\'\'. The latter album\'s track, the jazz-inflected "Bebop Medley", won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from [[Betty Carter]] who loved Khan\'s vocal scatting in the song.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r10811|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Chaka Khan : Overview )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1983, following the release of Rufus\' final studio album, \'\'Seal in Red\'\', which did not feature Khan, the singer returned with Rufus on a live album, \'\'[[Stompin\' at the Savoy - Live]]\'\', which featured the studio single, "[[Ain\'t Nobody]]", which became the group\'s final charting success reaching number 22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and number one on the Hot R&B chart, while also reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Following this release, Rufus separated for good.

===1984\xe2\x80\x931996: Solo success===
In 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, \'\'[[I Feel for You (album)|I Feel for You]]\'\'. The [[I Feel for You|title track]] was the first single released. Originally written and recorded by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] for the eponymous follow-up to his debut album \'\'[[Prince (album)|Prince]]\'\' in 1979, it had been previously recorded by [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Mary Wells]]. Khan\'s version featured a harmonica solo by [[Stevie Wonder]] and an introductory rap by [[Grandmaster Melle Mel]]. This version of the song became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and United Kingdom, and it helped to relaunch Khan\'s career. "[[I Feel For You]]" topped not only the U.S. R&B and dance charts, but achieved great success on U.S. pop charts, and reached number one in the United Kingdom as well. The song reached number three on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 in December 1984, and remained on that chart for 26 weeks, well into 1985.  Additionally, it hit #1 on the [[Cash Box]] Top 100 chart. It was listed as \'\'Billboard\'\'\xe2\x80\xb2s number 5 song for the year 1985, and netted Prince the 1985 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]]. In addition to the song\'s successful radio airplay and sales, a music video of Khan with break dancers in an inner-city setting enjoyed heavy airplay on television and helped to solidify Khan\'s notoriety in popular culture.

Other singles which helped the \'\'I Feel For You\'\' album to go [[RIAA|platinum]] included "[[This is my Night]]" and the ballad "[[Through the Fire (song)|Through the Fire]]", the latter of which was also very successful on the adult contemporary charts. Khan was featured in [[Steve Winwood]]\'s 1986 number one hit, "[[Higher Love]]". That same year, a duet was planned with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] for the song "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted To Love]]". However, her manager declined to allow the duet to be released, citing the desire to not have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time; she was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album\'s liner notes, and the song became an international hit.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wolf |first=Buck |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101024#.TrfT7LKwXAg |title=Robert Palmer Never Meant to Turn Us On \xe2\x80\x93 ABC News |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Khan followed up her successful \'\'I Feel For You\'\' album with 1986\'s \'\'[[Destiny (Chaka Khan album)|Destiny]]\'\' and 1988\'s \'\'[[CK (album)|CK]]\'\'. Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a remix album, \'\'[[Life is a Dance - The Remix Project]]\'\', which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result she performed regularly in the United Kingdom, where she maintained a strong fan base.

In 1990, she was a featured performer on another major hit when she collaborated with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Quincy Jones]] on a [[new jack swing]] cover of [[The Brothers Johnson]]\'s "[[I\'ll Be Good to You]]", which was featured on Jones\' \'\'[[Back on the Block]]\'\'. The song reached number-eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100 and number-one on the Hot R&B chart, later winning Ray Charles and Khan a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 with the release of \'\'[[The Woman I Am]]\'\', which went gold thanks to the R&B success of the songs "Love You All My Lifetime" and "You Can Make the Story Right". 

Khan also contributed to soundtracks and worked on a follow-up to \'\'The Woman I Am\'\' which she titled \'\'Dare You to Love Me\'\', which was eventually shelved. In 1995, she and rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] had a hit with the duet "Watch What You Say", in the United Kingdom. That same year, she provided a [[contemporary R&B]] cover of the classic standard, "[[My Funny Valentine]]", for the \'\'[[Waiting to Exhale (soundtrack)|Waiting to Exhale]]\'\' soundtrack. In 1996, following the release of her greatest-hits album, \'\'[[Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1]]\'\', Khan abruptly left Warner Bros. after stating the label had neglected her and failed to release \'\'Dare You to Love Me\'\'.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/301491|title=Interview, thestar.com February 9, 2008|work=thestar.com|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

===Since 1998===
In 1998, Khan signed a contract with Prince\'s [[NPG Records]] label and issued \'\'[[Come 2 My House]]\'\', followed by the single "[[Don\'t Talk 2 Strangers]]", a cover of a 1996 Prince song. Khan later went on a tour with Prince as a co-headlining act. In 2000, Khan departed from NPG and in 2004 released her first jazz covers album in twenty-two years with 2004\'s \'\'[[ClassiKhan]]\'\'. She also covered "[[Little Wing]]" with [[Kenny Olson]] on the album \'\'[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]\'\'. Three years later, after signing with [[Burgundy Records]], Khan released what many critics called a "comeback album" with \'\'[[Funk This]]\'\', produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] & Big Jim Wright
pic= 990
The album featured the hit, "Angel", and the [[Mary J. Blige]] duet, "Disrespectful". The latter track went to number one on the U.S. dance singles chart, winning the singers a Grammy Award, while \'\'Funk This\'\' also won a Grammy for Best R&B Album. The album was notable for Khan\'s covers of [[Dee Dee Warwick]]\'s "Foolish Fool" and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]\'s "[[Sign o\' the Times (song)|Sign o\' the Times]]". In 2008, Khan participated in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of \'\'[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]\'\' playing Ms. Sofia to [[Fantasia Barrino]]\'s Celie.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/theater/30mcge.html?ex=1215061200&en=660d853e43d071cd&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR&WT.mc_ev=click&mkt=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR |title=The Many Shades of Chaka Khan, Now in \xe2\x80\x98Purple\xe2\x80\x99 |work=The New York Times |author=McGee, Celia |date=December 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2008}}</ref>

In a 2008 interview Khan said that she, unlike other artists, felt very optimistic about the current changes in the recording industry, including music downloading. "I\'m glad things are shifting and artists \xe2\x80\x93 not labels \xe2\x80\x93 are having more control over their art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven\'t seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]\'s original recording of \'[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]\' \xe2\x80\x93 which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now."<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers [[Anastacia]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] for [[Here Come the Girls (concert tour)|Here Come the Girls]].

In 2009, Chaka was guest singer with the song "Alive"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKg-ZpXxwvc&feature=fvwrel |title=CHAKA KHAN - BILLY COBHAM - GINO VANNELLI I - Drum \'n\' voice vol.3 (produced by Nicolosi / Novecento) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> on [[Billy Cobham]]\'s album \'\'Drum \' n voice 3\'\'. In 2010, she contributed to vocals for [[Beverley Knight]]\'s "[[Soul Survivor (Beverley Knight song)|Soul Survivor]]", collaborated with [[Clay Aiken]] on a song for the kids show \'\'[[Phineas and Ferb]]\'\', and performed two songs with Japanese singer [[Ai (singer)|Ai]] on Ai\'s latest album \'\'The Last Ai\'\'. Khan continues to perform to packed audiences both in her native United States and overseas.

On May 19, 2011, Khan was given the 2,440th [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star plaque on a section of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her family was present when the singer accepted the honor, as was [[Stevie Wonder]], who had written her breakout hit "[[Tell Me Something Good]]". On September 27, 2011, the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that Khan and her former band [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] were jointly nominated for induction to the hall. It was the collective\'s first nomination 13 years after they were first eligible. The group were nominated partly due to Khan\'s own storied reputation, including her own solo career in conjunction with her years with Rufus. Recently, Khan rerecorded her song, "Super Life", under the title "Super Life: Fear Kills, Love Heals" with [[Eric Benet]], [[Kelly Price]], and [[Luke James]] in tribute to [[Trayvon Martin]], a teenager who was killed on February 26. A number of celebrities also joined in the recording including [[Loretta Devine]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Eva Pigford]], and reporter [[Kevin Frazier]].

On July 27, 2013, Khan was honored forty years after signing her first recording contract with a ceremonial renaming of Blackstone Avenue between 50th and 51st street (where her former high school, Kenwood Academy, sits) as Chaka Khan Way and on July 28 the city declared the day Chaka Khan Day. She performed at [[Millennium Park]]\'s [[Pritzker Pavilion]] on the 28th.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/07/29/5605721/the-city-of-chicago-honors-ten.html|title=The City of Chicago Honors Ten-Time GRAMMY\xc2\xae Award Winner Chaka Khan with Street Naming|accessdate=July 31, 2013|date=July 29, 2013|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|author=Khan, Chaka|agency=[[PR Newswire]]}}</ref> Khan is working on her new album called \'\'iKhan\'\' which is said to be released in 2014.

==Personal life==
Khan has been married twice and is the mother of two children, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan, in 1970, when she was 17. They divorced a short time later. Milini\'s birth was the result of a relationship between Khan and Rahsaan Morris.<ref name="imdb" /> Khan married her second husband, Richard Holland, in 1976. The marriage reportedly caused a rift between Khan and several members of Rufus, in particular, Andre Fischer. Khan dated a Chicago-area schoolteacher in the mid-1980s in the middle of her solo stardom. Following their separation, Khan moved to Europe, first settling in [[London, England|London]], later buying a residence in Germany.

Khan is [[vegan]], saying she adopted the diet to lose weight and combat high blood pressure and [[Type-2 diabetes]].<ref>Brennan Williams, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/18/chaka-khan-weight-loss-new-music-sex-symbol_n_1606606.html "Chaka Kahn Opens Up on Weight Loss, New Music, Being a Sex Symbol"], \'\'Huffington Post\'\', June 21, 2012.</ref> In the past, Khan struggled with [[drug abuse]] and [[alcoholism]]. Her drug use, which at times included [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], ended in the early 1990s. Khan had an on-and-off struggle with alcoholism until 2005 declaring herself [[sobriety|sober]]. In 2006, her son Damien Holland was accused of murder after 17-year-old Christopher Bailey was shot to death. Khan testified on her son\'s behalf defending her son\'s innocence. Holland claimed the shooting was an accident and was found not guilty.<ref name="Arnold 2007 115\xe2\x80\x93117">{{cite news | first = Chuck | last = Arnold | title = Chaka Khan Through the Fire | year = 2007 | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] | url = http://web.ebscohost.com.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&hid=9&sid=38820f2a-6b88-44ac-bc73-cbeeda037cf0%40sessionmgr14&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a2h&AN=27180285 | pages = 115\xe2\x80\x93117 | accessdate = May 18, 2010}}</ref> Though she sang at both the 2000 Democratic and Republican conventions, Khan says that she is more of a "Democratic-minded person".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046343|title=Chaka Khan Siding with the Democratic Ticket|date=November 6, 2006|author=Rosen, Craig}}</ref>

In December 2011, Khan won permanent custody of her granddaughter, Daija Jade Holland, after reporting that Daija\'s mother, the girlfriend of Khan\'s son Damien Holland, was unable to raise her due to her [[drug addiction]]. It was reported that Khan\'s son was also addicted to drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.essence.com/2011/12/16/chaka-khan-awarded-custody-of-granddaughter/|title=Chaka Khan Awarded Custody of Granddaughter|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref>

Khan was featured in a 2013 episode of \'\'[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]\'\' where she told the story of a \'shadow man\' that followed her on tour for years until she met a guardian angel who admonished her to change her life or die.<ref>Celebrity Ghost Stories, 2013.</ref>

\'\'\'Chic\'\'\' ({{IPAc-en|\xcb\x88|\xca\x83|i\xcb\x90|k}} {{respell|SHEEK|\'}}; currently \'\'\'Chic featuring Nile Rodgers\'\'\') is an American band that was organized during 1976 by guitarist [[Nile Rodgers]] and bassist [[Bernard Edwards]]. Its commercially successful [[disco]] songs include "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)]]" (1977), "[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]" (1977), "[[Le Freak]]" (1978), "[[I Want Your Love (Chic song)|I Want Your Love]]" (1978), "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]" (1979), and "[[My Forbidden Lover]]" (1979). The group regarded themselves as a rock band for the disco movement "that made good on hippie peace, love and freedom".<ref name=Christgau>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/books/review/le-freak-an-upside-down-story-of-family-disco-and-destiny-by-nile-rodgers-book-review.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2 The Rock Days of Disco] by [[Robert Christgau]] for The New York Times December 2, 2011</ref> In October 2014, Chic was nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] for the tenth time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-nine-inch-nails-smiths-nominated-for-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-20141009|title=Green Day, NIN, the Smiths Nominated for Rock Hall of Fame - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=December 21, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
===1970\xe2\x80\x9378: Origins and early singers===
[[File:Chicguilfest.JPG|thumb|200px|right|upright=2.5|Chic at [[Guilfest]] 2012]]
Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards met during 1970, as fellow session musicians working in the New York City area. They formed a rock band named \'The Boys\' and later \'The Big Apple Band,\' playing numerous gigs around New York City.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book

They were in a band, NEW YORK CITY which had a hit record in 1973 with \'"I\'m Doing Fine Now" which charted in the UK. The original demo tapes were made by DJ/studio engineer Robert Drake, who first played [[Acetate disc|lacquer records]] while DJing at a New York after hours club, Night Owl. The title of the first song recorded as Chic was "[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]," which was on their first album.

During 1977, Edwards and Rodgers recruited drummer [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]], formerly with [[Labelle|LaBelle]] and Ecstasy, Passion, & Pain, to join the band; they performed as a trio doing [[cover song|cover versions]] at various gigs.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Thompson recommended keyboardist Raymond Jones, 19, to join the band, as he had worked with him in the hit group Ecstasy, Passion & Pain. Needing a singer to become a full band, they engaged [[Norma Jean Wright]] by an agreement permitting her to have a solo career in addition to her work for the band.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Using a young [[recording engineer]] [[Bob Clearmountain]], they created the tracks "[[Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)]]". As a result, Chic became a support act.

Under contract with [[Atlantic Records]] company, during 1977 they released the self-titled debut album \'\'[[Chic (album)|Chic]],\'\' which was an extension of the demonstration tape. But Edwards and Rodgers were convinced that to produce the band\'s recording studio sound when performing live with sound and visuals, they needed to add another female singer. Wright suggested her friend Luci Martin, who became a member during late winter/early spring of 1978.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Soon after the sessions ended for the debut album, the band members began to work on Wright\'s self-titled debut solo album \'\'[[Norma Jean (album)|Norma Jean]]\'\', released during 1978. This album included the successful nightclub song "Saturday."  To facilitate Wright\'s solo career, the band had agreed to contract her with a separate record company.

The legal details of this contract eventually forced Wright to end her relationship with the band during mid-1978, but she participated in the sessions for Chic-produced [[Sister Sledge]] album, \'\'[[We Are Family (album)|We Are Family]]\'\'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> She was replaced as a singer by Alfa Anderson, who had done back-up vocals on the band\xe2\x80\x99s debut album. For the Sister Sledge project, Edwards and Rodgers wrote and produced "He\'s the Greatest Dancer" (originally intended to be a Chic song), in exchange for "[[I Want Your Love (Chic song)|I Want Your Love]]" (intended originally to be performed by Sister Sledge).

===1978\xe2\x80\x9379: "Le Freak" and "Good Times"===
The group endeavored to express "deep hidden meaning" in every song they wrote.<ref name=Christgau/> During late 1978, the band released the album \'\'[[C\'est Chic]]\'\', containing one of its better-known tracks, "[[Le Freak]]." It was created in a jam session in Edwards\' [[apartment]], after they had failed on [[New Years Eve]] 1977 to meet with [[Grace Jones]] at New York\'s nightclub [[Studio 54]]. The original refrain "Aaa, fuck off", intended for the doormen of Studio 54, was replaced that night with "Aaa, freak out," after trying a version with "Aaa, freak off."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr05/articles/classictracks.htm|title=CLASSIC TRACKS: Chic \'Le Freak\'|publisher=Sound on Sound|date=April 2005|accessdate=October 12, 2008}}</ref> The resulting single was a great success, scoring No. 1 on the US charts<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and selling more than six million copies. It was the best-selling single album ever of Atlantic\'s parent company, Warner Music, until [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\'s "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]" in 1990.

The next year, the group released the \'\'[[Risqu\xc3\xa9 (album)|Risqu\xc3\xa9]]\'\' album and the lead track "[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]", one of the most influential songs of the era. The track was the basis of [[Grandmaster Flash]]\'s "Adventures on the Wheels of Steel" and the [[Sugarhill Gang]]\'s breakthrough [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] music single, "[[Rapper\'s Delight]]." It has been sampled since by many dance and hip-hop acts, as well as being the inspiration for [[Queen (band)|Queen]]\'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]\'s "[[Rapture (song)|Rapture]]", [[Captain Sensible]]\'s "Wot?" and the bass line for [[Daft Punk]] "Around the World".

At the same time, Edwards and Rodgers composed, arranged, performed, and produced many influential disco and [[Rhythm & Blues]] records for various artists, including [[Sister Sledge]]\'s albums \'\'[[We Are Family (album)|We Are Family]]\'\' (1979) and \'\'[[Love Somebody Today]]\'\' (1980); [[Sheila (and) B. Devotion|Sheila and B. Devotion]]\'s "Spacer"; [[Diana Ross]]\'s 1980 album \'\'[[Diana (album)|Diana]]\'\', which included the successful singles "Upside Down", "I\'m Coming Out" and "My Old Piano"; [[Carly Simon]]\'s "[[Why (Carly Simon song)|Why]]" (from 1982 soundtrack  \'\'[[Soup For One (film)|Soup For One]]\'\'); and [[Debbie Harry]]\'s debut solo album \'\'[[KooKoo]]\'\'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> An album recorded with [[Johnny Mathis]] was rejected by his label and remains unreleased. 

Chic also introduced a young session vocalist, [[Luther Vandross]], who sang on Chic\'s early albums. He later became notable in his own right.

=== 1980s\xe2\x80\x931990s: Disbanding, other projects, a brief reunion ===
After the [[Disco Sucks|anti-disco reaction]] of the 1970s, the band struggled to obtain both airplay and sales, and during the early 1980s they disbanded. Rodgers and Edwards produced records for a variety of artists together and separately. The Chic rhythm section of Rodgers, Edwards, and Thompson provided instrumental back-up for the successful album \'\'[[Diana (album)|Diana]]\'\' for [[Diana Ross]] that ended up selling over ten million albums internationally during 1980, with Rodgers and Edwards producing. It yielded the four weeks at number-one single "[[Upside Down]]" and the top ten song "[[I\'m Coming Out]]." "My Old Piano" was also a top ten single for Ross in the United Kingdom. Rodgers co-produced [[David Bowie]]\'s 1983 album \'\'[[Let\'s Dance (David Bowie album)|Let\'s Dance]]\'\' and was also responsible largely for the early success of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] during 1984 with her \'\'[[Like a Virgin]]\'\' album, which again reunited Rodgers, Thompson, and Edwards, with keyboardist Rob Sabino and collaborators Jeff Bova and Jimmy Bralower. During 1984, Rodgers was involved with a project of the band [[The Honeydrippers]] and helped produce that band\'s only EP.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Thompson and Edwards worked with the group [[Power Station (band)|Power Station]] on its successful 1985 album, as well as Power Station main singer [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]\'s solo success \'\'[[Riptide (album)|Riptide]]\'\' that same year, both of which Edwards produced. 1985 saw Rodgers producing the [[Thompson Twins]] successful \'\'[[Here\'s To Future Days]]\'\' album, and appearing live with them and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at [[Live Aid]] in Philadelphia. During 1986, Rodgers produced the fourth album from [[Duran Duran]], \'\'[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]\'\'. Bernard Edwards later gave Duran Duran\'s bassist John Taylor the bass guitar he\'d played on many of Chic\'s songs.  Taylor had long been a Chic fan, his style influenced greatly by Edwards\' playing.

After a 1989 birthday party where Rodgers, Edwards, [[Paul Shaffer]], and [[Anton Fig]] played old Chic songs, Rodgers and Edwards organized a reunion of the old band.  They recorded new material - a single, "[[Chic Mystique]]" (remixed by [[Masters at Work]]) and subsequent album \'\'[[Chic-Ism]]\'\', both of which charted\xe2\x80\x94- and played live all over the world, to great audience and critical acclaim.

During 1996, Rodgers was honored as the Top Producer in the World in \'\'[[Billboard Magazine]]\'\', and was named a JT Super Producer. That year, he performed with Bernard Edwards, Sister Sledge, [[Steve Winwood]], [[Simon Le Bon]], and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in a series of commemorative concerts in Japan. His longtime musical partner Edwards died of [[pneumonia]] at age 43 during the trip on April 18, 1996. His final performance was recorded and released as \'\'[[Live at the Budokan (Chic)|Live at the Budokan]]\'\'. Chic continued to tour with new musicians.

Thompson died of kidney cancer on November 12, 2003 at age 48.

A box set, \'\'Nile Rodgers Presents The Chic Organization, Vol.1: Savoir Faire\'\' was released in 2010, covering Rodgers and Edwards\' productions both for Chic and for other artists up to the original break-up of the partnership in 1983.

In October 2010, Rodgers began his fight with [[prostate cancer]]. In October 2011, he released his autobiography entitled \'\'Le Freak: An Upside Down Story of Family, Disco, and Destiny\'\'.<ref name=Christgau/> On July 29, 2013, Rodgers posted on [[Twitter]] that he was cancer free.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ferreira|first=Sky|url=https://twitter.com/nilerodgers/status/361882306555830272/photo/1|title=Instead of showing\xe2\x80\xa6|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, CHIC ft. Nile Rodgers headlined the West Holts Stage on Friday night at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in the UK, and played a variety of tracks both from Chic and from Nile Rodgers\' extensive list of songs he had worked on for other artists.  "My favorite act at this year\xe2\x80\x99s Glastonbury, when I went, was not the Rolling Stones, as great as they were; was not the Arctic Monkeys, as good as they were; was not Disclosure, as good as they were; but it was Chic.

Rodgers announced in 2013 that he was working on a new Chic album, based on recently rediscovered tapes of unreleased material from the early 1980s. He also stated that [[Daft Punk]] is interested in working on at least one song of the unreleased material with him.  Rodgers co-wrote and performed on three songs off [[Daft Punk]]\'s 2013 Grammy Award winning Album of the Year \'\'[[Random Access Memories]]\'\' including the Grammy Record of the Year [[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]] with the duo and [[Pharrell Williams]].

The upcoming album is set to feature collaborations from the [[David Guetta]] and [[Avicii]]. Rodgers described how a lick he played to test a freshly-repaired guitar caught the ear of DJ [[Nicky Romero]], ending as an important part of a "huge song" on the upcoming album. Rodgers assumed "It sounds like a pop record".<ref name="Chich-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/code/5894015/nile-rodgers-talks-new-chic-album-premieres-solo-track-in-google|title=Nile Rodgers Talks New Chic Album, Premieres Solo Track in Google Hangout: Watch|author=Billboard Staff|work=Billboard|publisher=Proemtheus Global Media|date=February 5, 2014|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref>

==Influences and awards==
Chic influenced the vocal and music style of the Italian-American disco band [[Change (band)|Change]], which had a series of successes during the early 1980s. Interestingly the two acts also had a couple things in common; Chic alumnus Vandross was also Change\'s vocalist upon the latter\'s formation, and like Chic, were also signed to Atlantic through its distributed RFC label.

In addition to refining a relatively minimalist disco sound, Chic helped to inspire other artists to create their own sound. For example, [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used "Good Times" as the basis for its success "[[Rapper\'s Delight]]", which helped initiate the [[hip-hop music|hip hop]] recorded music format as we know today. "Good Times" was used also by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] on its hit "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel|..On the Wheels of Steel]]," which was used in the end sequence of the first hip-hop movie, \'\'[[Wild Style]]\'\', from 1982. [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]\'s 1980 US number-one song "[[Rapture (song)|Rapture]]" was not only influenced by "Good Times" but was a direct tribute to Chic, and main singer [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]]\'s 1981 debut solo album \'\'[[Koo Koo]]\'\' was produced by Edwards and Rodgers.

Chic was cited as an influence by the majority of successful bands from Great Britain during the 1980s. [[John Taylor (bass guitarist)|John Taylor]], the bassist from [[Duran Duran]] claims the bass part of their top 10 single "[[Rio (song)|Rio]]" was influenced by Edwards\' work with Chic.<ref>Classic Albums episode</ref> Even [[Johnny Marr]] of [[The Smiths]] has cited the group as a formative influence. Rodgers guitar work has been so emulated as to become commonplace, and Edwards\' lyrical bass is also much-cited in music circles, as is Thompson\'s recorded drumwork. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] got the inspiration for its single "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]" from Bernard Edwards\' familiar bass guitar riff on "Good Times" after [[John Deacon]] met the band in [[Avatar Studios|The Power Station]] recording studio. (Source: "Everybody Dance: Chic and the Politics of Disco")

The French duo [[Modjo]] used the guitar sample from Chic\'s "Soup for One", as the basic theme for their single, "[[Lady (Hear Me Tonight)]]".

On September 19, 2005, the group was honored at the [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]] ceremony in New York when they were inducted in three categories: 1) Artist Inductees, 2) Record Inductees for "Good Times," and 3) Producers Inductees, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards.

Throughout 2011, the song "Funny Bone" could be heard quite often as the bumper music on the Rush Limbaugh show. Bumper music is snippets of songs to segue commercial slots.

\'\'\'Curtis Lee Mayfield\'\'\' (June 3, 1942 \xe2\x80\x93 December 26, 1999) was an African American [[soul music|soul]], [[R&B]], and [[funk]] singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, who was one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious [[African-American music]].<ref name=HallOfFame>[http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=150 Curtis Mayfield], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. "\xe2\x80\xa6significant for the forthright way in which he addressed issues of black identity and self-awareness. \xe2\x80\xa6left his imprint on the Seventies by couching social commentary and keenly observed black-culture archetypes in funky, danceable rhythms. \xe2\x80\xa6sounded urgent pleas for peace and brotherhood over extended, cinematic soul-funk tracks that laid out a fresh musical agenda for the new decade."

Accessed on line November 28, 2006.</ref> He first achieved success and recognition with [[the Impressions]] during the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1950s and 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist.

Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], Mayfield started his musical career in a [[gospel music|gospel]] choir. Moving to [[North Side, Chicago|Chicago\'s North Side]] he met [[Jerry Butler]] in 1956 at the age of 14, and joined vocal group [[the Impressions]].  As a songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music.  In 1965, he wrote "[[People Get Ready]]" for the Impressions, which displayed his more politically charged songwriting.

After leaving the Impressions in 1970 in the pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums, including the soundtrack for the [[blaxploitation]] film \'\'[[Super Fly]]\'\' in 1972. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on \'\'Rolling Stone\'\'\'s list of [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/curtis-mayfield-superfly-20120524|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]], [[New York]] on August 13, 1990.

He continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album \'\'[[New World Order (album)|New World Order]]\'\' in 1997.  Mayfield won a [[Grammy Legend Award]] in 1994 and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1995, and was a double inductee into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as a member of the Impressions in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist.  He was also a two-time [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] inductee.  He died from complications of [[diabetes]] in 1999 at the age of 57.

==Early life==
Curtis Mayfield was born on 3 June 1942, in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Marion Washington and Kenneth Mayfield.<!--Most reliable sources give Kenneth Mayfield as the name of the father; some others give Curtis Lee Mayfield or Kenneth Washington, though the majority, and the main sources, use Kenneth Mayfield  --><ref name=Chicago>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qojgLBuEFEUC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Chicago Portraits|page=208|author=June Skinner Sawyers|publisher=Northwestern University Press|date= 31 Mar 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y5uyLgEfk34C&pg=PT30#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=30|title=Higher Ground|author=Craig Werner|publisher=Random House|date= 18 Dec 2007}}</ref> Mayfield\'s father left the family when Mayfield was five;<ref name=Chicago/> his mother moved the family into various Chicago projects before settling at [[Cabrini\xe2\x80\x93Green]] when Mayfield reached his teenage years. Mayfield attended [[Wells Community Academy High School]]. His mother taught him the piano, and encouraged him to enjoy gospel music; when he was seven he was a singer with the gospel quintet, the Northern Jubilee Gospel Singers.<ref name=georgia/> When he was 14 years old he formed the Alphatones; when he was 15 he joined his school friend Jerry Butler\'s group the Roosters with Arthur and Richard Brooks;<ref name=Africana>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TMZMAgAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA773#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|page=773|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2005|author=Kwame Anthony Appiah}}</ref> this group would become the Impressions four years later.<ref name= BBC>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/579113.stm|title=Soul icon Curtis Mayfield dies|date=27 December 1999|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

==The Impressions==
{{Main|The Impressions}}

Mayfield\'s career began in 1956 when he joined the Roosters with Arthur and Richard Brooks and [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]].<ref name= BBC/> Two years later the Roosters, now including [[Sam Gooden]], became the Impressions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/579113.stm Soul icon Curtis Mayfield dies], BBC News, December 27, 1999. Accessed on line November 28, 2006.</ref> The band had two hit singles with Butler, "For Your Precious Love" and "Come Back My Love", then Butler left. Mayfield temporarily went with him, co-writing and performing on Butler\'s next hit, "He Will Break Your Heart", before returning to the Impressions with the group signing for ABC Records and working with the label\'s Chicago-based producer/A&R manager, Johnny Pate.<ref name=boz>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/curtis-mayfield-20110420|author=[[Boz Scaggs]]|title=100 Greatest Artists: 98 Curtis Mayfield|publisher=\'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\'}}</ref> 

Butler was replaced by [[Fred Cash]], a returning original Roosters member, and Mayfield became lead singer, frequently composing for the band, starting with "[[Gypsy Woman (The Impressions song)|Gypsy Woman]]", a Top 20 Pop hit.  Their hit "Amen" (Top 10), an updated version of an old [[gospel music|gospel]] tune, was included in the soundtrack of the [[1963 in film|1963]] [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] film \'\'[[Lilies of the Field (1963 film)|Lilies of the Field]]\'\', which starred [[Sidney Poitier]]. The Impressions reached the height of their popularity in the mid-to-late-\'60s with a string of Mayfield compositions that included "[[Keep on Pushing]]," "[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]", "[[It\'s All Right]]" (Top 10), the uptempo "Talking about My Baby"(Top 20) and "Woman\'s Got Soul".

He formed his own label, Curtom Records in Chicago in 1968 and the Impressions joined him to continue their run of hits including "Fool For You," "This is My Country", "Choice Of Colors" and "Check Out Your Mind."  Mayfield had written much of the soundtrack of the [[civil rights movement]] in the early 1960s, but by the end of the decade, he was a pioneering voice in the [[black pride]] movement along with [[James Brown]] and [[Sly Stone]]. Mayfield\'s "[[We\'re a Winner]]" was their last major hit for ABC. A Number 1 soul hit which also reached the \'\'Billboard\'\' pop Top 20, it became an anthem of the [[black power]] and black pride movements when it was released in late 1967,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562631/bio Curtis Mayfield biography], Internet Movie Database (IMDB).

Accessed November 28, 2006.</ref>

Mayfield was a prolific songwriter in Chicago even outside his work for the Impressions, writing and producing scores of hits for many other artists. He also owned the Mayfield and Windy C labels which were distributed by [[Cameo-Parkway]], and was a partner in the [[Curtom]] (first independent, then distributed by Buddah then Warner Bros and finally RSO) and Thomas labels (first independent, then distributed by Atlantic, then independent again and finally Buddah).

Among Mayfield\'s greatest songwriting successes were three hits that he wrote for Jerry Butler on Vee Jay ("He Will Break Your Heart", "Find Another Girl" and "I\'m A-Tellin\' You").  His harmony vocals are very prominent.  He also had great success writing and arranging Jan Bradley\'s "Mama Didn\'t Lie".  Starting in 1963, he was heavily involved in writing and arranging for OKeh Records (with Carl Davis producing), which included hits by Major Lance, Walter Jackson, Billy Butler and the Artistics.  This arrangement ran through 1965.

==Solo career==

In 1970, Mayfield left the Impressions and began a solo career. Curtom released many of Mayfield\'s 1970s records, as well as records by the Impressions, [[Leroy Hutson]], [[the Five Stairsteps]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Linda Clifford]] and [[Baby Huey and the Babysitters]], a group which at one time included [[Chaka Khan]]. Gene Chandler and Major Lance, who had worked with Mayfield during the 1960s, also signed for short stays at Curtom. Many of the label\'s recordings were produced by Mayfield.

The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with \'\'[[Super Fly (soundtrack)|Super Fly]]\'\', the soundtrack to the [[blaxploitation]] [[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]] film. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably [[Isaac Hayes]]\' score for \'\'[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]\'\'), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield\'s [[lyrics]] consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban [[ghetto]]s at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine in 1972 that while the film\'s message "was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes" because it "glamorizes [[machismo]]-[[cocaine]] consciousness... the anti-drug message on [Mayfield\'s soundtrack] is far stronger and more definite than in the film." 

Along with [[Marvin Gaye]]\'s \'\'[[What\'s Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What\'s Going On]]\'\' and [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s \'\'[[Innervisions]]\'\', this album ushered in a new [[social consciousness|socially conscious]], [[funk music|funky]] style of popular [[soul music]]. He was dubbed \'The Gentle Genius\' to reflect his outstanding and innovative musical output with the constant presence of his soft yet insistent vocals. The single releases "[[Freddie\'s Dead]]" and "[[Superfly (song)|Super Fly]]" both sold over one million copies each, and were awarded [[music recording sales certification|gold discs]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]]<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book| author= Joseph Murrells | year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| page= 316| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}</ref>

\'\'Super Fly\'\' brought success that resulted in Mayfield being tapped for additional soundtracks, some of which he wrote and produced while having others perform the vocals. [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]] recorded Mayfield\'s soundtrack for \'\'[[Claudine (movie)|Claudine]]\'\' in 1974, while [[Aretha Franklin]] recorded the soundtrack for \'\'[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]\'\' in 1976. Mayfield also worked with [[The Staple Singers]] on the soundtrack for the 1975 film \'\'[[Let\'s Do It Again (1975 film)|Let\'s Do It Again]]\'\', and teamed up with [[Mavis Staples]] exclusively on the 1977 film soundtrack \'\'[[A Piece of the Action (film)|A Piece of the Action]]\'\' (both movies were part of a trilogy of films that featured the acting and comedic exploits of [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] and were directed by [[Poitier]]).

One of Mayfield\'s most successful funk-disco meldings was the 1977 hit "Do Do Wap is Strong in Here" from his [[Short Eyes (album)|soundtrack]] to the [[Robert M. Young (film director)|Robert M. Young]] film of [[Miguel Pi\xc3\xb1ero]]\'s play \'\'[[Short Eyes (play)|Short Eyes]]\'\'. In his 2003 biography of Curtis Mayfield, titled "People Never Give Up",  author Peter Burns noted that Curtis has 140 songs in the [[Curtom]] vaults. Burns indicated that the songs maybe already completed or in the stages of completion, so that they could then be released commercially. These recordings include "The Great Escape", "In The News", "Turn up the Radio", "What\'s The Situation?" and one recording labelled "Curtis at Montreux Jazz Festival 87". Two other albums featuring Curtis Mayfield present in the Curtom vaults and as yet unissued are a 1982/83 live recording titled "25th Silver Anniversary" (which features performances by Curtis, The Impressions and [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]]) and a live performance, recorded in September 1966 by the Impressions titled \'Live at the Club Chicago\'.

In 1980, Mayfield decided to move to Atlanta with his family, closing down his recording operation in Chicago and effectively ending the era of the Chicago soul sound. The label had gradually reduced in size in its final two years or so with releases on the main RSO imprint and Curtom credited as the production company. Mayfield continued to record occasionally, keeping the Curtom name alive for a few more years, and to tour worldwide.

In later years, Mayfield\'s music would be included in the movies \'\'[[I\'m Gonna Git You Sucka]]\'\', \'\'[[Hollywood Shuffle]]\'\', \'\'[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]\'\' (though not on the soundtrack), The Hangover Part II and [[Short Eyes (film)|Short Eyes]] (1977) where he had a cameo role as a prisoner.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fVF58UFjlysC&pg=PA94#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Only the Strong Survive: Memoirs of a Soul Survivor|first=Jerry  |last=Butler |page=94|publisher=Indiana University Press|year= 2004  |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Social activism==

Curtis Mayfield was known for introducing social consciousness into black music as well as [[R&B]] and wrote songs protesting social and political inequality. He wrote and recorded the soundtrack to the 1972 [[blaxploitation]] film \'\'[[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]]\'\' with [[the Impressions]]. \'\'Super Fly\'\' is regarded as an all-time great body of work that influenced many and truly invented a new style of modern black music. Just as the Civil Rights Act passed into law in 1964, his group the Impressions produced music that became the soundtrack to a summer of revolution. Black students sang their songs as they marched to jail or protested outside their universities, while King often marched to the peaceful sounds of Mayfield\'s "Keep On Pushing", "People Get Ready" and "We\'re A Winner". Mayfield had quickly become a civil rights hero.<ref name=Freeland>{{cite journal|last=Freeland|first=Gregory|title=\'We\'re a Winner\': Popular Music and the Black Power Movement|journal=Social Movement Studies|year=2009|volume=8|issue=3|pages=261\xe2\x80\x93288|accessdate=October 13, 2011|doi=10.1080/14742830903024358}}</ref>

Mayfield, along with several other soul and funk musicians, spread messages of hope in the face of oppression, pride in being a member of the black race and gave courage to a generation who were demanding their human rights. He has been compared to [[Martin Luther King Jr]] arguably for making a greater lasting impact in the civil rights struggle with his music.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} By the end of the decade Mayfield was a pioneering voice in the black pride movement, along with James Brown and Sly Stone. Paving the way for a future generation of rebel thinkers, Mayfield paid the price, artistically and commercially, for his politically charged music. Irrespective of the persistent radio bans and loss of revenue, he continued his quest for equality right until his death. His lyrics on racial injustice, poverty and drugs became the poetry for a generation.
Mayfield was also a descriptive social commentator. As the influx of drugs ravaged through black America in the late 1960s and 1970s his bittersweet descriptions of the ghetto would serve as warnings to the impressionable. Determined to warn all about the perils of drugs, "Freddie\'s Dead" is a graphic tale of street life.<ref name=Freeland /> In 1965, another gospel song emerged \xe2\x80\x93 "[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]" by Mayfield and the Impressions. "[[Keep On Pushing]]" and "People Get Ready" were two songs that became embedded in the national movement for civil and social rights, heard at all the rallies and marches, songs-as-inspiration.

==Later years and death==

Mayfield remained active in the 1970s. Then his output began to slow during the 1980s. 

On August 13, 1990, he became paralyzed from the neck down, after stage lighting equipment fell on him at an outdoor concert at Wingate Field in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], [[Brooklyn]], New York.<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years">{{cite book| author= John Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd
| page= 473| id= CN 5585}}</ref> Afterwards, though he was unable to play guitar, he continued to compose and sing. And, he directed the recording of his last album, \'\'New World Order\'\'. 

Mayfield\'s vocals were painstakingly recorded, usually line-by-line, while lying on his back.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Music World Mourns Death of Curtis Mayfiel|journal= Jet|issue=Vol. 97, No. 6   |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|date=January 17, 2000 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}</ref>

Curtis received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1995. In February 1998, he had to have his right leg [[amputated]] because of [[diabetes]]. Mayfield was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 1999.  Health reasons prevented him from attending the ceremony, which included fellow inductees [[Paul McCartney]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[George Martin]], and 1970s Curtom signee and labelmate [[the Staple Singers]].

His last appearance on record was with the group [[Bran Van 3000]] on the song "[[Astounded]]" for their album \'\'[[Discosis]]\'\', recorded just before his death and released in 2001.

Curtis Mayfield died from complications of diabetes on December 26, 1999, at the North Fulton Regional Hospital in [[Roswell, Georgia]]; his health having steadily declined following his paralysis.<ref name="JetMagazine2000">{{cite book|title=Jet|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZTsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA55|accessdate=January 18, 2011|date=January 17, 2000|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=55|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>

==Legacy==

Mayfield was among the first of a new wave of mainstream black [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] performing artists and composers injecting [[social commentary]] into their work.<ref name=HallOfFame /> This "message music" became extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s.

Mayfield taught himself how to play guitar, tuning it to the black keys of the piano, giving the guitar an open F-sharp tuning that he used throughout his career.<ref name=georgia>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/curtis-mayfield-1942-1999|author=Ian Hill|title= Curtis Mayfield (1942-1999)|publisher= New Georgia Encyclopedia|date= 25 March 2013}}</ref><ref>Carpenter, Bill. \'\'Uncloudy Days: The Gospel Music Encyclopedia\'\', p. 273.

\'\'\'Dynasty\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[musical ensemble|band]], based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], created by [[record producer|producer]] and [[SOLAR Records]] [[record label|label]] head [[Dick Griffey]], and record producer [[Leon Sylvers III]]. The band was known for their [[dance music|dance]]/[[pop music|pop]] numbers during the late 1970s and 1980s. Keyboardist Kevin Spencer and [[singer|vocalists]] Nidra Beard and Linda Carriere originally comprised the group.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref>

==History==
Dynasty was essentially the brainchild of Griffey and producer Sylvers- a former member of the [[The Sylvers|Sylvers]] family group- who had achieved much popularity in the early to mid-1970s. A principal architect of the [[SOLAR Records|SOLAR]] sound, Sylvers had become the in-house producer in 1978 for the label (whose name stood for "Sound Of Los Angeles Records\') and it was in this capacity that he brought the members of Dynasty together. The group consisted of three young performers; vocalists Nidra Beard, Linda Carriere and keyboardist Kevin Spencer.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/>

Beard and Carriere first became friends during the winter of 1972, when Carriere moved from [[New Orleans]] for college.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> Both were frequent visitors to \'Maverick\'s Flat\', a popular soul/pop [[nightclub]] in Los Angeles. The owner of Maverick\'s Flat, [[John Daniels (actor)|John Daniels]], was in the process of putting together a new group \'DeBlanc\' and both young singers became members.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> For two years, they toured with the DeBlanc, throughout the major cities of Europe, Japan, Canada, and United States. When DeBlanc broke up in 1975, some of the original members (including Beard and Carriere) formed a new group called Starfire.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> For one successful year, Starfire performed essentially in the United States, with a few key dates in Finland and Iran. After the tour, the group decided to disband. Around this time Beard developed a strong relationship with Sylvers. She was, at that time, performing with [[Capitol records|Capitol]] recording artists, [[The Sylvers]] as a fill-in on live dates for the female Sylvers who were minors.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> This new association proved beneficial to both Beard and Carriere, as Sylvers introduced each to Griffey.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> Spencer first met Sylvers when he appeared at the Sylvers\' [[Palos Verdes]] home, unannounced, to audition as bass player for the Sylvers. It was that introduction coupled with Spencer\'s performance dates with the Sylvers that cemented what both Sylvers and Griffey needed for their new group.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> Work then began on Dynasty\'s first album.

The band\'s debut album \'\'[[Your Piece of the Rock]]\'\', released in 1979, yielded the band\'s first R&B hit, "I Don\'t Want to Be a Freak (But I Can\'t Help Myself)". The track peaked at #20 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in late 1979.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

During the late 1970s to mid-1980s, recordings by SOLAR groups such as [[The Whispers]], [[Shalamar]], [[Midnight Star]], and Dynasty, would become hits, and although Dynasty was not as successful as The Whispers or Shalamar, they did enjoy a few chart entries.

\'\'[[Adventures in the Land of Music]]\'\', released in 1980, was Dynasty\'s second album. The set contained their biggest hit, "I\'ve Just Begun to Love You" (which peaked at #6 on the [[United States|US]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]]; #87 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]; and #51 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]),<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/><ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=178}}</ref> as well as the songs, "Do Me Right" and "Groove Control." The three songs combined to reach number five on the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Dance]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=85}}</ref> The title track would provide the key [[sampling (music)|samples]] for [[Camp Lo]]\'s "Luchini AKA This Is It", [[Angie Stone]]\'s "Lovers\' Ghetto", [[Terri Walker]]\'s "This Is My Time", [[Tha\' Rayne]]\'s "Kiss Me", [[Brooke Valentine]]\'s "Long As You Come Home", Rashad\'s "Sweet Misery", [[Antiloop]]\'s "Catch Me", [[Jadakiss]]\'s "How I Feel", HaLo\'s "Follow Me", [[Rushden & Diamonds (music group)]]\' "Lil\' Bits", DSP\'s "Tisztelet a Kiv\xc3\xa9telnek", and [[Wiz Khalifa]]\'s "Won\'t Land."

Sylvers joined the group in 1981, but his presence did not elevate their success. That year they released their third album, \'\'[[The Second Adventure]]\'\'.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> Although it did produce two top forty R&B hits, "Here I Am" and "Love in the Fast Lane", the album was largely overlooked. Sylvers and Beard were briefly married during the early 1980s.

Three more albums followed, 1982\'s \'\'[[Right Back at Cha!]]\'\', 1986\'s \'\'[[Daydreamin\' (Dynasty album)|Daydreamin\']]\'\', 1988\'s \'\'Out of Control\'\'.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> \'\'Right Back at Cha!\'\' had two US singles released; "Check It Out" and "Strokin\'". Only "Check It Out" saw chart action and the album reached in the middle of the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]].  In the UK the label went for two other singles; "The Only One" and "Does That Ring A Bell", where the latter entered the UK Singles Chart peaking at #53.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Their final studio release was 1988\'s \'\'Out of Control\'\', but hit singles had dried up.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/> Curiously, the \'\'Out of Control\'\' album had exactly the same cover as the preceding album (\'\'Daydreamin\' \'\') and also included several of the same tracks.  The singles "Don\'t Waste My Time" and "Tell Me (Do You Want My Love)?" were taken off the album. Even though new SOLAR producers, [[L.A. Reid]] and  [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], were brought in to produce the album, the group could not revive their earlier glory and disbanded soon afterwards.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco"/>  Although the group had disbanded, they would later appear as backing vocalists on [[gospel music|gospel]] artist and label-mate Juanita G. Hines\' 1994 album \'\'Jesus, My Wonderful Friend\'\'.

Beard, who had written much of Dynasty\'s material, continued as a songwriter. Her songs appeared on albums by Shalamar, The Whispers, [[7th Wonder]], [[911 (band)|911]], and LaRue. Carriere continued as a background vocalist. Keyboardist-singer Spencer returned to studio work and can be heard on recordings by [[Carrie Lucas]], Shalamar, The Whispers, Tin Harris, and [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]]. Sylvers went on to have a successful career as the producer and songwriter of such artists as [[Howard Hewett]], [[Ahmad Jamal]], [[The Brothers Johnson]], [[Glenn Jones]] and [[Blackstreet]].

The band has recently reissued most of their albums on [[Compact disc|CD]], through Canadian [[independent record label]], [[Unidisc Music Inc.]].

In 1969, [[Maurice White]], a former session drummer for [[Chess Records]] and former member of the [[Ramsey Lewis Trio]], joined two friends in Chicago, [[Wade Flemons]] and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team composing songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends got a recording contract with [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]; they called themselves the "Salty Peppers" and had a marginal hit in the Midwestern area called "La La La".<ref name=salty>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p199633|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Salty Peppers \xe2\x80\x93 Overview|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref>

The Salty Peppers\' second single, "Uh Huh Yeah", did not fare as well, and Maurice moved from Chicago to Los Angeles. He then added to the band singer Sherry Scott<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/sherryscottjazz|title=Sherry Scott|publisher=myspace.com|accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, and then asked his younger brother [[Verdine White|Verdine]] how he would feel about heading out to the West Coast. On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes of the band, featuring [[Donny Hathaway]], around to different record labels and the band was thus signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=salty /><ref name = "Nathan-1993">[[The Eternal Dance (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|\'\'The Eternal Dance\'\']], 1993, Liner notes & text by [[David Nathan (music critic)|David Nathan]].</ref>

===Formation and early years (1971\xe2\x80\x931973)===
[[File:Lastdaysandtimealbum.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of 1972 album [[Last Days and Time]]]]
Maurice\'s [[astrological sign]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], has a primary [[Classical element|elemental]] quality of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and seasonal qualities of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]], according to [[Astrology and the classical elements#Triplicities by season|classical triplicities]]. (Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of [[Water (classical element)|Water]], the fourth [[classical element]].) Based on this, he changed the band\'s name, to "Earth, Wind & Fire". Maurice ([[mbira]]) held further auditions in L.A. adding Michael Beale on guitar, Chester Washington on [[Reed (instrument)|reeds]], and Leslie Drayton on trumpet; Drayton also served as the group\'s musical arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas and electric pianist/vocalist Wade Flemons completed the then ten-man EWF lineup.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref name=chuck>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckthewriter.com/ewf.html|title=Earth Wind and Fire I\'ll Write a Song for You|publisher=Goldmine Magazine|first= Miller|last=Chuck|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

The band\'s self-titled debut album, \'\'[[Earth, Wind & Fire (album)|Earth, Wind, & Fire]],\'\' was released in February 1971 to critical acclaim, as was November 1971\'s \'\'[[The Need of Love]]\'\'. Both albums were produced by [[Joe Wissert]] and a single, from \'\'The Need of Love\'\' called "I Think About Lovin\' You", with Sherry Scott on lead vocals, provided EWF with their first Top 40 R&B hit. In 1971, the group also recorded the [[Sweet Sweetback\'s Baadasssss Song (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Melvin Van Peebles]] film \'\'[[Sweet Sweetback\'s Baadasssss Song]]\'\'.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The soundtrack was recorded at Paramount Recording Studios on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] and released on [[Stax Records]]. The band developed a growing popularity on college campuses but, in spite of this, some members of EWF started to become restless and the band broke up after having been together less than six months. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group.

In 1972, Maurice added vocalist [[Jessica Cleaves]], a former member of the [[R&B]] group [[The Friends of Distinction]], [[Ronnie Laws]] on the [[flute]] and saxophone, rhythm guitarist [[Roland Bautista]], keyboardist [[Larry Dunn]], percussionist [[Ralph Johnson (musician)|Ralph Johnson]], and vocalist and Denver native [[Philip Bailey]] to the group. Warner Brothers didn\'t know how to promote this new combo as the only other funk band on their label was [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo\'s management of [[John Sebastian]] led to a series of gigs as the opening act for the pop/folk singer and [[The Lovin\' Spoonful]] founder. A performance at New York\'s [[Rockefeller Center]] introduced EWF to [[Clive Davis]], then the President of [[Columbia Records]]. Davis was very impressed with the band\'s performance and bought their contract from Warner Bros. Their debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, \'\'[[Last Days and Time]]\'\', featured mostly original material, but Bailey had recommended that the band cover the [[Pete Seeger]] song "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", and the elements also remade the [[Bread (band)|Bread]] hit "[[Make It with You]]".<ref name = "Nathan-1993" /><ref name=chuck /> The album also includes the original (Maurice-penned) composition "Power", an uptempo eight-minute instrumental. In stark contrast to the ballads, "Power" features extended fuzz guitar and soprano saxophone solos set against a driving funk beat.

===Classic period (1973\xe2\x80\x931980)===
[[Image:Earth Wind and Fire Symbol.jpg|thumb|right| Portrayed on the cover of the album, \'\'[[The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1]]\'\' is Earth, Wind & Fire\'s official symbol.]]

The album \'\'[[Head to the Sky]]\'\' was released in the spring of 1973 and gave the group their first two legitimate hit singles, "[[Evil (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Evil]]", co-written by Maurice and Philip, and "[[Keep Your Head to the Sky]]", both of which reached the top 30 and the top 60 on the R&B and pop charts, respectively. After this album\'s release some personnel changes took place as Ronnie Laws, Roland Bautista, and Jessica Cleaves left the band to pursue new musical opportunities; the album was also their last to be produced by Joe Wissert. Philip Bailey had recommended his former Denver [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]] classmate, saxophonist [[Andrew Woolfolk]], to the band. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro [[Joe Henderson]] and was about to start a career in banking when Bailey called. To fill the void created by Bautista\'s departure, rhythm guitarists [[Al McKay]] (who had performed with the [[Ike and Tina Turner|Ike and Tina Turner Revue]] and The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band) and Johnny Graham from R&B group [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]] were added to round out the new lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almckay.com/bio.php|title=BIO Al McKay|publisher=almckay.com}}</ref> As some of the band\'s songs required lower register vocals than Bailey\'s, and due to the success of "Evil", Maurice altered his role in the group to incorporate that of lead vocalist.

Recorded at [[Colorado]]\'s [[Caribou Ranch|Caribou Ranch Studio]] and released in 1974, \'\'[[Open Our Eyes]]\'\' was a commercially successful LP, selling over a million copies in the US and thus was certified Platinum. At Maurice\'s request, \'\'Open Our Eyes\'\' was co-produced by [[Charles Stepney]] with White. Stepney had previously worked with [[The Dells]], [[The Rotary Connection]], [[Terry Callier]], [[Minnie Riperton]], and the [[Ramsey Lewis Trio]], to name a few.<ref name=allmusic>
{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p128469|pure_url=yes}}|title= Charles Stepney Biography|publisher= allmusic.com}}
</ref> Released in May 1974, the single "[[Mighty Mighty (song)|Mighty Mighty]]" became Earth, Wind & Fire\'s first top 30 hit on the pop charts, peaking at No. 29. Another single, "[[Devotion (song)|Devotion]]", was a song with a strong spiritual message. This album also saw the inclusion of Maurice\'s younger brother, [[Fred White (musician)|Fred White]], into the band. Fred had played in Chicago clubs as a drummer with [[Donny Hathaway]] and [[Little Feat]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

On April 6, 1974, Earth, Wind & Fire performed at the [[California Jam]], a West Coast rock festival that attracted an audience of 200,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://californiajam.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3&Itemid=42/|title=California Jam brought 200,000 rock enthusiasts to the region 28 years ago, making Ontario the rock capital of the nation| publisher=californiajam.com|first=David| last=Allen|date=April 4, 2002}}</ref> Also in 1974, the band collaborated with Ramsey Lewis on his album \'\'[[Sun Goddess (album)|Sun Goddess]]\'\', which reached number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Jazz and Black Album charts and was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.

In 1975, Earth, Wind & Fire was approached by [[Sig Shore]], producer of the motion picture \'\'[[Super Fly (film)|Super Fly]]\'\', to record the soundtrack to new film about the dark side of the recording industry called \'\'[[That\'s the Way of the World (film)|That\'s The Way Of The World]]\'\'. The film also starred EWF as a new recording act known as "The Group"; they performed songs in the film and Maurice had a small speaking part, as leader of "The Group". In the film [[Harvey Keitel]]\'s character hears "The Group" performing and produces their first album. The film\'s title is repeated throughout the film as a shrug of the shoulders to the music world.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

When the band saw the film, they were convinced that the motion picture would be a [[box office bomb|bomb]], which it eventually was.<ref name=chuck /> To avoid being connected with the movie they released the album\'s soundtrack, also entitled \'\'[[That\'s the Way of the World]]\'\', before its premiere. Recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio and co-produced by Maurice White and Charles Stepney [[That\'s the Way of the World]] became Earth, Wind & Fire\'s breakthrough album, spending three weeks at number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Pop Albums Charts, five nonconsecutive weeks atop the Soul Albums chart.<ref name=mixonline>{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_earth_wind_fires/| title=Classic Tracks: Earth, Wind & Fire\'s "Shining Star"|publisher=mixonline.com|first=Robyn |last=Flans|date=December 1, 2004|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref> \'\'That\'s the Way of the World\'\' was also warmly received critically. For instance, [[AllMusic]]\'s Alex Henderson described the album as "one of the strongest albums of the 70\'s" and "EWF\'s crowning achievement", and \'\'[[Billboard Magazine]]\'\' called it "a very tightly produced and performed package". The album made EWF the first black act to top both the \'\'Billboard\'\' album and singles charts and was certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Included on the album were the hit singles "[[Shining Star (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Shining Star]]" \xe2\x80\x93 which rose to number one on the R&B Singles and \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 and won the band a [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] \xe2\x80\x93 and "[[That\'s the Way of the World (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|That\'s the Way of the World]]", which went to number five and number 12 on the R&B Singles and \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100, respectively. Because of the album\'s tremendous commercial success, the band was able to hire a full [[horn section]], which was dubbed the [[Phenix Horns]]. The Phenix Horns, who became an integral part of the band\'s sound, were composed of saxophonist [[Don Myrick]], [[trombonist]] [[Louis Satterfield]], and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and [[Michael Harris (trumpeter)|Michael Harris]]. Myrick and Satterfield both worked with Maurice during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records.

Subsequent to EWF\'s first tour of Europe, where they opened for the rock band [[Santana (band)|Santana]], Columbia Records wanted another album released as soon as possible. As a result EWF returned to the studio in June 1975 and from these recording sessions two singles - "[[Sing a Song (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Sing a Song]]" and "[[Can\'t Hide Love]]", the latter written by Clarence "Skip" Scarborough - were spawned.<ref name="Nathan-1993" /> These and other studio recordings were included, along with mostly live concert material from their 1974 and 1975 tours, on the double album \'\'[[Gratitude (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|Gratitude]]\'\', released in late 1975. \'\'Gratitude\'\' rose to and stayed at number one on the pop and R&B charts for three weeks and six weeks respectively; it was also the second bestselling R&B album of 1976 and is certified triple Platinum for sales of over 3,000,000 copies in the US by the RIAA.<ref name=billboard>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Top+R%26B%2FHip-Hop+Albums&g=Year-end+Albums&year=1976 Billboard. com \xe2\x80\x93 Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums of 1976]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=783|title=1975 Down Beat Readers Poll|publisher=downbeat.com|date = December 31, 1975}}

The band was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] for the title track, "Gratitude". "[[Can\'t Hide Love]]" was also Grammy-nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices|Best Arrangement For Voices]]. Earth, Wind & Fire also won a [[Rock Music Awards|Rock Music Award]] in the category of Best Soul Album for \'\'Gratitude\'\' and \'\'[[Down Beat]]\'\' magazine\'s Readers Poll for favorite Rock/Blues Group in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=l5kuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tqEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=834,1365003&dq=earth+wind+%26+fire+gratitude&hl=en|title=Mccartney, Ronstadt top in annual rock awards|publisher=Montreal Gazette|year=1976|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref><ref name=EARTHWINDANDFIRE>[http://www.earthwindandfire.com/bio_awards.html earthwindandfire.com/bio_awards]</ref>

Additionally, in 1975 Maurice established a production company called Kalimba Productions to which he signed artists such as  his former bandleader Ramsey Lewis, singer [[Deniece Williams]] (a former member of [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s Wonderlove backup group) and [[girl group]] [[The Emotions]], who had a run of hits with Stax Records from 1969 to 1974. Maurice loaned the band\'s signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put on tour with Earth, Wind & Fire these artists and others who were signed to Kalimba Productions.

After helping co-produce and arrange Earth, Wind & Fire\'s new album, Deniece Williams\'s debut album, \'\'[[This Is Niecy]]\'\', Ramsey Lewis\'s \'\'[[Salongo]]\'\', and The Emotion\'s first [[Columbia Records]] album \'\'[[Flowers (The Emotions album)|Flowers]]\'\', Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976 in Chicago at the age of 43. He was survived by his wife Rubie, his three daughters, Eibur, Charlene and Chante, his parents and his brother.<ref>[http://www.charlesstepney.org/the_man.html ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>
With Stepney\'s passing Maurice took over and completed the production of the band\'s new album, \'\'[[Spirit (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|Spirit]]\'\', which was released October 1976. EWF paid tribute to Stepney in the form of the album\'s title and that of its title track.
The album reached number 2 on the Billboard Pop and R&B Albums Chart and was certified double Platinum in the US by the [[RIAA]]; additionally, \'\'Spirit\'\' spawned the hit singles "[[Getaway (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Getaway]]" and "[[Saturday Nite (song)|Saturday Nite]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6508|pure_url=yes}} Spirit \xe2\x80\x93 Charts on Allmuisc.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Earth%20Wind&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 RIAA Certification for Spirit]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wholecircleround.co.uk/discovision/spins/stepney7.htm|title=Charles Stepney \xe2\x80\x93 A Shining Star Eclipsed|publisher=wholecircleround.co.uk|accessdate=May 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t825284|pure_url=yes}}|title=Getaway \xe2\x80\x93 song review|publisher=allmusic.com|first=Ed|last=Hogan|accessdate=May 10, 2009}}</ref>

During this period EWF concerts started to become loaded with pyrotechnics, magic, laser lights, flying pyramids, levitating guitarists and elaborate production tricks, that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid and a disappearing act, which saw EWF literally vanishing from sight. Magician [[Doug Henning]] directed many of their tours throughout the 1970s with his young assistant, [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. The band also began to be choreographed by [[George Faison]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref name=icsolihull>{{cite web|url=http://icsolihull.icnetwork.co.uk/whatson/entertainment/2004/03/22/back-in-boogie-wonderland-50003-14077035|title= Back in Boogie Wonderland|publisher=The Birmingham Post|first=Charlie|last=Melvin|date=March 22, 2004}}</ref>

In November 1977, the group released another studio LP, \'\'[[All \'N All]]\'\'. With an Egyptian/post modernistic themed album cover, \'\'All \'N All\'\' featured the hit singles "[[Serpentine Fire]]" and "[[Fantasy (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Fantasy]]", and achieved triple Platinum status. This album was the first of several to feature striking [[album cover|cover]] art by the Japanese artist [[Shusei Nagaoka]].<ref>

</ref>

In 1978, EWF picked up three Grammy Awards, the third for their rendition of [[The Beatles]]\' "[[Got to Get You into My Life]]". EWF\'s performance of the song was included on the self-titled soundtrack of the movie, \'\'[[Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Heart\'s Club Band]]\'\'. The film was a commercial failure; however, "Got to Get You into My Life" was the biggest hit from the movie\'s soundtrack, reaching numbers one and nine on the R&B and Pop singles charts, respectively.

1978 was also the year that Maurice and EWF\'s managers Cavallo and Ruffalo worked out a deal for the launch of a new record label called The American Recording Company (ARC), to be distributed through CBS, and the creation of a recording studio, [[George Massenburg]]/ARC, also called "The Complex", in West Los Angeles. The year ended with the release of another hit single, entitled "[[September (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|September]]", which was added to the quintuple [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] compilation album, \'\'[[The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1]]\'\', which came out on November 23, 1978, four days before Thanksgiving. At this time, Bobby Harris of the [[Dazz Band]] requested and got Philip Bailey to produce the group\'s first album, \'\'Kinsman Dazz\'\'. Bailey had a major input into the group\'s vocal arrangements and would also co-produce the band\'s second album, \'\'Dazz\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p39851|pure_url=yes}}|title=(((Kinsman Dazz > Biography)))|publisher=allmusic.com|first= Andrew|last=Hamilton|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref>

January 1979 saw the band performing "September" and "That\'s The Way Of The World" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]], which was broadcast worldwide from the [[United Nations General Assembly]] by [[NBC]]. Other artists performing at the event were [[ABBA]], the [[Bee Gees]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Donna Summer]] and [[Rod Stewart]]. Subsequent to this performance the band donated the royalties from one of their songs to [[UNICEF]] and began a tour of Europe and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Music-For-Unicef-Concert-A-Gift-Of-Song/release/1308466| title=Various \xe2\x80\x93 Music For Unicef Concert: A Gift Of Song|publisher=discogs|accessdate=May 7, 2009}}</ref>

The group\'s ninth album overall, seventh for Columbia Records, and second released on the ARC label was \'\'[[I Am (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|I Am]]\'\'. It was another smash hit, going double Platinum and reaching numbers 3 and 1 on the R&B and Pop charts, respectively. Singles spawned from this album included "[[In The Stone]]", "Can\'t Let Go", and the sad [[David Foster]]/[[Bill Champlin]]-written ballad "[[After the Love Has Gone]]", which rose to the number 2 spot on the \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\' Pop and [[R&B]] charts and won a Grammy for the [[Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1980]]. Though the band had previously overlooked disco, the summer of 1979 saw EWF topping the dance music charts with their most disco-inspired single "[[Boogie Wonderland]]", which was produced by Maurice and Al McKay and featured [[The Emotions]]. Even with the song\'s success, Verdine White claims that the band is not a disco band, saying: "I guess you could say we were at the party but didn\xe2\x80\x99t get on the dance floor."<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6512|pure_url=yes}}| title= I Am \xe2\x80\x93 Review|author=Henderson, Alex|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}</ref><ref name=contactmusic.com>

In October 1980, the double-album \'\'[[Faces (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|Faces]]\'\' was released, and rose to number 2 and number 10 and the R&B and Pop charts respectively; it earned Gold status in the US. In a 2007 interview, when asked which EWF album was his favorite, Maurice White replied: "Probably \'\'Faces\'\' because we were really in tune, playing together and it gave us the opportunity to explore new areas."<ref name=bluesandsoul>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/195/maurice_white/|title= Maurice white: still burning bright|publisher=bluesandsoul.com|first=David|last=Nathan|year=2007}}</ref> After the release of this album, longtime rhythm guitarist Al McKay left the band for personal as well as professional reasons. He was replaced by returning rhythm guitarist [[Roland Bautista]], who gave the band a bit of a hard rock sound with his style of playing.

===Electronic period (1981\xe2\x80\x931990)===
White decided that, given the changing musical landscape, the band needed to incorporate into their work more of the digital sound which was popular at the time. As a result, EWF\'s eleventh album titled \'\'Raise!\'\' - was influenced with this new electronic sound and released in the fall of 1981 - sold over a million copies in the US and was certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]]. \'\'Raise!\'\' featured the hit single "[[Let\'s Groove]]", which also went Platinum, and another single "[[Wanna Be With You]]", which won EWF a Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group. Earth, Wind & Fire appeared at [[American Bandstand]]\'s 30th Anniversary Special, where they performed "Let\'s Groove" on October 30, 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/american-bandstand/american-bandstands-30th-anniversary-special/episode/216607/summary.html| title=American Bandstand\'s 30th Anniversary Special|publisher=tv.com}}</ref>
[[File:White and Baiiley Earth Wind and Fire.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Earth, Wind, and Fire\'s Maurice White and Philip Bailey performing in 1982 at the Ahoy Rotterdam, The Netherlands]]

Two years after the release of \'\'Raise!\'\' came \'\'[[Powerlight]]\'\', which included the singles "[[Fall In Love With Me]]", a number 17 pop hit, and "Side By Side". "Powerlight" went Gold. Also in 1983, the song "Dance, Dance, Dance" was contributed to the soundtrack of the animated film \'\'[[Rock & Rule]]\'\'. After the fully synthesized album \'\'[[Electric Universe (album)|Electric Universe]]\'\' was released in late 1983 to a poor critical and commercial reception, Maurice believed the band needed a break so he put EWF on hiatus.

During their hiatus, Philip Bailey released his second and most commercially successful solo project, the Gold album \'\'[[Chinese Wall (album)|Chinese Wall]]\'\', featuring the [[Phenix Horns]] and produced by [[Phil Collins]]. The first single from that album, a duet with Collins called "[[Easy Lover]]", sold over a million copies, rose to number 2 on the US \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 and number 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] respectively, and was [[Grammy]]-nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Vocal Performance By A Duo or Group]]. The music video of Bailey and Collins rehearsing their collaboration went to the top of MTV\'s video playlist and won an [[MTV Video Music Award]] for Best Overall Performance in 1985. Bailey released four [[gospel music|gospel]] albums in this period, and one of them, titled \'\'[[Triumph (Philip Bailey album)|Triumph]]\'\', won him a [[Grammy Award for Best Gospel Vocal Performance, Male]].

Maurice White, during this time, produced for [[Barbra Streisand]] on her Platinum album \'\'[[Emotion (Barbra Streisand album)|Emotion]]\'\' and worked with [[Neil Diamond]] on his Gold album \'\'[[Headed for the Future]]\'\' and [[Cher]] on her 1987 Platinum album \'\'[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]\'\'. He also released the self-titled solo album \'\'[[Maurice White (album)|Maurice White]]\'\' in 1985, which included a cover of "[[Stand by Me (song)|Stand by Me]]" that went to number six on the R&B charts and number eleven on the Adult Contemporary charts. The album also featured an appearance by saxophonist [[Gerald Albright]]. Also, during the hiatus, Verdine White worked behind the scenes, writing and directing videos. He produced \'\'[[Standing in the Light]]\'\', by the English pop rock and jazz-funk band [[Level 42]], with Larry Dunn, and promoted go-go bands like [[Trouble Funk]] and [[Experience Unlimited|E.U.]]<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The compilation album \'\'[[The Collection (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|The Collection]]\'\' was released May 1986, stayed at number 5 on the UK singles charts for two weeks, and was certified Gold in the UK by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].

[[Phil Collins]] saw EWF on one of their European tours and became a fan of the band. He came in contact with the [[Phenix Horns]] and they eventually worked with his band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] on songs including "[[No Reply At All]]" and "[[Paperlate]]", and with him on such solo hits as "[[I Missed Again]]" and "[[Sussudio]]".

In 1987, CBS Records convinced both Philip Bailey and Maurice White that a reunion of Earth, Wind & Fire would be fruitful. As a result, original members Verdine White, Ralph Johnson and Andrew Woofolk returned to the band with new members guitarist/vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], lead guitarist [[Dick Smith (musician)|Dick Smith]], and drummer [[Sonny Emory]]. A new horn section dubbed the Earth, Wind & Fire Horns was also created, made up of Gary Bias on the saxophone, [[Raymond Lee Brown]] on the trumpet, and Reggie Young on the flugelhorn and trombone.

The band\'s reformation fostered the 1987 Gold album \'\'[[Touch the World]]\'\', which was nominated for a [[Soul Train Award]] in the category of [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year|Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year]] and rose to number three on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 33 on The \'\'Billboard\'\' 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WHwlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z_UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1824,1006825&dq=earth+wind+%26+fire+soul+train+awards&hl=en|title=Soul Train Music Awards\' To Honor Gladys Knight And The Pips With A Trophy|publisher=Google }}</ref> Featured on the album was a song penned by an unknown songwriter by the name of Skylark, titled "[[System of Survival]]". Released as a single, the song became a hit, going to number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' R&B charts and Dance charts. Another single titled "[[Thinking of You (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|Thinking Of You]]" peaked at number one and number three on the R&B and Dance charts as well. In 1988, the band released the compilation album \'\'[[The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 2]]\'\', which went Gold in the US.

A website entitled www.Startalk.org was set up in 1999 to offer Maurice support with his health struggles and on it, messages of encouragement from celebrities such as [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Tom Morello]] of [[Rage Against the Machine]] were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startalk.org/celeb_messages/|title=Celebrity Messages to Maurice|publisher=startalk.org|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> Maurice, however, has the disease under control, so much so that he occasionally makes appearances at Earth, Wind & Fire performances, and continues to write, record, produce and develop new recordings for Earth, Wind & Fire and other artists.

Kendricks was born in [[Union Springs, Alabama]] on December 17, 1939, the son of Johnny and Lee Bell Kendrick. He had one sister, Patricia, and three brothers, Charles, Robert, and Clarence. His family moved to the [[Ensley (Birmingham)|Ensley]] neighborhood of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], where he met and began singing with his best friend [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] in their church choir in the late 1940s. In 1955, Kendricks, Williams, and friends Kell Osborne and Jerome Averette formed a doo-wop group called The Cavaliers, and began performing around Birmingham. The group decided to move for better opportunities in their musical careers, and in 1957 the group moved to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. In Cleveland, they met manager Milton Jenkins, and soon moved with Jenkins to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], where the Cavaliers renamed themselves "The Primes". Under Jenkins\' management, the Primes were successful in the Detroit area, eventually creating a female spin-off group called The Primettes (later [[The Supremes]]). In 1961, Osbourne moved to [[California]], and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks and Paul Williams joined forces with members Otis Williams and Melvin "Blue" Franklin of Otis Wiliiams and the Distants after three members quit and became The Elgins, who on the same day changed their name to "The Temptations" and signed to Motown.

===With the Temptations===
{{main|The Temptations}}
The Temptations began singing background for [[Mary Wells]]. After an initial dry period, The Temptations quickly became the most successful male vocal group of the [[1960 in music|1960s]]. Although technically Kendricks was [[tenor|first tenor]] in the group\'s harmony, he predominately sang in a falsetto voice. Among the Temptations songs Kendricks sang lead on were "[[(You\xe2\x80\x99re My) Dream Come True|Dream Come True]]" (1962), the group\'s first charting single; "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" (1964), the group\'s first US Top 20 hit; "[[I\'ll Be in Trouble]]" (1964); "[[The Girl\'s Alright With Me]]" (1964), a popular [[b-side]] that Kendricks co-wrote; "[[Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)]]" (1964); "[[Get Ready (1966 song)|Get Ready]]" (1966); "[[Please Return Your Love to Me]]" (1968); and "[[Just My Imagination]]" (1971). He was also allowed to sing a few leads in his natural voice such as "[[May I Have This Dance]]" (1962). He shares lead vocal duty on other records, including "[[You\'re My Everything]]" (1967) (shared with [[David Ruffin]]), and a long string of [[Norman Whitfield]] [[record producer|produced]] [[psychedelic soul]] records where all five Temptations sang lead, such as the Grammy winner "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]" (1968), "[[I Can\'t Get Next to You]]" (1969), and "[[Ball of Confusion]]" (1970). He also leads on "[[I\'m Gonna Make You Love Me]]" (1968), a popular duet with [[The Supremes|Diana Ross and the Supremes]], and on the Temptations\' famous version of the [[Christmas]] classic "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (1968).

[[File:Temptations-group-pic.jpg|250px|thumb|Eddie Kendricks (2nd from left) with the Temptations in 1967.]]
In the Temptations, Kendricks was responsible for creating most of the group\'s vocal arrangements, and also served as wardrobe manager, including the now famous purple suits the group wore for one performance. Though Whitfield had chief responsibility for writing, Kendricks co-wrote and received credit for several Temptations songs apart from "[[The Girl\'s Alright With Me]]" including "[[Isn\'t She Pretty]]" (1961) and "Don\'t Send Me Away" (1967). His favorite food was [[cornbread]], and as a result he was nicknamed "Cornbread" (or \'\'\'"Corn"\'\'\' for short) by his groupmates. According to [[Otis Williams]], Kendricks romantically pursued [[Diana Ross]], lead singer of the Supremes, and he was said to have been close friends with [[Martha Reeves]] of the Vandellas. In her second book, \'\'Supreme Faith\'\', Supremes singer [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] writes that she and Kendricks were lovers "briefly," but remained close friends.

Kendricks remained in the group through the rest of the decade, but a number of issues began to push him away from it in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was uncomfortable with singing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] style that Whitfield was now crafting for the group as opposed to the romantic ballads they had sung under the direction of Smokey Robinson; his friend Paul Williams was often too ill to perform with the group; and Kendricks often found himself at odds with bandmates [[Otis Williams]] and [[Melvin Franklin]]. As he grew away from the group, Kendricks began to rekindle his friendship with ex-Temptation [[David Ruffin]], who convinced him to leave the group.

In a 1991 interview with a [[Chicago]] television series called \'\'Urban Street\'\', Kendricks said he had actually considered leaving the group as early as 1965, even though that was when the band was finally starting to take off, because of things that "weren\'t quite proper." He explained that they were working with people that "didn\'t have their best interests at heart." Kendricks, however, initially decided to stay in the group because he was worried he would not get the support he needed if he left the group. Kendricks also expressed the fact that his relationship with [[Berry Gordy]] was less than cordial. "Berry Gordy is a man I don\'t know, I only met him about three times," he said, but "I know he didn\'t particularly care for me." Kendricks stated that he did not agree with many decisions that were made.

Following one final altercation with Williams and Franklin during a run at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] nightclub in November 1970, Kendricks walked off after the first night and didn\'t return, and it was mutually decided he would leave the group.<ref name="Otis book">[[Otis Williams|Williams, Otis]] and Romanowski, Patricia (1988, updated 2002). \'\'Temptations\'\'. Lanham, MD: Cooper Square. ISBN 0-8154-1218-5.</ref> While working on his first solo album, Kendricks recorded one last hit single with the Temptations, 1971\'s "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]". By the time the record reached #1 on the US pop charts in April 1971, Kendricks had signed a solo deal with Motown\'s Tamla imprint and was preparing the release of his first solo album, \'\'All By Myself\'\'. However, many of his problems with Motown would reoccur.

===Solo career and later years===
Kendricks\' solo career began slowly; he endured two years of singles that missed the Top 40, while The Temptations continued with their string of Norman Whitfield-helmed hits (one of which, "[[Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)]]", was written as a jab towards Kendricks and Ruffin). Despite enjoying only a modicum of commercial success and radio airplay, Kendricks\'s 1972 album \'\'People... Hold On\'\' (with the aid of his touring group, The Young Senators: [[Jimi Dougans]]. , Frank Hooker, LeRoy Fleming, Wornell Jones, David Lecraft, James Drumer Johnson, and John Engram) was a cornerstone of DJ playlists in downtown New York\'s nascent [[disco]] scene. The expansive, eight minute take on "Girl, You Need A Change Of Mind", which peaked at number thirteen on the soul chart,<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=319}}</ref> was a particular favorite at [[David Mancuso]]\'s Loft. The single was later remade by R&B singer [[D\'Angelo]] for the [[Get on the Bus]] [[Soundtrack]]. As the dance craze seeped through into other cities, Kendricks scored a #1 pop hit in 1973 with the [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]]-produced "[[Keep on Truckin\' (song)|Keep on Truckin\']]". It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Another notable song is "Intimate Friends" (1977), which is [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the [[Alicia Keys]] song "[[Unbreakable (Alicia Keys song)|Unbreakable]]", "A Penny for My Thoughts" by [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Sparkle (singer)|Sparkle]]\'s "Time to Move on" on her [[Sparkle (Sparkle album)|self-titled first studio album]], and for Sweet Sable\'s "Old Time\'s Sake" from the [[soundtrack]] for the 1994 [[2pac]] film, \'\'[[Above the Rim]]\'\'. [[Erykah Badu]] also sampled "Intimate Friends" for her song "Fall in Love (Your Funeral)", as well as his song "My People... Hold on" for her song "My People" on her album \'\'[[New Amerykah Part One (4th World War)]]\'\'.

Exasperated by a lack of creative and financial control, Kendricks left Motown in 1978, with the requirement of signing away the rights to his royalties. He moved first to [[Arista Records]], and later to [[Atlantic Records]].  By this time, his popularity had waned, and he was also gradually losing his voice as a result of [[chain smoking]].

He and [[David Ruffin]] briefly re-joined the Temptations for a 1982 reunion tour. 
In an interview with Tom Meros, [[Dennis Edwards]], Kendricks\'s former Temptations band mate, claimed that Kendricks had issues hitting his falsetto notes during recording sessions for the reunion album. Because of his singing difficulty, Edwards said that Kendricks went to a physician to examine his vocal ability. The physician discovered a "pin drop" of cancer on one of his lungs. However, Kendricks reportedly refused to undergo chemotherapy at the time because of fear that he would lose his hair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref>

Ruffin and Kendrick (Kendricks dropped the "s" from his stage name during the 1980s) reportedly met up one night when Ruffin went to watch Kendrick perform in a nightclub; Kendrick spotted Ruffin in the crowd, pointed him out, and invited him to come up on stage and perform with him. Afterward they talked about touring on their own and recorded an album as a duo for [[RCA Records|RCA]] in 1988.

[[File:Ruffin, Kendrick, Hall, Oates.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Eddie Kendrick and David Ruffin with [[Hall & Oates]] circa 1985.]]
Earlier, in 1985, they participated in the [[Hall & Oates]] live album \'\'Live at The Apollo\'\' recorded at a benefit at New York City\'s [[Apollo Theater]]; and sang with the duo at [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York. Hall & Oates have cited Kendrick and Ruffin specifically, and the Temptations in general, as a major influence.

In 1989, Kendrick, Ruffin, and their Temptations bandmates were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. There, Kendrick and Ruffin made plans with fellow former Temptation [[Dennis Edwards]] to tour and record as "Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards, Former Leads of The Temptations." The Ruffin/Kendrick/ Edwards project was cut short in 1991, when Kendrick was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and David Ruffin died of a [[drug overdose]], although Kendrick and Edwards continued to tour for the remainder of 1991.

==Death==
In late 1991, Kendrick, by now living in his native Birmingham, Alabama, underwent surgery to have one of his lungs removed in hopes of preventing the spread of the cancer. He continued to tour through the summer of 1992, when he fell ill again and was hospitalized. Kendricks died of lung cancer in Birmingham on October 5, 1992 at age 52. He was survived by his three children: Parris, Aika, and Paul Kendricks. He was buried in [[Elmwood Cemetery (Birmingham, Alabama)|Elmwood Cemetery]].

===Legacy===
In 1998, [[NBC]] aired \'\'[[The Temptations (TV miniseries)|The Temptations]]\'\', a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams. Kendricks was portrayed by actor [[Terron Brooks]].

On October 16, 1999, [http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Eddie_Kendrick_Memorial_Park Eddie Kendrick Memorial Park], located on the corner of 18th Street and 4th Avenue North, was dedicated to Birmingham native Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations. The park uses Kendricks\' family name sans the "s", which was added early in his career. The memorial features a bronze sculpture of Kendricks by local artist Ron McDowell, as well as sculptures of the other Temptations, set into a granite wall. Inscribed on the granite are the names of Temptation\'s hit songs. Recorded music can be heard throughout the park, featuring songs by Kendricks and the Temptations.

The \'\'\'Fatback Band\'\'\' (later, simply \'\'\'Fatback\'\'\') is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] and [[disco]] band. Most popular in the 1970s and 1980s, The Fatback Band is most known for their [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hits, "(Do The) Spanish Hustle", "I Like Girls", "Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money)", "Backstrokin\'" and "I Found Lovin". Their 1979 single "[[King Tim III (Personality Jock)]]" is sometimes considered the first [[hip hop]] single.

==History==
Formed in [[New York City]] in 1970, The Fatback Band was the concept of Bill Curtis, an experienced [[session musician|session]] [[drummer]], inspired to merge the "fatback" [[jazz]] beat of [[New Orleans]] into a [[funk]] band.  In addition to Curtis, the band\'s initial line-up included guitarist Johnny King, bassist Johnny Flippin, trumpet player George Williams, saxophonist Earl Shelton, flautist George Adams, and keyboardist Gerry Thomas. The band specialized in playing "street funk". The group also later included conga player Wayne Woolford, vocalists Jayne and Gerry, [[Deborah Cooper]] saxophonist Fred Demerey,  guitarist Louis Wright and George Victory.

The Fatback Band signed to [[Perception Records]] and had a hit single that summer with "Street Dance". The single reached the Top 30 on the [[United States|US]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], but failed to cross over to the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]], a pattern the group would follow for the rest of their career. The band released the albums \'\'Let\'s Do It Again\'\', \'\'People Music\'\', and \'\'Feel My Soul\'\' before signing to Event Records in 1974.

In the mid-1970s, the band incorporated jazz elements and moved more towards a [[disco]] sound resulting in the singles, "Keep On Steppin\'", "Yum, Yum (Give Me Some)", and "(Are You Ready) Do The Bus Stop". The singles proved popular in dance clubs, but did not do as well on R&B chart until the spring of 1976 when "(Do The) Spanish Hustle" came close to the Top Ten. "(Are You Ready) Do The Bus Stop" birthed the development of [[Line dance|line dancing]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Now recording for Spring/Polydor, the group continued with the singles, "Party Time", "The Booty", and "Double Dutch". Late 1977 brought a name change to Fatback, and in 1978 they found their first Top Ten single with "I Like Girls". The song "[[King Tim III (Personality Jock)]]" is often considered to be the first commercially released [[hip hop music|rap]] single, having shipped just a week before [[The Sugarhill Gang|The Sugarhill Gang\'s]] "[[Rapper\'s Delight]]" in October 1979.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LldOLnIQ66cC&pg=PR22&dq=king+tim+iii+first+rap+single&hl=en&ei=xPD7TNSCMIScOorf2dUK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=king%20tim%20iii%20first%20rap%20single&f=false Icons of hip hop: an encyclopedia of the movement, music, and culture, Volume 1, Mickey Hess, p.xxii, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, ISBN 0-313-33903-1, ISBN 978-0-313-33903-5]</ref>

In 1980, Fatback had a pair of their biggest hits with "Gotta Get My Hands On Some (Money)"  and "Backstrokin\'". Also finding the charts in the 1980s were "Take It Any Way You Can\'t It", "I Found Lovin\'", and "Spread Love", with singer [[Evelyn Thomas]], in 1985.  Whilst American pop success proved elusive, the group made regular appearances in the [[UK Singles Chart]], including the Top Ten twice with "(Do The) Spanish Hustle" and "I Found Lovin\'".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Keyboardist Gerry Thomas was simultaneously a member of [[The Jimmy Castor Bunch]], so the band elected to remain close to the New York area instead of extensive touring. They had substantial success in [[South America]], especially in [[Brazil]] (with "Money",  and "Backstrokin\'").

\'\'\'Funkadelic\'\'\' is an American band that was at its most prominent during the 1970s.  The band and its sister act [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], both led by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], began the [[funk|funk music]] culture of that decade.<ref>John, Bush. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4323/biography|pure_url=yes}} Funkadelic: Biography]. \'\'[[AllMusic]]\'\'.</ref>

==History==
The group that would become Funkadelic was originally formed by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] in 1964, as the unnamed musical backing for his [[doo wop]] group [[The Parliaments]] while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist [[Billy Bass Nelson]] and guitarist [[Eddie Hazel]] in 1967, then also added guitarist [[Tawl Ross]] and drummer [[Tiki Fulwood]]. The band name "Funkadelic" was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned the name "The Parliaments," the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.

As Funkadelic, the group signed to [[Westbound Records|Westbound]] in 1968. Around this time, the group\'s music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Sly Stone]] were major inspirations.<ref>Vincent, Rickey. [http://www.britannica.com/psychedelic/textonly/pfunk.html Parliament-Funkadelic]. \'\'[[Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica]]\'\'.</ref> This style later evolved into a tighter guitar-based funk (circa 1971-75), which subsequently, during the height of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] success (circa 1976-81), added elements of R&B and electronic music, with fewer psychedelic rock elements. The band made their first live television performance on \'\'[[Basic Black|Say Brother]]\'\' in October 7, 1969. They played a jam with songs "Into My Own Thing", "What Is Soul?"\t, "[[(I Wanna) Testify]]", "[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]" ([[Stevie Wonder]] cover), "Friday Night, August 14th" and "Music for My Mother".

The group\'s self-titled debut album, \'\'[[Funkadelic (album)|Funkadelic]]\'\', was released in 1970. The credits listed organist [[Mickey Atkins]] plus Clinton, Fulwood, Hazel, Nelson, and Ross. The recording also included the rest of the Parliaments singers (still uncredited due to contractual concerns), several uncredited session musicians then employed by [[Motown]], as well as Ray Monette (of [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]]) and future P-Funk mainstay [[Bernie Worrell]].

Bernie Worrell was officially credited starting with Funkadelic\'s second album, 1970s \'\'[[Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow]]\'\', thus beginning a long working relationship between Worrell and Clinton. The album \'\'[[Maggot Brain]]\'\' followed in 1971. The first three Funkadelic albums displayed strong psychedelic influences (not least in terms of production) and limited commercial potential, despite containing many songs that stayed in the band\'s setlist for several years and would influence many future funk, rock, and hip hop artists.

After the release of \'\'[[Maggot Brain]]\'\', the Funkadelic lineup was expanded greatly. [[Tawl Ross]] was unavailable after experiencing either a bad [[LSD]] trip or a speed overdose, while [[Billy Bass Nelson]] and [[Eddie Hazel]] quit due to financial concerns. From this point, many more musicians and singers would be added during Funkadelic\'s (and Parliament\'s) history, including the recruitment of several members of the famous James Brown backing band The JB\'s in 1972 - most notably [[Bootsy Collins]] and the [[Horny Horns]]. Bootsy and his brother [[Catfish Collins]] were recruited by Clinton to replace the departed Nelson and Hazel. Bootsy in particular become a major contributor to the [[P-Funk]] sound. In 1972, this new line-up released the politically charged double album \'\'[[America Eats Its Young]]\'\'. The lineup stabilized a bit with the album \'\'[[Cosmic Slop]]\'\' in 1973, featuring major contributions from recently added singer-guitarist [[Garry Shider]]. After first leaving the band, Eddie Hazel spent a year in jail after assaulting an airline stewardess and air marshal while under the influence of PCP,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zBwFHNeUF3UC&pg=PA236&dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=4#v=onepage&q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&f=false Funk: the music, the people, and the rhythm of the one] By Rickey Vincent p. 237.</ref><ref>Green, Tony.

Hazel only contributed to P-Funk sporadically thereafter.<ref>Sullivan, James.

George Clinton revived [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] in 1974 and signed that act to [[Casablanca Records]]. Parliament and Funkadelic featured mostly the same stable of personnel but operated concurrently under two names. At first, Parliament was designated as a more mainstream funk ensemble dominated by soulful vocals and horn arrangements, while Funkadelic was designated as a more experimental and freestyle guitar-based funk band. The ensemble usually toured under the combined name [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] or simply [[List of P-Funk members|P-Funk]] (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton\'s rapidly growing stable of funk artists).

In 1975 [[Michael Hampton]], a teen guitar prodigy, replaced Hazel as the premier lead guitarist in Parliament-Funkadelic, and was a major contributor to the next several Funkadelic albums. Funkadelic left Westbound in 1976 and moved to [[Warner Brothers]]. Their first album for Warner was \'\'[[Hardcore Jollies]]\'\' in 1976. Just before leaving Westbound, Clinton provided that label with a collection of recently recorded outtakes, which Westbound released as the album \'\'[[Tales of Kidd Funkadelic]]\'\'. That album did significantly better commercially than \'\'[[Hardcore Jollies]]\'\' and included "Undisco Kidd", an R&B Top 30 single. In 1977, Westbound capitalized further by releasing the anthology \'\'The Best of the Early Years\'\'.

As Parliament began achieving significant mainstream success in the 1975-1978 period, Funkadelic recorded and released its most successful and influential album, \'\'[[One Nation Under a Groove]]\'\' in 1978, adding former [[Ohio Players]] keyboardist [[Walter "Junie" Morrison]] and reflecting a more melodic dance-based sound. The title track spent six weeks at #1 on the R&B charts, around the time that Parliament was enjoying the #1 R&B singles "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]" and "[[Aqua Boogie]]". \'\'[[Uncle Jam Wants You]]\'\' in 1979 continued Funkadelic\'s new more electronic sound production. The album contains the fifteen-minute "[[(Not Just) Knee Deep]]" featuring former [[The Spinners (American band)|Spinners]] lead singer [[Philipp\xc3\xa9 Wynne]], an edited version of which topped the R&B charts. The final official Funkadelic album, \'\'[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]\'\', was released in 1981. The release was originally a double-album project, but it was reduced to a single disc under pressure from Warner Brothers. Some of the deleted tracks would appear on future P-Funk releases, most notably the 1982 hit single "[[Atomic Dog]]" which appeared on the first George Clinton solo album.

Meanwhile, the album \'\'[[Connections & Disconnections]]\'\' (re-issued on CD as \'\'Who\'s a Funkadelic\'\') was released under the name Funkadelic in 1981. The album was recorded by former Funkadelic members and original Parliaments [[Fuzzy Haskins]], [[Calvin Simon]], and [[Grady Thomas]], who had left P-Funk in 1977 after disagreements with George Clinton\'s management practices. This LP, notable for its heavy use of [[Thomas "Pae-dog" McEvoy]]\'s [[jazz]] [[French horn|horn]], contains the track called "You\'ll Like It Too", which came a very popular [[breakbeat]] source for the [[Hip hop]] community in the 80s. Another rebellious former band member, drummer [[Jerome Brailey]], released the album \'\'Mutiny on the Mamaship\'\', by his new band Mutiny. Even Clinton himself found this to be a good album despite containing lyrics that mocked him and his management of the P-Funk enterprise.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at Parliament\'s record label, [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars. In the mid-1980s, the last Funkadelic album \'\'[[By Way Of The Drum]]\'\' was recorded by Clinton with P-Funk personnel and many electronic devices. The album was rejected by its record label and did not see official release in America until it appeared as a reissue in 2007. It features a cover of "Sunshine Of Your Love" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. The album did not receive any publicity, but still received favorable reviews.

Clinton continued his P-Funk collective in the 1990s and 2000s, with a revolving stable of musicians, some of whom remain from the classic lineups of Funkadelic and Parliament. The rock-oriented sound of Funkadelic has diminished, as Clinton has moved towards more of an R&B and hip hop sound. In 1997 the group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/parliament-funkadelic |title=Parliament Funkadelic at Rock Hall |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>

Filmmaker Yvonne Smith of [[New York City]]-based Brazen Hussy productions produced \'\'Parliament-Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove,\'\' a full-length documentary about the groundbreaking group, which aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/parliamentfunkadelic/film.html Parliament Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove. The Film]. \'\'[[Public Broadcasting Service]]\'\'.</ref> As of 2008, Clinton was at work on a new Funkadelic album for his new record label. In November 2008, Westbound Records released \'\'[[Toys (album)|Toys]]\'\', a collection of Funkadelic outtakes and demos from the \'\'Free Your Mind\'\' and \'\'America Eats Its Young\'\' era. Critical reception of the album has generally been positive.  In April 2013, the band released their first single in over 25 years when they released "The Naz".  The song is a collaboration with Sly Stone and tells the story of Jesus Christ. The B-side to the song is "Nuclear Dog" which is guitar solo by former P-Funk guitarist Dewayne "Blackbird" McKnight.

\'\'\'Beverly Grace Jones\'\'\' (born 19 May 1948) is a [[Jamaica]]n singer, songwriter, model, record producer, and actress. She was born in [[Spanish Town]], Jamaica and raised by her grandparents. At 13 she moved with her siblings to their parents\' home in [[Syracuse, New York]].

In 1977 Jones secured a record deal with [[Island Records]]; with the aid of [[Compass Point All Stars]] she moved into [[New wave music|new wave]] in 1980. She scored Top 40 entries on the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "[[Pull Up to the Bumper]]", "[[I\'ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)|I\'ve Seen That Face Before]]", "[[Private Life]]", "[[Slave to the Rhythm (Grace Jones song)|Slave to the Rhythm]]" and "[[I\'m Not Perfect (But I\'m Perfect for You)|I\'m Not Perfect]]".

She appeared in some low-budget films in the U.S. during the 1970s and early 1980s. Her first mainstream film was the 1984 fantasy-action film \'\'[[Conan the Destroyer]]\'\' alongside [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and the 1985 [[James Bond]] movie \'\'[[A View to a Kill]]\'\'.

As a child,  shy Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her "skinny frame", but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica.<ref name="Sawyer">{{cite news|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|title=State of Grace: Miranda Sawyer Meets Grace Jones|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/12/grace-jones-hurricane|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=24 May 2013|location=London|date=11 October 2008}}</ref>

===1974\xe2\x80\x9379: Transition to music, and early releases===
Jones was signed by [[Island Records]], who put her in the studio with disco record producer, [[Tom Moulton]]. Moulton worked at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in [[Philadelphia]], and \'\'[[Portfolio (Grace Jones album)|Portfolio]]\'\', was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, "[[Send in the Clowns]]" by [[Stephen Sondheim]] from \'\'[[A Little Night Music]]\'\', "What I Did for Love" from \'\'[[A Chorus Line]]\'\' and "[[Tomorrow (1977 song)|Tomorrow]]" from \'\'[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]\'\'. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of [[\xc3\x89dith Piaf]]\'s "[[La Vie en rose]]" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, "Sorry", and "That\'s the Trouble", The album finished with "[[I Need a Man (Grace Jones song)|I Need a Man]]", Jones\' first club hit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Grace-Jones-Portfolio/release/1717094 |title=Grace Jones \xe2\x80\x93 Portfolio (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |work=discogs.com |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for \'\'[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]\'\'.

In 1978, Jones and Moulton made \'\'[[Fame (album)|Fame]]\'\', an immediate follow-up to \'\'Portfolio\'\', also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, "[[Autumn Leaves (song)|Autumn Leaves]]" by [[Jacques Pr\xc3\xa9vert]]. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, "Comme un oiseau qui s\'envole", which replaced "All on a Summers Night"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single "[[Do or Die (Grace Jones song)|Do or Die]]".

In the North American club scene, \'\'Fame\'\' was a hit album and the "Do or Die"/"Pride"/"Fame" side reached top 10 on both the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went [[out of print]]. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop.goldlegion.com/Grace-Jones-Fame-GLDN56226.htm |title=Grace Jones Fame |accessdate=21 August 2012 |publisher=shop.goldlegion.com}}</ref>

\'\'[[Muse (Grace Jones album)|Muse]]\'\' was the last of Jones\' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version "I\'ll Find My Way to You", which Jones released three years prior to \'\'Muse\'\'. Originally appearing on the 1976 Italian film, \'\'[[Colt 38 Special Squad]]\'\') in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called "Again and Again" which was featured on the film. Both songs were produced by composer [[Stelvio Cipriani]]. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson who arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track "Suffer" had previously worked in Munich, with disco stars such as [[Silver Convention]], [[Boney M.]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Amanda Lear]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]]. Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein.

===1980\xe2\x80\x9385: International breakthrough, \'\'Nightclubbing\'\', and movie career ===
With anti-disco sentiment spreading, and with the aid of the [[Compass Point All Stars]], Jones transitioned into [[new wave music]] with the 1980 release of \'\'[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]\'\'. The album included covers of songs by [[The Normal]] ("[[Warm Leatherette (song)|Warm Leatherette]]"), [[The Pretenders]] ("[[Private Life]]"), [[Roxy Music]] ("[[Love is the Drug]]"), [[Smokey Robinson]] ("[[The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game]]"), [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]] ("Breakdown") and [[Jacques Higelin]] ("Pars").

Originally, "Pull Up to the Bumper" was to be included on the album, but its R&B sound did not fit with the rest of the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=13898 |title=Pull Up to the Bumper by Grace Jones Songfacts |work=songfacts.com |accessdate=2 February 2012}}</ref>

The 1981 release of \'\'[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]\'\' included Jones\' covers of songs by [[Flash and the Pan]] ("[[Walking in the Rain (Flash and the Pan song)|Walking in the Rain]]"), [[Bill Withers]] ("[[Use Me (Bill Withers song)|Use Me]]"), [[Iggy Pop]]/[[David Bowie]] ("[[Nightclubbing (song)|Nightclubbing]]") and [[\xc3\x81stor Piazzolla]] ("[[I\'ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)|I\'ve Seen That Face Before]]"). Three songs were co-written by Jones: "Feel Up", "Art Groupie" and "[[Pull Up to the Bumper]]". [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] wrote "[[Demolition Man (song)|Demolition Man]]"; he later recorded it with [[The Police]] on the album \'\'[[Ghost in the Machine (The Police album)|Ghost in the Machine]]\'\'. "I\'ve Done It Again" was written by [[Marianne Faithfull]]. The strong rhythm featured on \'\'Nightclubbing\'\' was produced by Compass Point All Stars, including [[Sly and Robbie]], [[Wally Badarou]], [[Mikey Chung]], [[Uziah Thompson|Uziah "Sticky" Thompson]] and [[Barry Reynolds]]. The album entered in the Top 5 in four countries, and became Jones\' highest-ranking record on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] mainstream albums and R&B charts.

Having already recorded two reggae-oriented albums under the production of Compass Point All Stars, Jones went to [[Nassau, Bahamas]] in 1982 and recorded \'\'[[Living My Life (album)]]\'\'; the album resulted in Jones\' final contribution to the Compass Point trilogy, with only one cover, [[Melvin Van Peebles]]\'s "[[The Apple Stretching]]". The rest were original songs; "[[Nipple to the Bottle]]" was co-written with [[Sly Dunbar]], and, apart from "[[My Jamaican Guy]]", the other tracks were collaborations with [[Barry Reynolds]]. Despite receiving a limited single release, the [[Living My Life (song)|title track]] was left off the album. Further session outtakes included "Man Around the House" (Jones, Reynolds) and a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]\'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", both of which were included in the 1998 compilation \'\'[[Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions]]\'\'. The album\'s cover art resulted from another Jones/[[Jean-Paul Goude|Goude]] collaboration; the artwork has been described as being as famous as the music on the record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dummymag.com/reviews/2007/06/06/the-best-record-about-new-york-/ |title=The Apple Stretching Dummy \xc2\xbb Reviews |author=Paul Flynn |accessdate=24 May 2012 |publisher=dummymag.com}}</ref> It features Jones\' disembodied head cut out from a photograph and pasted onto a white background.

Jones\' three albums under the production of the Compass Point All Stars resulted in Jones\' \'\'[[A One Man Show|One Man Show]]\'\', a [[performance art]]/pop theatre presentation devised by Goude and Jones in which she also performed tracks from the albums \'\'[[Portfolio (Grace Jones album)|Portfolio]]\'\' ("[[La Vie en rose#Grace Jones version|La Vie en rose]]"), \'\'[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]\'\', ("[[Private Life]]", "[[Warm Leatherette]]"), \'\'[[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)|Nightclubbing]]\'\' ("Walking in the Rain", "Feel Up", "Demolition Man", "Pull Up to the Bumper" and "I\'ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango))" and from \'\'Living My Life\'\', "My Jamaican Guy" and the album\'s [[Living My Life|title track]]. Jones dressed in elaborate costumes and masks (in the opening sequence as a gorilla) and alongside a series of Grace Jones [[lookalike]]s.

After Jones\' success as a mainstream actress, she returned to the studio to work on \'\'[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]\'\', the last of her recordings for [[Island records|Island]]. [[Bruce Woolley]], Simon Darlow, [[Stephen Lipson]] and [[Trevor Horn]] wrote the material, and it was produced by Horn and Lipson. It was a concept album that featured several interpretations of the title track. The project was originally intended for [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] as a follow-up to "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]", but was given to Jones.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.perfectsongs.com/artists_writers/trevor_horn.html| title = Perfect Songs artists/writers Trevor Horn| accessdate = 12 February 2012| work = perfectsongs.com}}</ref> All eight tracks on the album featured excerpts from a conversation with Jones, speaking about many aspects of her life. The interview was conducted by journalist [[Paul Morley]]. The album features [[voice-over]]s from actor [[Ian McShane]] reciting passages from [[Jean-Paul Goude]]\'s biography \'\'Jungle Fever\'\'. \'\'Slave to the Rhythm\'\' was successful in [[German language in Europe|German-speaking countries]] and in the Netherlands, where it secured Top 10 placings. It reached #12 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] in November 1985 and became the second-highest-ranking album released by Jones.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9SQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=billboard+grace+jones+inside+story&hl=pt-BR&ei=xhGRTeH3A8TqgQea5qgZ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Billboard \xe2\x80\x93 Google Livros |publisher=[[Google Books]] |date=22 November 1986 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.br/books?id=ICUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=grace+jones+million&hl=pt-br&ei=OmqRTbeCGsLegQfghoUZ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=grace%20jones%20million&f=false |title=Billboard \xe2\x80\x93 Google Livros |publisher=Google Books |date=13 December 1986 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> Jones earned an [[MTV Video Music Award]] nomination for the title track\'s music video.

After her success with \'\'Slave to the Rhythm\'\', Island released \'\'[[Island Life]]\'\', Jones\' first best-of compilation, which featured songs from most of her releases with Island (\'\'Portfolio\'\', \'\'Fame\'\', \'\'Warm Leatherette\'\', \'\'Nightclubbing\'\', \'\'Living My Life\'\' and \'\'Slave to the Rhythm\'\'). American writer and journalist [[Glenn O\'Brien]] wrote the essay for the inlay booklet.

===1986\xe2\x80\x9389: \'\'Slave to the Rhythm\'\', \'\'Island Life\'\', and continued acting roles ===
After \'\'[[Slave to the Rhythm (album)|Slave to the Rhythm]]\'\' and \'\'[[Island Life]]\'\', Jones started to record again under a new contract with [[Manhattan Records]], which resulted in \'\'[[Inside Story (Grace Jones album)|Inside Story]]\'\', Jones teamed up with music producer [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]], who Jones had previously tried to work with during the disco era.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disco-disco.com/tributes/chic.shtml |title=Nile & Bernard - Chic - Tribute @ Disco-Disco.com |accessdate=19 April 2012 |publisher=disco-disco.com}}</ref> The album was recorded at Skyline Studios in New York and post-produced at Atlantic Studios and Sterling Sound. \'\'Inside Story\'\' was the first album Jones produced, which resulted in heated disputes with Rodgers. Musically, the album was more accessible than her previous albums with the Compass Point All Stars, and explored different styles of pop music, with undertones of jazz, gospel, and Caribbean sounds. All songs on the album were written by Jones and [[Bruce Woolley]]. Richard Bernstein teamed up with Jones again to provide the album\'s artwork. \'\'Inside Story\'\' made the top 40 in several European countries. The album was Jones\' last entry to date on US [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] albums chart. The same year, Jones starred as Katrina, an Egyptian queen vampire in the [[vampire film]] \'\'[[Vamp (film)|Vamp]]\'\'.

\'\'[[Bulletproof Heart]]\'\' was released in 1989, produced by Chris Stanley, who co-wrote, and co-produced the majority of the songs, and was featured as a guest vocalist on "Don\'t Cry Freedom". [[Robert Clivill\xc3\xa9s]] and [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] of [[C+C Music Factory]] produced some tracks on the album.

Despite several comeback attempts throughout the 1990s, Jones\' next full length record was released almost twenty years later, after Jones decided "never to do an album again",<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Osborn |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7747522.stm |title=An audience with Grace Jones |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=26 November 2008 |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> changing her mind after meeting music producer [[Ivor Guest, 4th Viscount Wimborne|Ivor Guest]] through a mutual friend, [[milliner]] [[Philip Treacy]].

The lyrics to the song were written after a party in Venice.<ref name="guardian2010">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/apr/17/grace-jones-interview |title=Grace Jones: \'God I\'m scary.

The two ended up with 23 tracks. The album included autobiographical songs, such as "This Is", "[[Williams\' Blood]]" and "I\'m Crying (Mother\'s Tears)", an ode to her mother Marjorie. "[[Love You to Life]]" was another track based on real events and "[[Corporate Cannibal]]" referred to [[corporate capitalism]]. "Well Well Well" was recorded in memory of [[Alex Sadkin]], member of [[Compass Point All Stars]] who had died in a motor accident 1987. "Sunset Sunrise" was written by Jones\' son, Paulo; the song ponders the relationship between mankind and mother nature. Four songs were removed from the album, "The Key to Funky", "Body Phenomenon", "Sister Sister" and "Misery".

===Voice and music===
Jones has a [[contralto]] vocal range. She sings in two modes: either in her monotone speak-sing voice as in songs such as "[[Private Life]]", "[[Walking in the Rain (Flash and the Pan song)|Walking in the Rain]]" and "[[The Apple Stretching]]", or in an almost-[[soprano]] mode in songs such as "[[La Vie en Rose]]", "[[Slave to the Rhythm (Grace Jones song)|Slave to the Rhythm]]", and "[[Victor Should Have Been a Jazz Musician]]". Jones\' voice spans two and a half octaves.<ref name="clashmusic"/>

While her early music was rooted in the [[disco]] genre, she opted for a [[New wave music|new wave]] sound in 1980s. She recorded a series of albums 1980\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[Warm Leatherette (album)|Warm Leatherette]]\'\' through 1982\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'[[Living My Life (album)|Living My Life]]\'\'. Backed by the Jamaica [[rhythm section]] duo [[Sly and Robbie]], her music during this era was described as a hybrid of "rock, [[funk]], [[post-punk]], pop and reggae." This hybrid influenced a variety of [[alternative rock|alternative music]] artists, including [[Massive Attack]], [[Todd Terje]], [[Gorillaz]], [[Hot Chip]], and [[LCD Soundsystem]].<ref name="p4k-review1"/>

==Personal life==
Jones\' relationship with her father was strained; he was strict and felt forced to disassociate himself from her because the church refused to make him a bishop as long as he was associated with his daughter.

Jones died on 7 May 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Winston Jones Obituary|url=http://obits.syracuse.com/obituaries/syracuse/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&pid=109731509#fbLoggedOut|publisher=Syracuse.com|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> Her mother, Marjorie, always supported Jones\' career (she sings on "[[Williams\' Blood]]" and "[[My Jamaican Guy]]") but could not be publicly associated with her music.<ref name="Sawyer" /> Marjorie\'s father, William, was also a musician, and played with [[Nat King Cole]].<ref name="Sawyer" />

\'\'\'Hamilton Frederick Bohannon\'\'\' (born March 7, 1942), often credited and known professionally simply as \'\'\'Bohannon\'\'\', is an [[United States|American]] [[percussionist]], [[band leader]], songwriter and [[record producer]], who was one of the leading figures in 1970s [[disco]] music.<ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hamilton-bohannon-mn0000664093 Biography by Ron Wynn at Allmusic.com].  Retrieved 28 January 2013</ref>

== Life and career==
He was born in [[Newnan, Georgia|Newnan]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and learned the [[drums]] at school.  He began playing in local [[band (music)|bands]], one of which featured guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]], before graduating from [[Clark Atlanta University|Clark College, Atlanta]] with a degree in music and secondary education.<ref name=hna>[http://www.hnarecords.com/book.html  Official biography at HNA Records].

Smallwood, \'\'Bohannon emerges as disco heavyweight\'\', \'\'Jet\'\' magazine, 26 January 1978, pp.62,65].  Retrieved 28 January 2013</ref>  After a brief period as a schoolteacher, he was recruited in 1964 as drummer in 13-year-old [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s touring band.  He moved to [[Detroit]] in 1967, where he was employed by [[Motown Records|Motown]] as the leader and [[arrangement|arranger]] of Bohannon & The Motown Sound, who provided backing for many of the [[record label|label]]\'s top [[musician|acts]] on tour, including Stevie Wonder, [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[Diana Ross and the Supremes]], [[The Four Tops]] and others.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=hna/>  

When Motown moved from Detroit to [[Los Angeles]], Bohannon stayed behind to form his own ensemble, featuring members of local band, The Fabulous Counts and including such musicians as [[Ray Parker Jr.]] and [[Dennis Coffey]].<ref name=jet/><ref name=soulwalking>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Hamilton%20Bohannon.html  Biography at SoulWalking.com]. Retrieved 28 January 2013</ref>   He signed in 1972 with the [[Dakar Records|Dakar]] label run by producer [[Carl Davis (record producer)|Carl Davis]], and released his debut album \'\'[[Stop & Go]]\'\' in early 1973.  This was followed by five more albums for the label over the next two years, on which he "perfected his formula of heavy, thudding bass accents and aggressive rhythms".<ref name=allmusic/>  Although several of his tracks were [[nightclub|club]] [[chart-topper|hits]], he had limited [[record chart|chart]] success.  His first hit single, in 1974, was "South African Man", which reached no.78 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]] but had more success in the UK, where it reached no.22 on the [[UK singles chart|pop chart]].  This was followed up in 1975 by "Foot Stompin Music" - his only record to reach the US [[Hot 100]] - and "Disco Stomp", his biggest hit in the UK where it reached number 6.<ref name="whitburnr&b"/><ref name="betts"/>  

In 1976, Bohannon signed to [[Mercury Records]] and two years later had one of his biggest successes with "Let\xe2\x80\x99s Start The Dance," which reached no.9 on the [[R&B chart]]<ref name="whitburnr&b"/> and no.7 on the disco chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=38}}</ref> "Let\'s Start the Dance" featured [[singing|singer]] [[Caroline Crawford|Carolyn Crawford]], whose subsequent [[solo (music)|albums]] Bohannon went on to [[record producer|produce]].  In 1981, a new mix of "Let\'s Start the Dance" was successful on the dance charts.<ref name=allmusic/>  In 1980 he established Phase II Records,<ref name=soulwalking/> and continued to have minor hits on the R&B chart for the next three years, using new vocalists [[Liz Lands]] and Altrinna Grayson.<ref name="whitburnr&b"/>  He signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984 and released several more albums.<ref name=allmusic/>  His last album, \'\'It\'s Time To Jam\'\', was issued on the South Bound label in 1990.<ref name=soulwalking/>

Much of his [[music]] has been widely [[Sampling (music)|sample]]d, most notably on Chicago DJ/producer [[Paul Johnson (producer)|Paul Johnson]]\'s 1999 hit "Get Get Down" which heavily sampled Bohannon\'s "Me and the Gang."  Other musicians who have used samples of his music include [[Jay Z]], [[Digable Planets]], and [[Snoop Dogg]].  His name was also mentioned in the [[Tom Tom Club]] song "[[Genius of Love]]."  His composition "[[Ooh!]]" was included on [[Mary J. Blige]]\'s album \'\'[[Love & Life (Mary J. Blige album)|Love & Life]]\'\' in 2003.<ref name=hna/>

In recent years Bohannon has produced a new singer, Governor, on [[Atlantic Records]], as well as working on material with his son, Hamilton Bohannon II and publishing an [[audiobook]] memoir of his early years in the music business, \'\'Bohannon Speaks from the Beginning\'\'.<ref name=hna/><ref name=soulwalking/> 

Bohannon is a devout [[Christian]]<ref name=hna/> and dedicated his album \'\'Dance Your Ass Off\'\' to "God and His Son, Jesus Christ". The album also included a disclaimer that "The word \'ass\' is not used here in the sense of profanity."

}}
\'\'\'Heatwave\'\'\' is an international [[funk]]/[[disco]] band featuring [[United States|Americans]] [[Johnnie Wilder, Jr.]] and Keith Wilder (vocals) of [[Dayton, Ohio]], [[England|Englishman]] [[Rod Temperton]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Mario Mantese]] (bass), [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Ernest "Bilbo" Berger (drums), [[Jamaica]]n Eric Johns (guitar) and [[British people|Briton]] Roy Carter (guitar).

They were known for their successful songs "[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]", "[[Always and Forever (Heatwave song)|Always and Forever]]", and "[[The Groove Line]]".

==Heatwave\'s mainstream years==
Founding member Johnnie Wilder was an American serviceman based in [[West Germany]] when he first began performing; upon his discharge from the [[U.S. Army]], he stayed in Germany.  He sang in nightclubs and taverns with an assortment of bands while still enlisted.  By mid-year, he decided to relocate to the [[United Kingdom]] and through an ad placed in a local paper he linked up with [[songwriter]]/[[keyboardist]] [[Rod Temperton]].

Touring the [[London]] nightclub circuit billed as \'\'Chicago\'s Heatwave\'\' during the mid-1970s allowed them to refine their sound, adding a funk groove to disco beats. In search of a fuller sound vocally, Johnnie Wilder called upon his brother Keith Wilder (who was performing in a local band in Dayton, Ohio) to join the band on vocals.  The group signed to [[GTO Records]] in 1976 ([[Epic Records]] would handle GTO\'s releases in the states). They were paired in the studio with GTO house producer/session guitarist [[Barry Blue]] and rhythm guitarist Jesse Whitten. Rhythm guitarist Roy Carter replaced Whitten after Whitten was killed in a stabbing incident. They began creating their first album \'\'[[Too Hot to Handle (Heatwave album)|Too Hot to Handle]]\'\' in the fall of 1976.

Their third single, "Boogie Nights" from their debut album, in 1977 reached #2 on the British popular music charts in January and in America in November. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40">[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2010). \'\'The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\'\', 9th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 293.</ref> The group\'s debut album, \'\'Too Hot to Handle\'\', was released in the spring of 1977, giving Heatwave a #11 on the Hot 200 and #5 on the R&B charts, while the next single, the soul ballad "Always and Forever", reached #18 on the Hot 100 in April 1978 and #2 on the R&B charts. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40"/>

Continuing to use Barry Blue\'s production skills, Heatwave released their second album \'\'[[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|Central Heating]]\'\' in April 1978. Lead single "The Groove Line," reached #7 on the Hot 100 in July 1978. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40"/>

During the late 1970s the band changed.  At first Eric Johns quit the band and Billy Jones was his replacement as guitarist.  Then Rod Temperton quit the band.  Although Temperton would continue writing new songs for Heatwave, he soon became better-known for his [[songwriter|songwriting]] for other artists, penning award-winning songs for some of funk\'s biggest names, including [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[George Benson]].  He also wrote for [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Quincy Jones]], but his most famous partnership remains the one forged with [[Michael Jackson]], writing three songs for his 1979 [[Epic Records|Epic]] debut \'\'[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]\'\' - "Rock With You," "Off the Wall" and "Burn This Disco Out", and three songs for the 1982 \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\' LP, including the title track.

Despite these changes Heatwave were about to return to the studio, when Mantese attended a party at Elton John\'s house in London.  He was with his girlfriend, who decided to go home early from the party, reason unknown.  When Mantese arrived home, she was furious with him, perhaps from an incident that happened at the party and stabbed him.  The knife hit him in the heart and for several minutes, he was clinically dead.  When, after several months, he awoke from coma, he was blind, mute and paralysed in his entire body.  To date, he has no memory of this tragic event.  He decided not to press charges against his girlfriend, and moved in with her after leaving the hospital.  Mantese was replaced by bassist Derek Bramble. Adding keyboardist Calvin Duke to the group, and now working with new producer [[Phil Ramone]], Heatwave cut \'\'[[Hot Property (album)|Hot Property]]\'\', released in May 1979.

During the spring of 1979, Johnnie Wilder, Jr., suffered injuries in an [[auto accident]] while visiting family and friends in [[Dayton, Ohio]].  Although he survived, the accident left him [[paralyzed]] from the neck down and unable to continue performing with the group.  After the accident, Johnnie remained a co-producer of the group, along with Blue.

Determined to continue working with the band he had nurtured since the very beginning, Wilder participated with studio work and, during 1980, Heatwave recorded the \'\'[[Candles (album)|Candles]]\'\' LP, with Temperton again providing the songs, except stand out track "All I Am", written by  Blue\'s former writing partner [[Lynsey de Paul]]. The group recruited James Dean "J.D." Nicholas, who later became a member of the [[Commodores]], to handle vocals in concert.<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years">{{cite book

Heatwave\'s popularity was on the wane, though, as the November single "Gangsters of the Groove" proved to be their last popular music success, scoring number twenty-one in the U.S., and number 20 in the [[United Kingdom]] early in the New Year. But the album peaked at a mere number 71 in the United States in December 1980.

Heatwave\'s 1982 LP, \'\'[[Current (album)|Current]]\'\', marked yet another new era for the band, as they returned to producer Blue. The album managed only number 156 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], although it scored the band a number 21 success on the R&B charts, where Heatwave continued to be a strong presence. A Rod Temperton penned single, "Lettin\' It Loose," proved a minor success during August.

Derek Bramble quit the band at the end of 1982, like Roy Carter, for a career in production (he would go on to work with [[David Bowie]] on 1984s \'\'Tonight\'\' LP, and later masterminded [[Jaki Graham]]\'s breakthrough). J.D. Nicholas left to replace [[Lionel Richie]] as the lead singer of the [[Commodores]]. After this long series of departures, the remaining members of Heatwave effectively disbanded.

==Post 1988 Heatwave==
Silent since early 1983, Heatwave reconvened in a new line-up to record and release the album \'\'The Fire\'\' in 1988.  However, Keith Wilder was the only original member of the band present in this incarnation (although Billy Jones, who had joined the band in the late 1970s returned as well).<ref name="Discogs">[http://www.discogs.com/Heatwave-The-Fire/release/1725006 Heatwave- \'\'The Fire\'\' @ Discogs]</ref>  Meanwhile, that same year, Johnnie Wilder released a solo spiritual album \'\'My Goals on Light\'\'.  The Wilder brothers once again teamed up the following year for the [[gospel music|gospel]] album, \'\'Sound of Soul\'\'.  None of these late 1980s albums sold well, but Heatwave\'s recognition was revitalized in 1991, when a [[remix]] version of their "Mind Blowing Decisions" charted in the UK.  By the middle of the 1990s, Keith Wilder had again reformed the band. Joined by bassist Dave Williamson, keyboardists [[Kevin Sutherland]] and [[Sun (R&B band)|Byron Byrd]], guitarist [[Bill Jones]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2012}}, and original drummer Ernest Berger, the reborn Heatwave launched an American tour with a live album recorded at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in [[Hollywood]], arriving in 1997.

Heatwave released an extended club remix of "Boogie Nights" in 2002.  Keith Wilder is the lead singer of the current line-up (and the only remaining original member). The current touring line-up includes a host of lesser known musicians, including New Orleans keyboardist Jeremy Crump and Washington, DC keyboardist [[Elliot Levine]].

Johnnie Wilder died in his sleep at his home in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in May 2006.

\'\'\'Herbert Jeffrey\'\'\' "\'\'\'Herbie\'\'\'" \'\'\'Hancock\'\'\' (born April 12, 1940) is an American pianist, keyboardist, [[bandleader]] and composer.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254052/Herbie-Hancock | title=Herbie Hancock (American musician) | publisher=[[Encyclop\xc3\xa6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> Starting his career with jazz legend [[Donald Byrd]], he shortly thereafter joined the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] where Hancock helped to redefine the role of a jazz [[rhythm section]] and was one of the primary architects of the "[[post-bop]]" sound. He was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace synthesizers and [[funk]] music (characterized by [[syncopation|syncopated]] drum beats). Hancock\'s music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs "cross over" and achieved success among pop audiences. His music embraces elements of funk and [[soul music|soul]] while adopting freer stylistic elements from [[jazz]]. In his jazz improvisation, he possesses a unique creative blend of jazz, blues, and modern classical music, with harmonic stylings much like the styles of [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]].

Hancock\'s best-known solo works include "[[Cantaloupe Island]]", "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" (later performed by dozens of musicians, including bandleader [[Mongo Santamar\xc3\xada]]), "[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]", "[[Chameleon (composition)|Chameleon]]", and the singles "I Thought It Was You" and "[[Rockit]]". His 2007 [[tribute album]] \'\'[[River: The Joni Letters]]\'\' won the 2008 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], only the second jazz album ever to win the award, after \'\'[[Getz/Gilberto]]\'\' in 1965.

Hancock practices [[Nichiren Buddhism]] and is a member of the Buddhist association [[S\xc5\x8dka Gakkai|S\xc5\x8dka Gakkai International]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Reiss|first=Valerie|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Buddhism/2007/10/Herbie-Fully-Buddhist.aspx |title=Beliefnet Presents: Herbie Hancock on Buddhism, Buddhist, Jazz, Music |publisher=Beliefnet.com |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/24/entertainment/ca-hancock24 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=He\'s still full of surprises | first=Greg | last=Burk | date=February 24, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.daisakuikeda.org/sub/news/2013/jan/2013jan30-hancock-shorter-ikeda-jazz.html | work= | title=Hancock-Shorter-Ikeda Series on Jazz Published in Japanese | first= | last= | date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> As part of Hancock\'s spiritual practice, he recites the Buddhist chant [[Nam(u) My\xc5\x8dh\xc5\x8d Renge Ky\xc5\x8d|Nam Myoho Renge Kyo]] each day.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Buddhism/2007/10/Herbie-Fully-Buddhist.aspx?p=3 | work= | title=Herbie, Fully Buddhist | first=Valerie | last=Reiss | accessdate=October 13, 2013}}</ref> In 2013, Hancock\'s dialogue with Wayne Shorter and Daisaku Ikeda on jazz, Buddhism and life was published in Japanese.<ref>[http://www.daisakuikeda.org/sub/news/2013/jan/2013jan30-hancock-shorter-ikeda-jazz.html "Hancock-Shorter-Ikeda Series on Jazz Published in Japanese"].

On July 22, 2011, at a ceremony in Paris, Hancock was named [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]] for the promotion of Intercultural Dialogue. In 2013 Hancock joined the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] faculty as a professor in the [[UCLA]] music department where he will teach jazz music.<ref>{{cite press release

Hancock is the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. Holders of the chair deliver a series of six lectures on poetry, "The Norton Lectures", poetry being "interpreted in the broadest sense, including all poetic expression in language, music, or fine arts." Previous Norton lecturers include musicians [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[John Cage]]. Hancock\'s theme is "The Ethics of Jazz."<ref>{{cite web

== Early life and career ==

Hancock was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the son of Winnie Belle (Griffin), a secretary, and Wayman Edward Hancock, a government meat inspector.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Herbie-Hancock.html</ref> He attended the Wendell Phillips High School. Like many jazz pianists, Hancock started with a [[classical music]] education. He studied from age seven, and his talent was recognized early. Considered a [[child prodigy]],<ref name="Prodigy">{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/7924263/Herbie-Hancock-interview.html | title=Herbie Hancock interview |work=The Daily Telegraph  | date=August 3, 2010 | accessdate=February 1, 2012 | author=Hentz, Stefan}}</ref> he played the first movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]\'s [[Piano Concerto No. 26 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 \'\'(Coronation)\'\']] at a young people\'s concert on February 5, 1952, with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] (led by CSO assistant conductor George Schick) at the age of 11.<ref name="grove">{{GroveOnline|Herbie Hancock|Dobbins, Bill and Kernfeld, Barry|February 19|2007}}</ref>

Through his teens, Hancock never had a jazz teacher, but developed his ear and sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group [[the Hi-Lo\'s]]. He reported that:

<blockquote>
the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo\'s, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that\'s when I really learned some much farther-out voicings \xe2\x80\x93 like the harmonies I used on \'\'Speak Like a Child\'\' \xe2\x80\x93 just being able to do that. I really got that from [[Clare Fischer]]\'s arrangements for the Hi-Lo\'s. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept.... He and [[Bill Evans]], and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Gil Evans]], finally. You know, that\'s where it came from.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jazz-Rock Fusion, the people, the music|author=Coryell, Julie and Friedman, Laura|year=2000|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|page=204|ISBN=0-7935-9941-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XwWdk3x9u28C}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1960, he heard [[Chris Anderson (piano)|Chris Anderson]] play just once, and begged him to accept him as a student.<ref name="Mapleshade testimonial">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapleshaderecords.com/cds/56922.php|title=CHRIS ANDERSON|work=Review of \'\'Love Locked Out\'\'|publisher=Mapleshade Music|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Hancock often mentions Anderson as his harmonic guru. Hancock left [[Grinnell College]], moved to Chicago and began working with [[Donald Byrd]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]], during which period he also took courses at [[Roosevelt University]]. (He later graduated from Grinnell with degrees in electrical engineering and music. Grinnell also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1972.<ref name="grove" /><ref>The tune "Dr Honoris Causa" written by [[Joe Zawinul]] and performed by [[Cannonball Adderley]]\'s quintet is an ironic celebration of the honorary degree.</ref>) [[Donald Byrd]] was attending the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in New York at the time and suggested that Hancock study composition with [[Vittorio Giannini]], which he did for a short time in 1960. The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with [[Oliver Nelson]] and [[Phil Woods]]. He recorded his first solo album \'\'[[Takin\' Off]]\'\' for [[Blue Note Records]] in 1962. "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" (from \'\'Takin\' Off\'\') was to provide [[Mongo Santamar\xc3\xada]] with a hit single, but more importantly for Hancock, \'\'Takin\' Off\'\' caught the attention of [[Miles Davis]], who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], a member of the new band.

== Miles Davis Quintet (1963\xe2\x80\x9368) and Blue Note Records (1962\xe2\x80\x9369) ==
Hancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963,<ref name="grove" /> he joined Davis\'s [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet (1964-68)|Second Great Quintet]]. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. The [[rhythm section]] Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist [[Ron Carter]], 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. After [[George Coleman]] and [[Sam Rivers]] each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet would gel with [[Wayne Shorter]] on [[tenor saxophone]]. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles {{http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/13/miles-davis-second-great-quintet}}, and the [[rhythm section]] has been especially praised for its innovation and flexibility{{by whom|date=December 2013}}.

The second great quintet was where Hancock found his own voice as a pianist. Not only did he find new ways to use common chords, but he also popularized chords that had not previously been used in jazz. Hancock also developed a unique taste for "orchestral" accompaniment \xe2\x80\x93 using [[quartal harmony]] and [[Debussy]]-like harmonies, with stark contrasts then unheard of in jazz. With Williams and Carter he wove a labyrinth of rhythmic intricacy on, around and over existing melodic and chordal schemes. In the latter half of the 1960s their approach became so sophisticated and unorthodox that conventional [[chord progression|chord changes]] would hardly be discernible; hence their improvisational concept would become known as "Time, No Changes".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

While in Davis\'s band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a [[sideman]] with other musicians such as Shorter, Williams, [[Grant Green]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], Rivers, Byrd, [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Lee Morgan]] and [[Freddie Hubbard]].

His albums \'\'[[Empyrean Isles]]\'\' (1964) and \'\'[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]\'\' (1965) were to be two of the most famous and influential jazz [[LP (format)|LPs]] of the 1960s, winning praise for both their innovation and accessibility (the latter demonstrated by the subsequent enormous popularity of the \'\'Maiden Voyage\'\' title track as a jazz standard, and by the [[jazz rap]] group [[US3]] having a hit single with "[[Cantaloop]]" (derived from "Cantaloupe Island" on \'\'Empyrean Isles\'\') some twenty five years later). \'\'Empyrean Isles\'\' featured the Davis rhythm section of Hancock, Carter and Williams with the addition of Hubbard on [[cornet]], while \'\'Maiden Voyage\'\' also added former Davis saxophonist Coleman (with Hubbard remaining on trumpet). Both albums are regarded as among the principal foundations of the [[post-bop]] style.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
Hancock also recorded several less-well-known but still critically acclaimed albums with larger ensembles \xe2\x80\x93 \'\'[[My Point of View]]\'\' (1963), \'\'[[Speak Like a Child (album)|Speak Like a Child]]\'\' (1968) and \'\'[[The Prisoner (album)|The Prisoner]]\'\' (1969) featured [[flugelhorn]], [[alto flute]] and [[bass trombone]]. 1963\'s \'\'[[Inventions and Dimensions]]\'\' was an album of almost entirely improvised music, teaming Hancock with bassist [[Paul Chambers]] and two Latin percussionists, [[Willie Bobo]] and [[Osvaldo "Chihuahua" Martinez]].

During this period, Hancock also composed the [[Film scores|score]] to [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]\'s film \'\'[[Blowup]]\'\' (1966), the first of many [[film soundtrack]]s he recorded in his career.  As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then well known products as [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]]\'s [[Space Food Sticks]], [[Standard Oil]], [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] diet cola and [[Virginia Slims]] cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of [[F. William Free]] commercials for [[Silva Thins]] cigarettes.  Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency wouldn\'t let him.  He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track \'\'He Who Lives in Fear\'\' from his \'\'[[Tab (soft drink)|The Prisoner]]\'\' album of 1969.<ref> Hancock, Herbie & Dickey, Lisa  \'\'Herbie Hancock: Possibilities\'\' Penguin, 23 Oct 2014</ref>

Davis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock\'s tenure with the band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric [[Keyboard instruments|keyboards]] including the [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] at Davis\'s insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be instrumental in his future artistic endeavors.

Under the pretext that he had returned late from a honeymoon in [[Brazil]], Hancock was dismissed from Davis\'s band. In the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet. However, although Davis soon disbanded his quintet to search for a new sound, Hancock, despite his departure from the working band, continued to appear on Davis records for the next few years. Noteworthy appearances include \'\'[[In a Silent Way]]\'\', \'\'[[A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]\'\' and \'\'[[On the Corner]]\'\'.

Hancock left Blue Note in 1969, signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. In 1969, Hancock composed the soundtrack for the [[Bill Cosby]] animated children\'s television show \'\'[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]\'\'. Titled \'\'[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]\'\' (1969), the album was mainly an [[R&B]]-influenced album with strong jazz overtones. One of the jazzier songs on the record, "Tell Me a Bedtime Story", was later re-worked as a more electronic sounding song for the [[Quincy Jones]] album, \'\'[[Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!]]\'\' (1978).

Hancock became fascinated with accumulating musical gadgets and toys. Together with the profound influence of Davis\'s \'\'[[Bitches Brew]]\'\' (1970), this fascination would culminate in a series of albums, in which electronic instruments are coupled with acoustic instruments.

Hancock\'s first ventures into [[electronic music]] started with a sextet comprising Hancock, bassist [[Buster Williams]] and drummer [[Billy Hart]], and a trio of horn players: [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]] (trumpet), [[Julian Priester]] ([[trombone]]), and [[multireedist]] [[Bennie Maupin]]. [[Dr. Patrick Gleeson]] was eventually added to the mix to play and program the synthesizers. In fact, Hancock was one of the first jazz pianists to completely embrace electronic keyboards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The sextet, later a septet with the addition of Gleeson, made three albums under Hancock\'s name: \'\'[[Mwandishi]]\'\' (1971), \'\'[[Crossings (Herbie Hancock album)|Crossings]]\'\' (1972) (both on Warner Bros. Records), and \'\'[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]\'\' (1973) (released on [[Columbia Records]]); two more, \'\'Realization\'\' and \'\'Inside Out\'\', were recorded under Henderson\'s name with essentially the same personnel. The music exhibited strong improvisational aspect beyond the confines of jazz mainstream and showed influence from the electronic music of [[contemporary music|contemporary classical]] composers.

Synthesizer player Gleeson, one of the first musicians to play synthesizer on any jazz recording, introduced the instrument on \'\'Crossings\'\', released in 1972, one of a handful of influential electronic jazz/fusion recordings to feature synthesizer that year. On \'\'Crossings\'\' (as well as on [[Weather Report]]\'s \'\'[[I Sing the Body Electric (album)|I Sing the Body Electric]]\'\'), the synthesizer is used more as an improvisatory global orchestration device than as a strictly melodic instrument. An early review of \'\'Crossings\'\' in \'\'[[Downbeat magazine]]\'\' complained about the synthesizer, but a few years later the magazine noted in a cover story on Gleeson that he was "a pioneer" in the field of electronics in jazz. In the albums following \'\'The Crossings\'\', Hancock started to play synth himself, with synth taking on a melodic role.

Hancock\'s three records released in 1971\xe2\x80\x9373 later became known as the "Mwandishi" albums, so-called after a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name Hancock sometimes used during this era (\'\'Mwandishi\'\' is Swahili for \'\'writer\'\'). The first two, including \'\'[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]\'\' were made available on the 2-CD set \'\'Mwandishi: the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings\'\', released in 1994, but are now sold as individual CD editions. Of the three electronic albums, \'\'[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]\'\' is probably the most experimental since the ARP synthesizers are used extensively, and some advanced improvisation ("post-modal free impressionism") is found on the tracks "Hornets" and "Hidden Shadows" (which is in the [[time signature|meter]] 19/4).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} "Hornets" was later revised on the 2001 album \'\'[[Future2Future]]\'\' as "Virtual Hornets".

Among the instruments Hancock and Gleeson used were [[Fender Rhodes]] piano, [[ARP Odyssey]], [[ARP 2600]], [[ARP Pro Soloist]] Synthesizer, a [[Mellotron]] and the [[Moog synthesizer]] III.

All three Warner Bros. albums \'\'Fat Albert Rotunda\'\' (1969), \'\'Mwandishi\'\' (1971), and \'\'Crossings\'\' (1972), were remastered in 2001 and released in Europe but were not released in the US as of June 2005. In the winter of 2006\xe2\x80\x937 a remastered edition of \'\'Crossings\'\' was announced and scheduled for release in the spring.{{Update inline|date=November 2013}}

==From \'\'Head Hunters\'\' (1973) to \'\'Secrets\'\' (1976)==
{{See also|Head Hunters}}
[[File:HerbieHancock.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hancock playing in Vredenburg, Utrecht, Netherlands, December, 2006]]
After the sometimes "airy" and decidedly experimental "Mwandishi" albums, Hancock was eager to perform more "earthy" and "[[funk]]y" music. The \'\'Mwandishi\'\' albums \xe2\x80\x93 though later seen as respected early fusion recordings \xe2\x80\x93 had seen mixed reviews and poor sales, so it is probable that Hancock was motivated by financial concerns as well as artistic restlessness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Hancock was also bothered by the fact that many people did not understand avant-garde music. He explained that he loved funk music, especially [[Sly Stone]]\'s music, so he wanted to try to make funk himself.

He gathered a new band, which he called [[The Headhunters]], keeping only Maupin from the sextet and adding bassist [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|Paul Jackson]], percussionist [[Bill Summers (percussionist)|Bill Summers]], and drummer [[Harvey Mason]]. The album \'\'[[Head Hunters (album)|Head Hunters]]\'\', released in 1973, was a major hit and crossed over to pop audiences, though it prompted criticism from some jazz fans.

Despite charges of "[[selling out]]", [[Stephen Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] positively reviewed the album among other friendly critics, saying, "\'\'Head Hunters\'\' still sounds fresh and vital three decades after its initial release, and its [[musical genre|genre]]-bending proved vastly influential on not only jazz, but funk, [[Soul music|soul]], and [[hip hop music|hip-hop]]."<ref name="Headhunters \'\'Allmusic\'\' review">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r140166/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Headhunters Herbie Hancock|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2010|work=\'\'Allmusic\'\' review of \'\'Headhunters\'\'|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

Drummer Mason was replaced by [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]], and the band released a second album, \'\'[[Thrust (album)|Thrust]]\'\', the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two \'\'Head Hunters\'\' releases was released in 1975 as \'\'[[Flood (Herbie Hancock album)|Flood]]\'\'. The record has since been released on CD in Japan.) This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining the same level of commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called \'\'[[Survival of the Fittest (The Headhunters album)|Survival of the Fittest]]\'\' in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for \'\'[[Return of the Headhunters]]\'\', and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play live and record.

In 1973, Hancock composed his second masterful soundtrack to the controversial film \'\'[[The Spook Who Sat by the Door (film)|The Spook Who Sat by the Door]]\'\'. Then in 1974, he also composed the soundtrack to the first \'\'[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]\'\' film. One of his memorable songs, "Joanna\'s Theme", would later be re-recorded in 1997 on his duet album with Shorter, \'\'[[1 + 1 (album)|1 + 1]]\'\'.

Hancock\'s next jazz-funk albums of the 1970s were \'\'[[Man-Child]]\'\' (1975), and \'\'[[Secrets (Herbie Hancock album)|Secrets]]\'\' (1976), which point toward the more commercial direction Hancock would take over the next decade. These albums feature the members of the Headhunters band, but also a variety of other musicians in important roles.

== From \'\'V.S.O.P.\'\' (1976\xe2\x80\x93) to \'\'Future Shock\'\' (1983) ==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hancock toured with his [[V.S.O.P. (group)|V.S.O.P. quintet]], which featured all the members of the 1960s Davis quintet except Davis, who was replaced by trumpeter Hubbard. There was constant speculation that one day Davis would reunite with his classic band, but he never did so. VSOP recorded several live albums in the late 1970s, including \'\'[[VSOP: The Quintet|The Quintet]]\'\' (1977).

In 1978, Hancock recorded a duet with [[Chick Corea]], who had replaced him in the Davis band a decade earlier. Hancock also released a solo acoustic piano album titled \'\'[[The Piano (Herbie Hancock album)|The Piano]]\'\' (1979), which, like so many Hancock albums at the time, was initially released only in Japan. (It was finally released in the US in 2004.) Several other Japan-only releases have yet{{when|date=October 2013}} to appear in the US, such as \'\'[[Dedication (Herbie Hancock album)|Dedication]]\'\' (1974), \'\'[[VSOP: Tempest in the Colosseum|V.S.O.P.\'s Tempest in the Colosseum]]\'\' (1977), and \'\'[[Direct Step]]\'\' (1978). \'\'[[VSOP: Live Under the Sky|Live Under the Sky]]\'\' was a VSOP album remastered for the US in 2004, and included an entire second concert from the July 1979 tour.

From 1978 to 1982, Hancock recorded many albums consisting of jazz-inflected [[disco]] and pop music, beginning with \'\'[[Sunlight (jazz album)|Sunlight]]\'\' (featuring guest musicians including Williams and Pastorius on the last track) (1978). Singing through a [[vocoder]], he earned a British hit,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Albums such as \'\'[[Monster (jazz album)|Monster]]\'\' (1980), \'\'[[Magic Windows (album)|Magic Windows]]\'\' (1981), and \'\'[[Lite Me Up (album)|Lite Me Up]]\'\' (1982) were some of Hancock\'s most criticized and unwelcomed albums, the market at the time being somewhat saturated with similar pop-jazz hybrids from the likes of former bandmate Hubbard. Hancock himself had quite a limited role in some of those albums, leaving singing, composing and even producing to others. \'\'[[Mr. Hands (album)|Mr. Hands]]\'\' (1980) is perhaps the one album during this period, that was critically acclaimed. To the delight of many fans, there were no vocals on the album, and one track featured Pastorius on bass. The album contained a wide variety of different styles, including a disco instrumental song, a Latin-jazz number and an electronic piece, in which Hancock plays alone with the help of computers.

Hancock also found time to record more traditional jazz while creating more commercially oriented music. He toured with Williams and Carter in 1981, recording \'\'[[Herbie Hancock Trio (1982 album)|Herbie Hancock Trio]]\'\', a five-track live album released only in Japan. A month later, he recorded \'\'[[Quartet (Herbie Hancock album)|Quartet]]\'\' with trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]], released in the US the following year. Hancock, Williams and Carter toured internationally with Wynton and his brother, saxophonist [[Branford Marsalis]], in what was known as "VSOP II". This quintet can be heard on Marsalis\'s debut album on Columbia (1981). In 1984 VSOP II performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival as a sextet with Hancock, Williams, Carter, the Marsalis Brothers and the addition of a third member into the horn section by way of [[Bobby McFerrin]] contributing his unique vocal styling\'s.

In 1982 Hancock contributed to the [[Simple Minds]] album \'\'[[New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)]]\'\', playing a synthesizer solo on the track "Hunter and the Hunted".

In 1983, Hancock had a [[mainstream]] hit with the Grammy-award winning instrumental single "[[Rockit]]" from the album \'\'[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]\'\'. It was the first [[Jazz rap|jazz hip-hop]] song<ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JfrG1IKZ9f8C&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=4AWslJ9lpj&sig=hTQg7zbn9nfqHTGDgkmGWWi9P3g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Music Cultures in the United States: An Introduction|page=364 |last=Koskoff |first=Ellen |publisher=Routledge |location=[[New York]], [[NY]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-96588-8 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Q84TiHcqDqcC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=bThBgh0Mq0&sig=MddvMPrllD5sFktKF4wNeV9DDCY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Hip Hop Culture|page=114 |last=Price |first=Emmett George |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]] |year=2006 |isbn=1-85109-867-4 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HRmRqtD6oPgC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=jU98B9Oea9&sig=wpKZdsTxJwD37jSkyYA_1itBsnY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Rap music and street consciousness|page=109 |last=Keyes |first=Cheryl Lynette|publisher=Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |location=[[Illinois]] |year=2004 |isbn= 0-252-02761-2|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> and became a worldwide anthem for the [[breakdancer]]s and for the [[Hip hop|hip-hop culture]] of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3616743/Culture-quake-Rockit.html |title=Culture quake: Rockit |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |publisher=Telegraph |date=May 10, 2004 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monkinstitute.org/meet/herbiehancock.php |title=Meet \xe2\x80\x93 Herbie Hancock |publisher=Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> It was also the first mainstream single to feature [[scratching]], and also featured an innovative animated music video, which was directed by [[Godley and Creme]] and showed several robot-like artworks by [[Jim Whiting]].

[[Omnibus Press]] (ISBN 0711990751), 2002, p.447</ref> The video won in five categories at the inaugural [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. This single ushered in a collaboration with noted bassist and producer [[Bill Laswell]]. Hancock experimented with electronic music on a string of three LPs produced by Laswell: \'\'Future Shock\'\' (1983), the Grammy Award-winning \'\'[[Sound-System (album)|Sound-System]]\'\' (1984), and \'\'[[Perfect Machine (album)|Perfect Machine]]\'\' (1988).

During this period, he appeared onstage at the [[Grammy Awards]] with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], and [[Thomas Dolby]], in a synthesizer [[Jam band|jam]]. Lesser known works from the 1980s are the live album \'\'[[Jazz Africa]]\'\' (1987) and the studio album \'\'[[Village Life (album)|Village Life]]\'\' (1984), which were recorded with [[Gambia]]n [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] player [[Foday Musa Suso]].<ref>[http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/3feb50074a703d1a] {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> Also, in 1985 Hancock performed as a guest on the album \'\'[[So Red the Rose]]\'\' (1985) by the [[Duran Duran]] spinoff group [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]. He also provided introductory and closing comments for the [[PBS]] rebroadcast in the United States of the [[BBC]] educational series from the mid-1980s, \'\'[[Rockschool]]\'\' (not to be confused with the most recent \'\'Gene Simmons\' Rock School\'\' series).

In 1986 Hancock performed and acted in the film \'\'[[Round Midnight (film)|\'Round Midnight]]\'\'. He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]]. Often he would write music for TV commercials. "Maiden Voyage", in fact, started out as a cologne advertisement. At the end of the \'\'Perfect Machine\'\' tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.

As of June 2005 almost half of his Columbia recordings have been remastered. The first three US releases, \'\'Sextant\'\', \'\'Head Hunters\'\' and \'\'Thrust\'\', as well as the last four releases, \'\'Future Shock\'\', \'\'Sound-System\'\', the soundtrack to \'\'Round Midnight\'\', and \'\'Perfect Machine\'\'. Everything released in America from \'\'Man-Child\'\' (1975) to \'\'Quartet\'\' (1982) has yet to be remastered. Some albums, made and initially released in the US, were remastered between 1999 and 2001 in other countries. Hancock also re-released some of his Japan-only releases in the West, such as \'\'The Piano\'\'.

== 1990s to 2000 ==
[[File:Herbie Hancock-Chameleon Live.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hancock live in concert]]
After a break following his leaving of Columbia, Hancock, together with Carter, Williams, Shorter, and Davis admirer [[Wallace Roney]], recorded \'\'[[A Tribute to Miles]]\'\', which was released in 1994. The album contained two live recordings and studio recording classics, with Roney playing Davis\'s part as trumpet player. The album won a Grammy for best group album. He also toured with [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Dave Holland]] and [[Pat Metheny]] in 1990 on their \'\'[[Parallel Realities]]\'\' tour, which included a performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in July 1990.

Hancock\'s next album, \'\'[[Dis Is da Drum]]\'\', released in 1994, saw him return to [[acid jazz]]. Also in 1994, he appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]\'s compilation album \'\'[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]\'\'. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as "Album of the Year" by \'\'[[Time Magazine]]\'\'.

1995\'s \'\'[[The New Standard (album)|The New Standard]]\'\' found Hancock and an all-star band including [[John Scofield]], DeJohnette and [[Michael Brecker]], interpreting pop songs by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Beatles]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.

A 1997 duet album with Shorter, entitled \'\'1 + 1\'\', was successful; the song "Aung San Suu Kyi" winning the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Hancock also achieved great success in 1998 with his album \'\'[[Gershwin\'s World]]\'\', which featured inventive readings of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] standards by Hancock and a plethora of guest stars, including Wonder, [[Joni Mitchell]] and Shorter. Hancock toured the world in support of \'\'Gershwin\'s World\'\' with a sextet that featured [[Cyro Baptista]], [[Terri Lynne Carrington]], [[Ira Coleman]], [[Eli Degibri]] and [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]].

== 2000 to 2009 ==
In 2001 Hancock recorded \'\'[[Future2Future]]\'\', which reunited Hancock with Laswell and featured doses of [[electronica]] as well as [[turntablist]] [[Rob Swift]] of [[The X-Ecutioners]]. Hancock later toured with the band, and released a live concert DVD with a different lineup, which also included the "Rockit" music video. Also in 2001 Hancock partnered with Brecker and [[Roy Hargrove]] to record a live concert album saluting Davis and [[John Coltrane]], entitled \'\'[[Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall]]\'\', recorded live in Toronto. The threesome toured to support the album, and toured on-and-off through 2005.

[[File:Herbie Hancock 2006.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Hancock performing in concert, 2006]]
The year 2005 saw the release of a duet album called \'\'[[Possibilities]]\'\'. It featured duets with [[Carlos Santana]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and others. In 2006 \'\'Possibilities\'\' was nominated for Grammy Awards in two categories: "A Song for You", (featuring Aguilera) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]], and "Gelo No Montanha", (featuring [[Trey Anastasio]] on guitar, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance]], although neither nomination resulted in an award.

Also in 2005 Hancock toured Europe with a new quartet that included [[Benin]]ese guitarist [[Lionel Loueke]], and explored textures ranging from [[ambient music|ambient]] to straight jazz to [[African music]]. Plus, during the summer of 2005, Hancock re-staffed the famous Headhunters and went on tour with them, including a performance at The [[Bonnaroo]] Music & Arts Festival. This lineup did not consist of any of the original Headhunters musicians. The group included [[Marcus Miller]], Carrington, Loueke and Mayer. Hancock also served as the first artist in residence for Bonnaroo that summer.

Also in 2006 [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] (which bought out Hancock\'s old label, Columbia Records) released the two-disc retrospective \'\'[[The Essential Herbie Hancock]]\'\'. This set was the first compilation of his work at Warner Bros., Blue Note, Columbia and [[Verve Records|Verve]]/[[Polygram Records|Polygram]]. This became Hancock\'s second major compilation of work since the 2002 Columbia-only \'\'The Herbie Hancock Box\'\', which was released at first in a plastic 4&nbsp;\xc3\x97&nbsp;4 cube then re-released in 2004 in a long box set. Also in 2006, Hancock recorded a new song with [[Josh Groban]] and Eric Mouquet (co-founder of [[Deep Forest]]), entitled "Machine". It is featured on Groban\'s CD \'\'[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]\'\'. Hancock also recorded and improvised with guitarist Loueke on Loueke\'s 1996 debut album \'\'Virgin Forest\'\', on the [[ObliqSound]] label, resulting in two improvisational tracks \xe2\x80\x93 "Le R\xc3\xa9veil des agneaux (The Awakening of the Lambs)" and  "La Poursuite du lion (The Lion\'s Pursuit)".

Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell released a 2007 album, \'\'[[River: The Joni Letters]]\'\', that paid tribute to her work with [[Norah Jones]] and [[Tina Turner]], adding vocals to the album,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/hancock.html |title=Key figure: An interview with jazz legend Herbie Hancock|author=Andre Mayer | date=June 18, 2007 | accessdate=September 11, 2007 | work=CBC News}}</ref> as did [[Corinne Bailey Rae]]. [[Leonard Cohen]] contributed a spoken piece set to Hancock\'s piano. Mitchell herself also made an appearance. The album was released on September 25, 2007, simultaneously with the release of Mitchell\'s newest album at that time: \'\'[[Shine (Joni Mitchell album)|Shine]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jonimitchell.com/ |title=The Official Website of Joni Mitchell |publisher=Jonimitchell.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> \'\'River\'\' won the 2008 Album of the Year Grammy Award, only the second time in history that a jazz album received either{{disambiguation needed|date=October 2013}} honor. The album also won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, and the song "[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]" was nominated for Best Instrumental Jazz Solo.

On June 14, 2008 Hancock performed with others at [[Rhythm on the Vine]] at the South Coast Winery in [[Temecula, California]], for [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]]. The event raised $515,000 for Shriners Hospital.<ref name="aboutrotv">Shriners Hospitals for Children, [http://www.rhythmonthevine.org/index.cfm/id/2/About-ROTV/ "About Rhythm on the Vine"], Rhythm on the Vine, 2008.</ref>

On January 18, 2009, Hancock performed at the [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial|We Are One concert]], marking the start of [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugural]] celebrations for [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/obama-family-arrives-concert-lincoln-memorial/|title=Obama: People Who Love This Country Can Change It|publisher=Foxnews|accessdate=February 9, 2009 | date=January 18, 2009}}</ref> Hancock also performed [[Rhapsody in Blue]] at the 2009 [[Classical BRIT Awards]] with classical pianist [[Lang Lang (pianist)|Lang Lang]].

\'\'\'Hot Chocolate\'\'\' are a British soul band popular during the 1970s and 1980s, formed by Errol Brown and Tony Wilson. The act had at least one [[hit record|hit]] every year between 1970 and 1984 inclusive, and their song "[[You Sexy Thing]]" made the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in three decades.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Beginnings==
The band was originally named \'Hot Chocolate Band\' by Mavis Smith, who worked for the [[Apple Corps]] press office.  This was quickly shortened to Hot Chocolate by [[Mickie Most]].

Hot Chocolate started their recording career making a [[reggae]] version of [[John Lennon]]\'s "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", but [[Errol Brown]] was told he needed permission. He was contacted by [[Apple Records]], discovered that John Lennon liked his version, and the group was subsequently signed to Apple Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/377/errol_brown_a_fondent_farewell/ |title=ERROL BROWN: A Fondent Farewell |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  The link was short-lived as [[The Beatles]] were starting to break up, and the Apple connection soon ended.

In 1970 Hot Chocolate, with the help of [[record producer]] Mickie Most, began releasing tracks that became hits, such as "[[Love Is Life]]", "[[Emma (song)|Emma]]", "You Could Have Been a Lady" (a U.S. and Canadian hit for [[April Wine]]), and "I Believe in Love". All those releases were on the [[RAK Records|RAK]] [[record label]], owned by Most. Brown and bassist Tony Wilson wrote most of their original material, and also provided hits for [[Herman\'s Hermits]], "Bet Yer Life I Do", and [[Mary Hopkin]], "Think About Your Children". 
 
Gradually the five piece, [[Brixton]], [[London]] based, outfit started to become [[UK Singles Chart]] regulars. "[[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]", which featured a guest spoken vocal from [[Alexis Korner]], and "[[Emma (song)|Emma]]" introduced the act.

==Success==
It was in the [[disco]] era of the mid-1970s that Hot Chocolate became a big success. A combination of high production standards, the growing confidence of the main [[songwriting]] team of Wilson and Brown, and tight [[harmonies]] enabled them to secure further big hits such as "You Sexy Thing" and "Every 1\'s a Winner", which were also U.S. hits, peaking at #3 (1976) and #6 (1979), respectively. "Every 1\'s a Winner" featured a distinctive distorted guitar riff by Harvey Hinsley using a [[Roland GR-500]]. After Wilson\'s departure for a [[solo (music)|solo]] career, that included a 1976 album \'\'I Like Your Style\'\', Brown assumed songwriting duties.

In 1977, after 15 hits, they finally reached [[Chart-topper|Number One]] with "[[So You Win Again]]". It was one of the few of their recordings that was not written, at least partly, by Brown.<ref name="British Hit Singles"/> The track was a [[Russ Ballard]] composition.<ref name="British Hit Singles"/>

The band became the only group, and one of just three acts, that had a hit in every year of the 1970s in the UK charts (the other two being [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Diana Ross]]).<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book

The band eventually had at least one hit, every year, between 1970 and 1984.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>  Critically, they were often lambasted or simply ignored, and apart from [[compilation album|compilations]] their albums such as \'\'Cicero Park\'\' sold modestly.

The band continued well into the 1980s, and clocked up another big hit record: "It Started With a Kiss", in 1982, which reached Number 5 in the UK. In all, the group charted 25 [[UK Top 40]] hit singles. Their single "You Sexy Thing" became the only track that made British [[Record chart|Top Ten]] status in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

==Later years==
Its renewed appreciation can be credited in part to its appearances in a string of successful [[film]]s starting with the 1997 [[comedy]] \'\'[[The Full Monty]]\'\', and in a 1989 acne lotion commercial (featuring a young [[Patsy Palmer]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadablemovies.org/content/watch/clearasil-advert-1989-patsy-palmer-1980s-44030.htm |title=Download &#124; Clearasil Advert 1989 (Patsy Palmer) 1980s |publisher=Downloadablemovies.org |date= |accessdate=13 January 2012}}</ref> From the late 1980s onwards the group experienced a resurgence of credibility: [[Urge Overkill]], [[PJ Harvey]] and [[The Sisters of Mercy]] all added Hot Chocolate songs to their live sets,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book

| page= 196}}</ref> and [[Cud (band)|Cud]]\'s cover of "You Sexy Thing" featured in [[John Peel]]\'s [[Festive 50]].

When Hot Chocolate disbanded in 1986, Errol Brown began a solo career. Two of his singles made the UK Singles Chart - "Personal Touch" and "Body Rockin\'". Hot Chocolate had a hit in 1988 in Germany. "Never Pretend" was written by Harvey Hinsley and Susan Stuttard, and the vocalist was Grant Evelyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hot-Chocolate-Never-Pretend/release/1536964 |title=Hot Chocolate - Never Pretend (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-29}}</ref> The band\'s enduring popularity was verified when two [[compilation album]]s both reached #1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] (see below). In 2003, [[Errol Brown]] received the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]; and in 2004, the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for his contribution to British music.

In 1992, with new line-up (new lead singer Greg Bannis), manager and agent, Ric Martin, took control over the band\'s bookings and live appearances. Kennie Simon took over lead vocals in 2010 and Hot Chocolate continue to make [[concert|live appearances]] in the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-chocolate.co.uk |title=Home |publisher=Hot Chocolate |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}</ref>

\'\'\'Instant Funk\'\'\' were an American 1970s [[disco]] [[Musical ensemble|band]], best known for their disco classic, "[[I Got My Mind Made Up (You Can Get It Girl)]]".

==History==
Instant Funk came out of [[Trenton,New Jersey]] consisting of Raymond Earl, Scotty Miller and [[guitar]]ist Kim Miller. The group was then called The Music Machine and they were very successful as a back-up band for [[The Manhattans]], [[Bunny Sigler]] and also the TNJs. Throughout their careers, Instant Funk would be the back-up band for many stars, including [[Lou Rawls]], [[Loleatta Holloway]], [[The O\'Jays]], [[MFSB]], [[Curtis Mayfield]] and [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn Champagne King]] (they are the backing band on the [[hit single]], "Shame").

The group relocated to [[Philadelphia]] in 1976 to release its first [[album]], \'\'Get Down With the Philly Jump\'\', as they started to formulate their own sound. The group followed this album up with a release for former MFSB guitarist [[Norman Harris]]\' new [[record label]] [[Gold Mind Records|Gold Mind]], with front man Bunny Sigler entitled "Let Me Party With You".

The Gold Mind label folded, and Instant Funk\'s new cut "I Got My Mind Made Up" was transferred to the [[Salsoul Records|Salsoul]] label, which pushed the [[gramophone record|record]] heavily to all of the disco [[nightclub|clubs]]. The [[remix]] of this [[song]] by club [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Larry Levan]] and engineer Bob Blank quickly became the talk of [[Manhattan]]. "[[I Got My Mind Made Up]]" hit #1 on both the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and disco [[record chart|charts]] and #20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in the spring of 1979. The group\'s eponymous first [[album]] on Salsoul was also a hit, reaching #1 R&B and being certified [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.

Instant Funk initially stayed together to tour when Salsoul folded. They eventually disbanded, and Bunny Sigler went on to perform as part of [[The Trammps]].

Instant Funk collaborated and released a music video "I\'m Your Reflection" in 2013 with new R & B / Soul / Jazz artist [[Soul Artist, Shantel]] bio update to follow later.

==Life and career==
[[File:Isaac hayes 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 photo of Hayes taken by [[John H. White (photojournalist)|John H. White]].]]

===Early years===
Isaac Hayes, Jr. was born in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in [[Tipton County, TN|Tipton County]]. He was the second child of Eula (n\xc3\xa9e Wade) and Isaac Hayes, Sr.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/Isaac-Hayes.html Isaac Hayes Biography (1942-)]<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>

After his mother died young and his father abandoned his family, Isaac, Jr., was raised by his maternal grandparents,<ref name=Post20080810>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081001405.html |title=Isaac Hayes; Created Memphis Sound, \'Theme From Shaft\' |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= August 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-09-11 | first=Joe | last=Holley}}</ref> Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade, Sr. The child of a sharecropper family, he grew up working on farms in [[Shelby County, Tennessee]] and in Tipton County.

Hayes dropped out of high school, but his former teachers at Manassas High School in [[Memphis]] encouraged him to complete his diploma, which he did at age 21. After graduating from high school, Hayes was offered several music scholarships from colleges and universities. He turned down all of them to provide for  his immediate family, working at a meat-packing plant in Memphis by day and playing nightclubs and [[juke joint]]s several evenings a week in Memphis and nearby northern [[Mississippi]].<ref name=Post20080810/>

At age five Hayes began singing at his local church; he taught himself to play the piano, the Hammond organ, the flute, and the saxophone. His first professional gigs, in the late 1950s, were as a singer at Curry\'s Club in North Memphis, backed by [[Ben Branch]]\'s houseband.<ref name="soulsville">[http://books.google.es/books?id=XLdsRwpZ9oYC&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=sax++AND+%22Ben+Branch%22&source=bl&ots=RS2nrOrWhG&sig=bfbwuMpyRML_fdwDBP4-revj3aU&hl=es&ei=9IB5SsvOHZTNjAeDsPGnBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false Bowman, Rob \'\'Soulsville, U.S.A.: the story of Stax Records\'\' Music Sales Group, 2003 ISBN 0-8256-7284-8, ISBN 978-0-8256-7284-2] at Google Books</ref>

===Stax Records and \'\'Shaft\'\'===
Hayes began his recording career in the early 1960s, as a session player for various acts of the Memphis-based [[Stax Records]]. He later wrote a string of hit songs with [[songwriting]] partner [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]], including "You Don\'t Know Like I Know", "[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]", "[[When Something Is Wrong with My Baby]]" and "[[Hold On, I\'m A Comin\'|Hold On, I\'m Comin\']]" for [[Sam & Dave]]. Hayes, Porter and Stax studio band [[Booker T. & the M.G.\'s]] were also the producers for Sam & Dave, Carla Thomas and other Stax artists during the mid-1960s. Hayes-Porter contributed to the Stax sound made famous during this period, and Sam & Dave credited Hayes for helping develop both their sound and style. In 1968, Hayes released his debut album, \'\'[[Presenting Isaac Hayes]]\'\', a jazzy, largely improvised effort that was commercially unsuccessful.<ref name="contact">"[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/isaachayesx18x10x05 Ultimate Isaac Hayes (Can You Dig It?), Audio]". \'\'Contactmusic.com\'\'. Retrieved March 15, 2008.</ref>

His next album was \'\'[[Hot Buttered Soul]]\'\', which was released in 1969 after Stax had gone through a major upheaval. The label had lost its largest star, [[Otis Redding]], in a plane crash in December 1967. Stax lost all of its back catalog to [[Atlantic Records]] in May 1968. As a result, Stax executive vice president [[Al Bell]] called for 27 new albums to be completed in mid-1969; \'\'Hot Buttered Soul\'\', was the most successful of these releases.<ref name="contact" /> This album is noted for Hayes\'s image (shaved head, gold jewelry, sunglasses, etc.) and his distinct sound (extended orchestral songs relying heavily on organs, horns and guitars, deep bass vocals, etc.). Also on the album, Hayes reinterpreted "[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]" (which had been made famous by Dionne Warwick) into a 12-minute exploration. "[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]" starts with an eight-minute-long monologue<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perthetic.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/rip-isaac-hayes |title=RIP Isaac Hayes|publisher=Perthetic.wordpress.com |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> before breaking into song, and the lone original number, the funky "Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic" runs nearly ten minutes, a significant break from the standard three-minute soul/pop songs.

"Walk On By" would be the first of many times Hayes would take a [[Burt Bacharach]] standard, generally made famous as three-minute pop songs by Dionne Warwick or [[Dusty Springfield]], and transform it into a soulful, lengthy and almost [[gospel music|gospel]] number.

In 1970, Hayes released two albums, \'\'The Isaac Hayes Movement\'\' and \'\'To Be Continued\'\'. The former stuck to the four-song template of his previous album. [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler\'s]] "I Stand Accused" begins with a trademark spoken word monologue, and Bacharach\'s "[[I Just Don\'t Know What to Do with Myself]]" is re-worked. The latter spawned the classic "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)#Isaac Hayes|The Look of Love]]", another Bacharach song transformed into an 11-minute epic of lush orchestral rhythm (mid-way it breaks into a rhythm guitar jam for a couple of minutes before suddenly resuming the slow love song). An edited three-minute version was issued as a single.<ref name="discography" /> The album also featured the instrumental "Ike\'s Mood," which segued into his own version of "[[You\'ve Lost That Loving Feeling]]". Hayes released a Christmas single, "The Mistletoe and Me" (with "Winter Snow" as a [[B-side]]).

In early 1971, Hayes composed music for the soundtrack of the [[blaxploitation]] film \'\'[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]\'\'. (in the movie, he also appeared in a cameo role as the bartender of No Name Bar{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}). The title theme, with its wah-wah guitar and multi-layered [[symphonic]] arrangement, would become a worldwide hit single, and spent two weeks at number one in the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] in November. The remainder of the album was mostly instrumentals covering big beat jazz, bluesy funk, and hard Stax-styled soul. The other two vocal songs, the [[social commentary]] "Soulsville" and the 19-minute jam "Do Your Thing," would be edited down to hit singles.<ref name="discography">[http://staxrecords.free.fr/hayes.htm Isaac Hayes Discography]. \'\'The Stax Site\'\'. Retrieved March 15, 2008.</ref> Hayes won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the [[Theme from Shaft|"Theme from \'\'Shaft\'\']]", and was nominated for Best Original Dramatic Score for the film\'s score.

Later in the year, Hayes released a double album, \'\'Black Moses\'\', that expanded on his earlier sounds and featured [[The Jackson 5]]\'s song "[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]". Another single, "I Can\'t Help It", was not featured on the album.

In 1972, Hayes would record the theme tune for the television series \'\'[[The Men (TV series)|The Men]]\'\' and enjoy a hit single (with "Type Thang" as a B-side).<ref name="discography" /> He released several other non-album singles during the year, such as "Feel Like Making Love", "If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don\'t Want to Be Right)" and "Rolling Down a Mountainside". Atlantic would re-release Hayes\'s debut album this year with the new title \'\'In The Beginning\'\'.<ref>[http://www.musicstack.com/album/isaac_hayes/in_the_beginning_-_atlantic MusicStack] entries for \'\'In the Beginning\'\' show that the LP\'s contents are identical to those of \'\'[[Presenting Isaac Hayes]]\'\'.</ref>

Hayes was back in 1973 with an acclaimed live double album, \'\'Live At Sahara Tahoe\'\', and followed it up with the album \'\'Joy\'\', with the eerie beat of the 15-minute title track. He moved away from cover songs with this album. An edited "Joy" would be a hit single.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p83140|pure_url=yes}} Isaac Hayes \'\'Billboard\'\' chart history]. \'\'Allmusic.com\'\'. Retrieved March 15, 2008.</ref>

In 1974, Hayes was featured in the blaxploitation films \'\'[[Three Tough Guys]]\'\' and \'\'[[Truck Turner]]\'\', and he recorded soundtracks for both. \'\'Tough Guys\'\' was almost devoid of vocals and \'\'Truck Turner\'\' yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score was eventually used by filmmaker [[Quentin Tarantino]] in the \'\'[[Kill Bill]]\'\' film series and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show \'\'Jornal de Esportes\'\' on the [[Jovem Pan]] station.

Unlike most African-American musicians of the period, Hayes did not sport an Afro and instead chose to shave his head bald.

===HBS (Hot Buttered Soul Records) and bankruptcy===
By 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution. Hayes himself was deep in debt to [[Regions Financial|Union Planters Bank]], which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes\'s income and apply it towards his debts. Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through [[ABC Records]].{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=332-334}}

His new album, 1975\'s \'\'Chocolate Chip\'\' saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. "I Can\'t Turn Around" would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes\'s last album to chart top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all instrumental \'\'Disco Connection\'\' album fully embraced disco.

In 1976, the album cover of \'\'Juicy Fruit\'\' featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic "Storm Is Over". Later the same year the \'\'Groove-A-Thon\'\' album featured the singles "Rock Me Easy Baby" and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into [[bankruptcy]] in 1976, as they owed over $6 million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he\'d written, performed, and produced.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=334}}

===Basketball team ownership===
On July 17, 1974, Hayes, along with [[Mike Storen]], [[Avron Fogelman]] and [[Kemmons Wilson]] took over ownership of the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]] team the [[Memphis Tams]].<ref>[http://www.remembertheaba.com/MemphisMaterial/BuccaneersMemphisYearly.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>  The prior owner was [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Oakland A\'s]] baseball team.  Hayes\'s group renamed the team the [[Memphis Sounds]].  Despite a 66% increase in home attendance, hiring well regarded coach [[Joe Mullaney]] and, unlike in the prior three seasons, making the [[1975 ABA Playoffs]] (losing to the eventual champion [[Kentucky Colonels]] in the Eastern Division semifinals), the team\'s financial problems continued.  The group was given a deadline of June 1, 1975, to sell 4,000 season tickets, obtain new investors and arrange a more favorable lease for the team at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]].  The group did not come through and the ABA took over the team, selling it to a group in Maryland that renamed the team the [[Baltimore Hustlers]] and then the [[Baltimore Claws]] before the club finally folded during preseason play for the 1975-1976 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Memphis-Sounds.html |title=Memphis Sounds |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

===Polydor and hiatus, film work, and the Duke of New York===
In 1977, Hayes was back with a new deal with Polydor Records, a live album of duets with [[Dionne Warwick]] did moderately well, and his comeback studio album \'\'New Horizon\'\' sold better and enjoyed a hit single "Out The Ghetto", and also featured the popular "It\'s Heaven To Me".

1978\'s \'\'For The Sake Of Love\'\' saw Hayes record a sequel to "Theme from \'\'Shaft\'\'" ("Shaft II"), but was most famous for the single "Zeke The Freak", a song that would have a shelf life of decades and be a major part of the [[House music|House]] movement in the UK. The same year, [[Fantasy Records]], which had bought out Stax Records, released an album of Hayes\'s non-album singles and archived recordings as a "new" album, \'\'Hotbed\'\', in 1978.

In 1979, Hayes returned to the Top 40 with \'\'Don\'t Let Go\'\' and its disco-styled title track that became a hit single (U.S. #18), and also featured the classic "A Few More Kisses To Go". Later in the year he added vocals and worked on [[Millie Jackson]]\'s album \'\'Royal Rappin\'s\'\', and a song he co-wrote, "[[Deja Vu (Dionne Warwick song)|Deja Vu]]", became a hit for Dionne Warwick and won her a Grammy for best female R&B vocal.

Neither 1980s \'\'And Once Again\'\' or 1981\'s \'\'Lifetime Thing\'\' produced notable songs or big sales, and Hayes chose to take a break from music to pursue acting.

In the 1970s, Hayes was featured in the films \'\'Shaft\'\' (1971) and \'\'[[Truck Turner]]\'\' (1974); he also had a recurring role in the TV series \'\'[[The Rockford Files]]\'\' as an old cellmate of Rockford\'s, Gandolph Fitch (who always referred to Rockford as "Rockfish" much to his annoyance), including one episode alongside duet-partner Dionne Warwick. In the 1980s and 90s, he appeared in numerous films, notably \'\'[[Escape from New York]]\'\' (1981), \'\'[[I\'m Gonna Git You Sucka]]\'\' (1988), \'\'Prime Target\'\' (1991), and \'\'[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]\'\' (1993), as well as in episodes of \'\'[[The A-Team]]\'\' and \'\'[[Miami Vice]]\'\'. He also attempted a musical comeback, embracing the style of drum machines and synth for 1986s \'\'U-Turn\'\' and 1988s \'\'Love Attack\'\', though neither proved successful. In 1991 he was featured in a duet with fellow soul singer [[Barry White]] on White\'s ballad "Dark and Lovely (You Over There)".

===Return to fame and stardom===
In 1995, Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating Isaac Hayes in the comedy series \'\'[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]\'\'.

Hayes launched a comeback on the Virgin label in May 1995 with \'\'Branded,\'\' an album of new material that earned impressive sales figures as well as positive reviews from critics who proclaimed it a return to form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/319/bands_classic_interview_soul_icon_isaac |title=Isaac Hayes interview by Pete Lewis, \'Blues & Soul\' May 1995 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=2008-08-10 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> A companion album released around the same time, \'\'Raw and Refined,\'\' featured a collection of previously unreleased instrumentals, both old and new.

In a rather unexpected career move shortly thereafter, Hayes charged back into the public consciousness  as a founding star of [[Comedy Central]]\'s controversial \xe2\x80\x94 and wildly successful \xe2\x80\x94 animated TV series, \'\'[[South Park]].\'\' Hayes provided the voice for the character of "[[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]", the amorous elementary-school lunchroom cook, from the show\'s debut on August 13, 1997 (one week shy of his 55th birthday), through the end of its ninth season in 2006. The role of Chef drew on Hayes\'s talents both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character\'s penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. An album of songs from the series appeared in 1998 with the title \'\'[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]\'\'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000G2JM |title=Chef Aid: The South Park Album (Television Compilation) [Extreme Version&#93;: Darren Mitchell, James Hetfield, Marc Shaiman, Matt Stone: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> reflecting Chef\'s popularity with the show\'s fans, and the Chef song "[[Chocolate Salty Balls]]" became a number-one U.K. hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-one-hit-wonders.php |title=Featured Artists from the Official UK Charts Company |publisher=Theofficialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> However,  when \'\'South Park\'\' leaped to the big screen the following year with the smash animated musical \'\'[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]\'\', Hayes/Chef was the only major character who did not perform a showcase song in the film; his lone musical contribution was "Good Love," a track on the soundtrack album which originally appeared on \'\'[[Black Moses (album)|Black Moses]]\'\' in 1971 and is not heard in the movie<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000JKR8 |title=South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut: Various Artists: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref>

In 2000, he appeared on the soundtrack of the French movie \'\'The Magnet\'\' on the song "Is It Really Home" written and composed by rapper Akhenaton (IAM) and composer Bruno Coulais.

Hayes was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2002. The same year, a documentary highlighting Isaac\'s career and his impact on many of the Memphis artists in the 1960s onwards was produced, "Only The Strong Survive".

In 2004, Hayes appeared in a recurring minor role as the [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] [[Jaffa characters in Stargate#Tolok|Tolok]] on the television series \'\'[[Stargate SG-1]]\'\'. The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed independent film \'\'[[Hustle & Flow]]\'\'.  He also had a brief recurring role in [[UPN]]\'s \'\'[[Girlfriends]]\'\' as Eugene Childs (father of Toni).

===Scientology activism===
Hayes took his first Scientology course in 1993,<ref>[http://www.isaachayes.com/bio/bio-2.html]</ref> later contributing endorsement blurbs for many Scientology books over the ensuing years.
In 1996, Hayes began hosting The Isaac Hayes and Friends Radio Show on [[WRKS]] in New York City. While there Hayes became a client of  young [[vegan]] [[raw food]] chef [[Elijah Joy]] and his company Organic Soul, Inc. Hayes also appears in the Scientology film \'\'[[Orientation (film)|Orientation]]\'\'.

In 1998, Hayes and fellow Scientologist entertainers [[Anne Archer]], [[Chick Corea]] and [[Haywood Nelson]] attended the 30th anniversary of \'\'[[Freedom Magazine]]\'\', the [[Church of Scientology]]\'s investigative news journal, at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] in Washington DC, to honor eleven activists.<ref>{{cite web

In 2001, Hayes and [[Doug E. Fresh]], another Scientologist musician, recorded a Scientology-inspired album called \'\'The Joy Of Creating \xe2\x80\x93 The Golden Era Musicians And Friends Play [[L. Ron Hubbard]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leggett|first=Jonathan|title=Cult musicians|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=The Guardian|date=2006-03-25|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/mar/25/popandrock | location=London}}</ref>

In February 2006, Hayes appeared in a [[Youth for Human Rights International]] music video called "United". YHRI is a human rights group founded by the Church of Scientology.

Hayes was also involved in other human rights related groups such as the [[One Campaign]].
Isaac Hayes was crowned a chief in Ghana for his humanitarian work and economic efforts on the country\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. {{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Legacy===
The [[Tennessee General Assembly]] enacted legislation in 2010 to honor Hayes by naming a section of [[Interstate 40]] the "Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway". The name was applied to the stretch of highway in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] from [[Sam Cooper Boulevard]] in Memphis east to the [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]] line.

==\'\'South Park\'\'==
{{Main|Chef (South Park)}}
[[Image:ChefSP.jpg|frame|Isaac Hayes was the voice of [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] on \'\'South Park\'\'.]]
During the late 1990s, Hayes gained new popularity as the voice of [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] on the [[Comedy Central]] animated television series \'\'[[South Park]]\'\'. Chef was a soul-singing cafeteria worker for \'\'South Park Elementary\'\'. A song from the series performed by Chef, "[[Chocolate Salty Balls|Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)]]",  received international radio airplay in 1999.  It reached number one on the [[UK singles chart]] and also on the [[Irish singles chart]].  The track also appeared on the album \'\'[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]\'\' in 1998.<ref name="Chef\'s Bio">{{cite web| title = Chef - Character Guide - South Park Studios| url = http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/characters/chef| publisher = www.southparkstudios.com}}</ref>

===Scientology episode===
In the \'\'South Park\'\' episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", a satire of [[Scientology]] which aired on November 16, 2005, Hayes did not appear in his role as Chef. While appearing on the \'\'[[Opie and Anthony]]\'\' radio show about a month after the episode aired, Hayes was asked, "What did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on Scientology?", he replied, "One thing about Matt and Trey, they [[parody|lampoon]] everybody, and if you take that  serious, I\'ll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for two dollars.  That\'s what they do."

In an interview for \'\'[[The A.V. Club]]\'\' on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode. He said that he told the creators, [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], "Guys, you have it all wrong. We\'re not like that. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?" He then told them to take a couple of Scientology courses to understand what they do.  In the interview, Hayes defended \'\'South Park\'s\'\' style of controversial humor, noting that he was not pleased with the show\'s treatment of Scientology, but conceding that he "understands what Matt and Trey are doing."<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44132/2 A.V. Club interview of Isaac Hayes], January 4, 2006.</ref>

===Departure from \'\'South Park\'\'===
On March 13, 2006, a statement was issued in Hayes\'s name, indicating that he was asking to be released from his contract with [[Comedy Central]], citing recent episodes which satirized religious beliefs as being intolerant. "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins," he was quoted in the press statement. However, the statement did not directly mention Scientology. A response from [[Matt Stone]] said that Hayes\' complaints stemmed from the show\'s criticism of Scientology and that he "has no problem \xe2\x80\x93 and he\'s cashed plenty of checks \xe2\x80\x93 with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons or Jews."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/13/southpark-chef-quits.html|work=CBC|publisher=|author=|date=March 23, 2006|title=Isaac Hayes quits \'South Park\' citing religious intolerance}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4836286.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=|author=|date=March 23, 2006|title=South Park gets revenge on Chef}}</ref> Stone adds, "[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." Stone and Parker agreed to release Hayes from his contract by his request.

On March 20, 2006, Roger Friedman of [[Fox News]] reported having been told that the March 13 statement was made in Hayes\'s name, but not by Hayes himself. He wrote: "Isaac Hayes did not quit \'\'South Park\'\'. My sources say that someone quit it for him. ... Friends in Memphis tell me that Hayes did not issue any statements on his own about \'\'South Park\'\'. They are mystified."<ref name="Friedman-March2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188463,00.html|work=|publisher=Fox News|author=Roger Friedman|date=March 20, 2006|title=Chef\xe2\x80\x99s Quitting Controversy}}</ref>  Hayes then had a stroke.<ref name="mysanantonio.com"/>

In a 2007 interview, Hayes said he had quit because "they [Parker and Stone] didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me enough... They weren\xe2\x80\x99t that nice."<ref>[http://pagesix.com/2007/01/24/isaac-puts-chef-behind-him], The New York Post, January 24, 2007</ref>

The \'\'South Park\'\' season 10 premiere (aired March 22, 2006) featured "[[The Return of Chef]]", a thinly veiled telling of the affair from Parker and Stone\'s point of view. Using sound clips from past episodes, it depicts Chef as having been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] and urges viewers (via Kyle talking to the town) to "remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song" and not to blame Chef for his defection, but rather, as Kyle states, "be mad at that fruity little club for scrambling his brains." In the episode, the cult that brainwashed Chef is named the "Super Adventure Club" and is depicted as a group of child molesters who travel the world to have sex with prepubescent children from exotic places. In the end, Chef is unable to break free from his brainwashing and dies an extremely gruesome death, falling off a cliff, being mutilated by wild animals and shot several times. At the end of the episode he is shown as being resurrected as a cyborg in the style of the resurrection of [[Darth Vader]] at the end of \'\'[[Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]\'\'.

===After \'\'South Park\'\'===
Hayes\' income was sharply reduced as a result of leaving \'\'South Park\'\'.<ref name="Friedman-August2008">Roger Friedman, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,401321,00.html "Isaac Hayes\'s History With Scientology"], \'\'Fox News\'\', August 11, 2008</ref> There followed announcements that he would be touring and performing. A reporter present at a January 2007 show in New York City, who had known Hayes fairly well, reported that "Isaac was plunked down at a keyboard, where he pretended to front his band. He spoke-sang, and his words were halting. He was not the Isaac Hayes of the past."<ref name="Friedman-August2008"/>

In April 2008, while a guest on \'\'[[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|The Adam Carolla Show]]\'\', Hayes stumbled in his responses to questions \xe2\x80\x93 possibly as a result of health issues. A caller questioned whether Hayes was under the influence of a substance, and Carolla and co-host [[Teresa Strasser]] asked Hayes if he had ever used [[marijuana]]. After some confusion on what was being asked, Hayes replied that he had only ever tried it once. During the interview the radio hosts made light of Hayes\'s awkward answers, and replayed Hayes comments as sound drops \xe2\x80\x93 often simulating conversation with his co-hosts. Hayes stated during this interview that he was no longer on good terms with [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]].<ref>[http://podcast.971freefm.com/klsx1/1016244.mp3 Isaac Hayes interview, MP3 format]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}, FreeFM: The Adam Carolla Show, April 9, 2008</ref>

During the spring of 2008, Hayes shot scenes for a comedy about soul musicians inspired by the history of Stax Records entitled \'\'[[Soul Men]]\'\', in which he appears as himself in a supporting role. His voice can be heard in the film in a voice-over role as [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Bernie Mac]] (who died the day before Hayes), and [[Sharon Leal]]\'s characters are traveling through Memphis, Tennessee. His first actual appearance in the film is when he is shown in the audience clapping his hands as The Real Deal does a rendition of Hayes\'s 1971 hit song "Do Your Thing." His next appearance consists of him entering The Real Deal\'s dressing room to wish them luck on their performance and shaking hands with Louis Hinds (played by Jackson) and Floyd Henderson (played by Mac). During this scene, Hayes also helps Hinds reunite with his long-lost daughter Cleo (played by Leal). His final appearance in the film consists of him introducing The Real Deal to the audience.<ref name="Friedman-August2008"/> The film was released on November 7, 2008.

Two months after his death, the \'\'South Park\'\' episode "[[The China Probrem]]" was dedicated to him{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}.

\'\'\'The Isley Brothers\'\'\' ({{IPAc-en|\xcb\x88|a\xc9\xaa|z|l|i\xcb\x90}}) are an American musical group originally from [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], originally a vocal trio consisting of brothers [[O\'Kelly Isley, Jr.]], [[Rudolph Isley]] and [[Ronald Isley]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=PA207&dq=The+Isley+Brothers&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0U9SUZugCsWa0QHTzYCICw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=The%20Isley%20Brothers&f=false |last=Gulla |first=Bob |title=Icons of R&B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists Who Revolutionized Rhythm|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2008|isbn=978-0-313-34044-4|ref = harv}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/01/arts/pop-review-two-brothers-who-are-carrying-on-the-family-act.html The New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ghwwUyP1PuYC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=the+isley+brothers+footsteps+dark+new+york+times&source=bl&ots=oAISWGiQAD&sig=ytnB-UKyfMUHQg21npfZjIKFIeY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GL_9UY_sKKmOiAK31YG4Ag&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=the%20isley%20brothers%20footsteps%20dark%20new%20york%20times&f=false Google Books]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2012/11/alex_isley_isley_brothers.php LA Weekly]</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-06/entertainment/ca-56059_1_isley-brothers The Los Angeles Times]</ref> The group has been cited as having enjoyed one of the "longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music".<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|title=The Isley Brothers - Music Biography on Allmusic.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=0000766893|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref>

Alongside a fourth brother, Vernon, the group originally performed gospel music until Vernon\'s death a couple years after its original formation. After moving to the [[New York City]] area in the late 1950s, the group had modest chart successes during their early years, first coming to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, "[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]", written by the three brothers. Initially a modest charted single, the song eventually [[List of music recording certifications|sold over a million copies]]. Afterwards the group recorded modestly successful works for a variety of [[record labels|labels]], including the top 20 single, "[[Twist & Shout]]" and the Motown single, "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]" before recording and issuing the [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award-winning]] hit, "[[It\'s Your Thing]]" on their own label, [[T-Neck Records]].

Initially influenced by gospel and [[doo-wop]] music, the group began experimenting with different musical styles incorporating elements of [[rock music|rock]] and [[funk]] music as well as pop [[ballad]]ry. The inclusion of younger brothers [[Ernie Isley]] (lead guitar, drums) and [[Marvin Isley]] (bass guitar), and Rudolph\'s brother-in-law [[Chris Jasper]] (keyboards, synthesizers) in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a self-contained musical band. For the next full decade, the siblings recorded top-selling albums including \'\'[[The Heat Is On (Isley Brothers album)|The Heat Is On]]\'\' and \'\'[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]\'\'.

The six-member lineup of the band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]. Eldest member O\'Kelly died in 1986 and Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired for life in the [[Christian ministry]] in 1989. Ronald reformed the group two years later with Ernie and Marvin in 1991; five years later in 1996, Marvin Isley left the group due to complications with diabetes. The remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie would accomplish mainstream success with the albums \'\'[[Eternal (Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]\'\' (2001) and \'\'[[Body Kiss]]\'\' (2003), with the former album spawning the top twenty hit, "[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]". {{As of|2013}}, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.

Throughout their career, the Isley Brothers have had four Top 10 singles on the United States \'\'[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]\'\' chart. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40. Thirteen of those albums have been [[RIAA certification|either certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA]]. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions including being [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|inducted]] to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1992.<ref name="rockhall">{{cite web|title=The Isley Brothers|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-isley-brothers/|year=1992|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> Five years later, they were inducted to [[Hollywood\'s Rockwalk]] and in 2003, were inducted to the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].

==History==

===Origins and initial recordings===
The Isley Brothers originally came from Cincinnati, Ohio and were originally raised at the city\'s [[Lincoln Heights, Ohio|Lincoln Heights]] suburb, eventually settling at the satellite town of [[Blue Ash, Ohio|Blue Ash]] when they were teenagers. The brothers\' father, O\'Kelly Isley, Sr., a former [[United States Navy]] [[sailor]] and [[vaudeville]] performer from [[Durham, North Carolina]], and Georgia-reared mother Sallye, guided the elder four Isley boys in their singing while at church. Patterning themselves after groups such as [[Billy Ward and His Dominoes]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]], the brothers began performing together in 1954.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} Eventually the brothers landed a spot on [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]]\'s \'\'Amateur Hour\'\' where they won the competition, winning a watch.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} With Vernon on lead vocals, the quartet soon began touring all over the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern US regions]] performing in a variety of churches. When Vernon was thirteen, he was killed after a car struck him as he was riding his bike in his neighborhood. Devastated, the remaining trio disbanded.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}}

Eventually convinced to regroup, the brothers decided to record popular music and left Cincinnati for New York in 1957 with their parents\' blessings.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193\xe2\x80\x93194}} With Ronnie assuming the lead vocal position in the group, the group got into contact with Richard Barrett, who soon had the group in contact with a variety of New York record producers, eventually having their first records produced by [[George Goldner]], who recorded the group\'s first songs, including "Angels Cried" and "The Cow Jumped Over the Moon" for the Teenage, Cindy and Mark X imprints.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=194}} The songs were only regional hits, however. By 1959, the group landed a recording deal with [[RCA Records]]. Later that year, mixing their brand of gospel vocalizing and doo-wop harmonies, the group recorded their first composition together, "[[Shout (Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]", a song devised from a [[Washington, D.C.]] club performance in which the brothers had covered [[Jackie Wilson]]\'s "[[Lonely Teardrops]]".{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=194}} The original version of the song peaked at 47 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 and never reached the R&B chart. Follow-up recordings on RCA failed to chart and the brothers eventually left the label in 1961, later signing with [[Scepter Records]]. In 1962, the brothers scored their first top 40 hit with the [[Bert Berns]] song, "[[Twist & Shout]]", which reached number 17 on the Hot 100 and number 2 R&B, staying on the charts for 19 weeks.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=195}} The song had been produced by Berns for the brothers to teach then struggling producer [[Phil Spector]] how to produce a hit.<ref>[http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlanticstory.html David Edwards and Mike Callahan, \'\'The Atlantic Records Story\'\', (Feb. 1990)]</ref><ref>[http://www.bertberns.com/bio.html Bert Berns official website - Biography]</ref>

Moving their entire operations to [[New Jersey]],<ref name=Isley>Wilner, Paul. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40F1EF73F5F137B93C1A81788D85F438785F9 "Isley Brothers: A Family Affair"], \'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\', March 13, 1977. Accessed September 18, 2011. "WHEN Sallye Isley moved her brood of children from Cincinnati to Englewood in the summer of 1959, she was participating in a show-business phenomenon.... While their older brothers toured America, the younger Isley boys enrolled successively in Englewood Junior High and Dwight Morrow High School.... Right now, the brothers reside near enough to each other to keep in close touch. Ronald lives in Teaneck, Kelly Jr. in Alpine, Rudolph in Haworth and Ernie in Englewood."</ref> the brothers continued to struggle with recordings eventually forming [[T-Neck Records]] in 1964.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=196}} During that same time period, [[Jimi Hendrix]] began playing lead guitar for the brothers\' band. Bringing Hendrix with them in the studio, they recorded the song "[[Testify (The Isley Brothers song)|Testify]]". Later on, Hendrix contributed guitar to another Isleys single, "Move On Over and Let Me Dance", which was recorded for T-Neck through distribution with [[Atlantic Records]]. After neither song charted and Hendrix left them for good in 1965, the brothers signed with [[Motown Records]]. Earlier the following year, the group had their second top 40 hit single with "[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]". While the brothers\' recordings with Motown were more successful than in the brothers\' early works, they struggled to have a follow-up top 40 hit with the label. They left Motown in 1968.

===Major success===
Resurrecting their T-Neck label that year, the brothers signed a distribution deal with [[Buddah Records]] and issued "[[It\'s Your Thing]]" in February 1969. The song, which featured the first appearance of Marvin Isley on bass, became their biggest success to date reaching number 2 on the Hot 100 and number one on the R&B chart. The song\'s parent album, \'\'[[It\'s Our Thing]]\'\', reached number 22 on the [[Billboard 200|Pop LPs]] chart and "It\'s Your Thing" became their second million-seller and won them a Grammy Award. The release of "It\'s Your Thing" brought record label issues between the Isleys and Motown as Motown argued that the group recorded the song while still under their Motown contract. A 1975 court decision eventually ended in the Isleys\' favor.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=199}}

By 1971, the Isleys\' younger brothers Ernie Isley and Marvin Isley and brother-in-law Chris Jasper started to add musical input to the band\'s music, first performing on the Isleys\' \'\'[[Givin\' It Back]]\'\', which had the brothers reinterpreting rock songs mixing it with funk and gospel-oriented elements. They played an even bigger role in the music on the 1972 album, \'\'[[Brother, Brother, Brother]]\'\'. Both albums yielded top 40 hits including "[[Love the One You\'re With]]" and "[[Pop That Thang]]". By the end of their Buddah tenure in 1973, the brothers signed a distribution deal with [[Epic Records]] and made Ernie, Marvin and Chris official members. In 1973, the Isleys released \'\'[[3 + 3]]\'\', which included the top 10 hit single, "[[That Lady (song)|That Lady]]" and a UK Top 10 cover of "[[Summer Breeze (song)|Summer Breeze]]". Incorporating [[hard rock]] and [[folk rock]] as well as funk and [[soul music|soulful]] [[ballad]]ry, the album became their breakthrough hit, eventually selling over two million copies.

The following year\'s \'\'[[Live It Up (The Isley Brothers album)|Live It Up]]\'\' reached gold. In 1975, the brothers scored one of their most successful recordings to date with \'\'[[The Heat Is On (album)|The Heat Is On]]\'\', which featured the hits "[[Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)|Fight the Power]]" and "[[For the Love of You]]", and became their first to reach number one on the Pop LPs chart, also selling over two million copies, going double-platinum. The brothers would have more hit albums including \'\'[[Harvest for the World]]\'\', \'\'[[Go for Your Guns]]\'\' and \'\'[[Showdown (Isley Brothers album)|Showdown]]\'\', which either went gold or platinum and released several top 40 pop and R&B recordings and several popular album and radio cuts. By the release of 1979\'s \'\'[[Winner Takes All (album)|Winner Takes All]]\'\', the brothers had incorporated [[disco]] and [[quiet storm]] music into their work. The brothers\' final album under their six-member lineup, 1983\'s \'\'[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]\'\', sold over two million copies. By then, financial struggles, creative difficulties and other issues affected the group. Shortly after the success of \'\'Between the Sheets\'\', Ernie, Marvin and Chris left the Isley Brothers and formed [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]], later scoring the hit, "[[Caravan of Love]]".

===Later career===
In 1985, the original Isleys trio of Kelly, Rudy and Ronnie signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded and released the album, \'\'[[Masterpiece (Isley Brothers album)|Masterpiece]]\'\'. Shortly a year after its release, Kelly Isley died of a heart attack while battling cancer, in March 1986.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qbADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA52&lpg=PA52&dq=O%27Kelly+Isley,+Jr.+obituary&source=bl&ots=XwoI_MA6Nu&sig=GBwiaAM3prl6jrRju3aoRYCaLQk&hl=en&ei=YN90S--uLcGQtgf52smaCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=O\'Kelly Isley, 48, Of The Isley Bros.

"He was 48 years old and lived in Alpine. Born Dec. 25, 1937, Mr. Isley grew up in Cincinnati and began his musical career singing gospel with his brothers, who performed with their mother accompanying them on piano."</ref> The remaining duo of Ron and Rudy released the [[Angela Winbush]]-produced albums, \'\'[[Smooth Sailin\']]\'\' in 1987 and \'\'[[Spend the Night (The Isley Brothers album)|Spend the Night]]\'\' in 1989. Shortly after the latter release, Rudy retired from the music industry and followed life in the [[Christian ministry|ministry]]. Ron put the group on a brief hiatus in 1990 while he recorded solo material. In 1991, Ron revived the group; Ernie Isley and brother Marvin returned to the fold. that year they released the album, \'\'[[Tracks of Life]]\'\'. Five years later, Ron Isley gained popularity as video villain Frank Biggs (or Mr. Biggs) in the music video for [[R. Kelly]]\'s hit, "[[Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)]]", which included the Isley Brothers as featured artists. The success of the song and its video helped the brothers\' 1996 album, \'\'[[Mission to Please]]\'\' reach platinum status.

That same year, Marvin Isley\'s career ended after a bout with diabetes forced him to have both of his legs amputated. Ron and Ernie have carried on as a duo from then on. In 2001, the duo released their best-selling album in years with the \'\'[[Eternal (Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]\'\' album, which sold over two million copies and featured the top 20 hit single, "[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]", making The Isley Brothers the only act to reach the Hot 100 (in fact, that chart\'s top 40) during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  Two years later, the brothers\' \'\'[[Body Kiss]]\'\' album peaked at number-one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 album chart, becoming their second to reach the position and the first to do so since \'\'The Heat Is On\'\'. Their next two released albums included 2006\'s \'\'[[Baby Makin\' Music]]\'\' and the 2007 holiday album, \'\'I\'ll Be Home for Christmas\'\'. In 2007, the Isleys\' career was interrupted by Ron Isley\'s three-year prison sentence for [[tax evasion]].<ref name=3years>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/id/14681264/ns/today-entertainment/t/singer-ronald-isley-gets-years-prison/#.UVRKkTfKSSo |title=Singer Ronald Isley gets 3 years in prison |publisher=Today.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> He was released in 2010.

A year later, Ron and Ernie reunited and have since performed on the road.

In 1993 \'\'The Isley Brothers\'\' song \'\'[[Footsteps in the Dark]]\'\' was sampled by hip hop artist [[Ice Cube]] for the hit single \'\'[[It Was A Good Day]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube, "It Was A Good Day"|first=Steven|last=Hyden|date=October 25, 2011|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/ice-cube-it-was-a-good-day,63931/|work=[[The A.V.

In 1994, "The Isley Brothers" song "[[Between the Sheets (song)|Between the Sheets]]" was sampled by [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] for his hit single [[Big Poppa]]

Chris Jasper continued as a solo artist and producer, forming his own independent record label, Gold City Records. He has released ten solo albums since the breakup of [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]], including \'\'Inspired: By Love, By Life, By the Spirit\'\' in January 2013. In May 2014, Chris Jasper released "The One", the title track from his next CD scheduled for a late summer 2014 release.

\'\'\'James Joseph Brown\'\'\'<ref name=jbbirthname/> (May 3, 1933&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 December 25, 2006) was an American singer. One of the founding fathers of [[funk]] music and a major figure of [[20th century music|20th-century]] [[popular music]] and dance, he is often referred to as "The Godfather of [[soul music|Soul]]". In a career that spanned six decades, Brown influenced the development of several music genres.<ref>Wiegand, D. (December 26, 2006).

Brown began his career as a [[gospel music|gospel]] singer in [[Toccoa, Georgia]]. Joining an [[R&B]] vocal group called the Avons that later evolved to become [[The Famous Flames]], Brown served as the group\'s lead singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/james-brown/bio/ |title=James Brown Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref> First coming to national public attention in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] as a member of [[The Famous Flames]] with the hit ballads "[[Please, Please, Please]]" and "[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]", Brown built a reputation as a tireless [[live music|live performer]] with the singing group The Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. Brown\'s success peaked in the [[1960s in music|1960s]] with the [[live album]] \'\'[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]\'\' and hit singles such as "[[Papa\'s Got a Brand New Bag]]", "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]" and "[[It\'s a Man\'s Man\'s Man\'s World]]". During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly "[[Music of Africa|Africanized]]" approach to music-making that influenced the development of funk music.<ref name=jbmusicstyle>Collins, W.

==Early life==
Brown was born on May 3, 1933, in [[Barnwell, South Carolina]], to 16-year-old Susie (n\xc3\xa9e Behling; 1917\xe2\x80\x932003) and 22-year-old Joseph "Joe" Gardner Brown (1911\xe2\x80\x931993) in a small wooden [[shack]].<ref name="jbancestry">{{cite web |url=http://genealogy.about.com/od/aframertrees/p/james_brown.htm |title=Ancestry of James Brown |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref> Brown\'s name was supposed to have been Joseph James Brown, Jr.; however, his first and middle names were mistakenly reversed on his [[birth certificate]].<ref name=jbbirthname>James Brown.

Brown managed to stay in school until sixth grade.

Brown began singing in talent shows as a young child, first appearing at Augusta\'s Lenox Theater in 1944, winning the show after singing the ballad "So Long".{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=11}} While in Augusta, Brown performed [[clogging|buck dances]] for change to entertain troops from [[Camp Gordon]] at the start of World War II as their convoys traveled over a canal bridge from near his aunt\'s home.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=11}} Brown learned how to play piano, guitar and harmonica during this period.

==Music career==

===The Famous Flames===
{{main|The Famous Flames}}
Brown joined Byrd\'s group, which highlighted under two names, as an [[a cappella]] gospel group called the Gospel Starlighters, and an R&B band known as the Avons.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=17}} Brown had allegedly joined the band after one of the group\'s members, Troy Collins, was killed.<ref name="birthoffunk">{{cite web |url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/trace-the-birth-of-funk-back-to-james-brown |title=Trace the birth of funk back to James Brown |work=Goldmine Magazine |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref> With Brown and Byrd, the group consisted of Sylvester Keels, Doyle Oglesby, Fred Pulliam, Nash Knox and Nafloyd Scott. Influenced by R&B groups such as [[Hank Ballard]] and [[The Midnighters]], [[The Orioles]] and [[Billy Ward and his Dominoes]], the group changed their name, first to the Toccoa Band, and then to the Flames.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=18}}<ref name="birthoffunk" /> Nafloyd\'s brother Baroy later joined the group on bass guitar and Brown, Byrd and Keels switched lead positions and instruments, often playing drums and piano. Johnny Terry later joined while Pulliam and Oglesby had long left.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=24}}

Berry Trimier became the group\'s initial manager booking them at parties near college campuses in the Georgia and South Carolina areas.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=19}} The group had already gained a reputation for being a live act when they renamed themselves the "Famous Flames".{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=21}} By 1955, the group had contacted [[Little Richard]], who was idolized by Brown, while performing in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]].{{sfn|White|2003|pp=228}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/mick-jagger-up-movie-james-3954885|title=Mick Jagger on Get On Up, his movie about James Brown - Irish Mirror Online|work=irishmirror|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref> Richard convinced the group to get in contact with Richard\'s manager at the time, Clint Brantley, at his nightclub.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=22}} Brantley agreed to manage them after seeing the group audition. {{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=25}} Brantley then sent them to a local radio station to record a demo session, where they performed their own composition "[[Please, Please, Please]]", which was inspired when Little Richard wrote the words of the title on a napkin and Brown was determined to make a song out of it.{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Merlis|2002|p=foreword}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macon.com/2014/07/26/3218915/midstate-residents-who-knew-godfather.html|title=News from Macon and Warner Robins, GA, and beyond - The Telegraph|publisher=|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref> The Famous Flames eventually signed with [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]\' [[Federal Records|Federal]] subsidiary in Cincinnati, Ohio and issued a re-recorded version of "Please, Please, Please" in March 1956. The song became the group\'s first R&B hit, selling over a million copies.<ref>White, Cliff (1991). Discography. In \'\'Star Time\'\' (p. 55) [CD liner notes]. London: Polydor Records.</ref> None of their follow-ups produced similar success. By 1957, Brown had replaced Clint Brantley as manager and hired Ben Bart, chief of [[Universal Attractions Agency]]. That year, the original Flames broke up after Bart changed the name of the group to "James Brown and The Famous Flames".{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=29}}

In October 1958, Brown released the ballad, "[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]", which hit number-one on the R&B chart in the beginning of 1959, becoming the first of seventeen chart-topping R&B hits.<ref name=jbinductee>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/hof/inductee.asp?id=56 |title=Inductees: James Brown, performer |work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum |accessdate=January 9, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, Brown recruited his first band, led by [[J. C. Davis]] and reunited with [[Bobby Byrd]], who joined a revived Famous Flames lineup that included [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Eugene "Baby" Lloyd Stallworth]] and [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]], with [[Johnny Terry]] sometimes coming in as the "fifth Flame". Brown,The Flames, and his entire band debuted at the [[Apollo Theater]] on April 24, 1959, opening for [[Little Willie John]].<ref name="birthoffunk" />{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=33}} Federal Records issued two albums credited to Brown and the Famous Flames. By 1960, Brown began multi-tasking in the recording studio involving himself, the Famous Flames and his band, sometimes named the James Brown Orchestra or the James Brown Band. That year, the band recorded the top ten R&B hit, "[[(Do the) Mashed Potatoes]]" on Dade Records, owned by [[Henry Stone]], under the pseudonym "Nat Kendrick & The Swans", due to label issues.<ref name=jbHStone>{{cite web |url=http://www.henrystonemusic.com/store/kendrick.htm |title=Nat Kendrick & The Swans. |publisher=Henry Stone Music, Inc |accessdate=January 28, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> As a result of its success, King president [[Syd Nathan]] shifted Brown\'s contract from Federal to King. While under King, Brown, under the Famous Flames lineup, released the album, \'\'Think!\'\' and the following year, released two albums with the James Brown Band earning second billing. With the Famous Flames, Brown sung lead on several more hits including "[[I\'ll Go Crazy (James Brown song)|I\'ll Go Crazy]]" and "[[Think (The "5" Royales song)|Think]]", songs that hinted at his emerging style.<ref name="birthoffunk" />

===Mr. Dynamite===
By 1962, Brown scored a hit with his band with their cover of the instrumental, "[[Night Train (composition)|Night Train]]", becoming not only a top five R&B single but also Brown\'s first top 40 entry on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, the ballads, "[[Lost Someone]]" and "[[Baby You\'re Right]]", the latter a [[Joe Tex]] composition, added to his repertoire and increased his reputation with R&B audiences. On October 24, 1962, Brown financed a live recording of a performance at the Apollo and convinced Syd Nathan to release the album, despite Nathan\'s beliefs that no one bought live albums due to the fact that Brown\'s singles were already bought and that live albums were usually bad sellers.

He also launched his first label, [[Try Me Records]], which included recordings by the likes of Tammy Montgomery (later to be famous as [[Tammi Terrell]]), Johnny & Bill (Famous Flames associates Johnny Terry and Bill Hollings) and the Poets, which was another name used for Brown\'s backing band.<ref name="birthoffunk" />

In 1964, seeking bigger commercial success, Brown and Bobby Byrd formed the production company, Fair Deal, linking the operation to the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] imprint, [[Smash Records]].<ref name="birthoffunk" /><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3779|pure_url=yes}} James Brown: Biography.] (2006). All Media Guide. Retrieved November 22, 2006.</ref> King Records, however, fought against this and was granted an [[injunction]] preventing Brown from releasing any recordings for the label. Prior to the injunction, Brown had released three vocal singles, including the blues-oriented hit, "[[Out of Sight (song)|Out of Sight]]", which further indicated the direction his music was going to take.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/james_brown.htm |title=The History of Rock \'n\' Roll: The Golden Decade 1954\xe2\x80\x931963 |accessdate=February 25, 2007}}</ref> Touring throughout the year, Brown and the Famous Flames grabbed more national attention after giving an explosive show-stopping  performance on the live concert film, \'\'[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]\'\'. The Flames\' polished choreography and timing as well as Brown\'s energetic dance moves and high-octane vocals upstaged the show from proposed closing act, [[The Rolling Stones]]. With a new deal with King, Brown released his composition, "[[Papa\'s Got a Brand New Bag]]", which became his first top ten pop hit and won Brown his first [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=pc51/> Later in 1965, Brown issued "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)|I Got You]]", which became his second single in a row to reach number-one on the R&B chart and top ten on the pop chart. Brown followed that up with the ballad, "[[It\'s a Man\'s Man\'s Man\'s World]]" which confirmed his stance as a top-ranking performer, especially with R&B audiences from that point on.<ref name=pc51/>

===Soul Brother No. 1===
By 1967, Brown\'s emerging sound had begun to be defined as [[funk]] music. That year, he released what some critics cited as the first true funk song, "[[Cold Sweat]]", which hit number-one on the R&B chart and became one of his first recordings to contain a drum [[Break (music)|break]] and also the first that featured a harmony that was reduced to a single [[chord progression|chord]].<ref>George, N. (1988). \'\'The Death of Rhythm & Blues\'\', 101. New York: Pantheon Books. ISBN 0-394-55238-5.</ref><ref>Vincent, R. & Clinton, G. (1996). \'\'Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One\'\', 123. New York: St. Martin\'s Griffin. ISBN 0-312-13499-1.</ref> The instrumental arrangements on tracks such as "[[Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose]]" and "[[Licking Stick-Licking Stick]]" (both recorded in 1968) and "[[Funky Drummer]]" (recorded in 1969) featured a more developed version of Brown\'s mid-1960s style, with the [[horn section]], guitars, bass and drums meshed together in intricate rhythmic patterns based on multiple interlocking [[riff]]s.

Changes in Brown\'s style that started with "Cold Sweat" also established the musical foundation for Brown\'s later hits, such as "[[I Got the Feelin\']]" (1968) and "[[Mother Popcorn]]" (1969). By this time Brown\'s vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] or [[melody]]. This would become a major influence on the techniques of [[rapping]], which would come to maturity along with [[hip hop music]] in the coming decades. Brown\'s style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: funky bass lines, drum patterns, and iconic guitar riffs.<ref>Slutsky, Allan, Chuck Silverman (1997). \'\'The Funkmasters-the Great James Brown Rhythm Sections\'\'. ISBN 1576234436</ref> The main guitar ostinatos for "[[Ain\'t It Funky]]" and "[[Give It Up or Turn It Loose]]" (both 1969), are examples of Brown\'s refinement of New Orleans funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. It\'s as if the guitar is an African drum, or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from "New Orleans\xe2\x80\x94through James Brown\'s music, to the popular music of the 1970s."<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 306). "Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music." Popular Music, v. 19, n. 3. Oct. 2000, p. 293-318.</ref> Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world\'s most [[sampling (music)|sampled]] recording artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/artist/James%20Brown/ |title=James Brown\'s Sample-Based Music and Cover Songs |publisher=WhoSampled |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref>

"Bring it Up" has an Afro-Cuban [[guajeo]]-like structure. In fact, on a 1976 version, Cuban bongos are used. All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure. Stewart states: "This model, it should be noted, is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle."<ref>Stewart (2000: 306).</ref>

It was around this time as the musician\'s popularity increased that he acquired the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]], "Soul Brother No. 1", after failing to win the title "King of Soul" from [[Solomon Burke]] during a Chicago gig two years prior.<ref name="a1984">Peter Guralnick, "Song of Solomon", \'\'The Boston Phoenix\'\' (March 6, 1984), Section 3:3.</ref> Brown\'s recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry, most notably groups such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.\'s]] as well as vocalists such as [[Edwin Starr]], [[David Ruffin]] and [[Dennis Edwards]] from [[The Temptations]], and [[Michael Jackson]], who, throughout his career, cited Brown as his ultimate idol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/jackson-attends-browns-public-funeral_1017673 |title=James Brown \xe2\x80\x93 Jackson Attends Brown\'s Public Funeral | accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref>

Brown\'s band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition. He was noted for his ability as a [[bandleader]] and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of [[jazz]]. Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis]] (the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones) led the band. Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]] provided percussive, deceptively simple [[riff]]s for each song, and [[Maceo Parker]]\'s prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances. Other members of Brown\'s band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, drummers [[John "Jabo" Starks]], [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[Melvin Parker]], saxophonist [[St. Clair Pinckney]], trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], guitarist Alphonso "Country" Kellum and bassist [[Bernard Odum]].

In addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown\'s output during this period included two more successful live albums, \'\'[[Live at the Garden (James Brown album)|Live at the Garden]]\'\' (1967) and \'\'[[Live at the Apollo, Volume II]]\'\' (1968), and a 1968 television special, \'\'[[James Brown: Man to Man]]\'\'. His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene. As Brown\'s music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well. Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including [[WCHZ (AM)|WRDW]] in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy.<ref name=pc51>{{Pop Chronicles|51|5}}</ref> In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station WGYW in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 \'\'[[Record World]]\'\' magazine. The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials. WJBE began on January 15, 1968 and broadcast a Rhythm & Blues format. The station slogan was "WJBE 1430 Raw Soul". Brown also bought [[WQLL|WEBB]] in [[Baltimore]] in 1970.

Brown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band. In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white [[adult contemporary]] audience, Brown recorded \'\'Gettin\' Down To It\'\' (1969) and \'\'[[Soul on Top]]\'\' (1970)--two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits\xe2\x80\x94with the Dee Felice Trio and the [[Louie Bellson]] Orchestra. In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with [[The Dapps]], a white [[Cincinnati]] band, including the hit "[[I Can\'t Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)|I Can\'t Stand Myself]]". He also released three albums of [[Christmas music]] with his own band.

===Godfather of Soul===
{{main|The J.B.\'s}}
[[File:James Brown Tampa.jpg|thumb|Brown after a concert in [[Tampa]] on January 29, 1972]]
In March 1970, most of Brown\'s mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to money disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of The Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968. Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd (who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period) subsequently recruited several members of the Cincinnati-based [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]], which included [[Bootsy Collins]] and his brother [[Catfish Collins|Phelps "Catfish" Collins]]; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band (including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown\'s outfit in December 1970) and other newer musicians, they would form the nucleus of [[The J.B.\'s]], Brown\'s new backing ensemble. Shortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]"; the song and other contemporaneous singles would further concretize Brown\'s influence in the nascent genre of funk music. This iteration of the J.B.\'s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release \'\'[[Love Power Peace]]\'\') due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins\' use of [[LSD]]; the Collins brothers would soon become integral members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], while a new lineup of the J.B.\'s coalesced around Wesley, St. Clair Pinckney, and drummer John Starks.

In 1971, Brown began recording for [[Polydor Records]] which also took over distribution of Brown\'s King Records catalog. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Andre Beeka, Fred Wesley & the J.B.\'s, Bobby Byrd, [[Lyn Collins]], [[Vicki Anderson]] and former rival [[Hank Ballard]], released records on the [[People Records|People]] label, an imprint founded by Brown that was purchased by Polydor as part of Brown\'s new contract. The recordings on the People label, almost all of which were produced by Brown himself, exemplified his "house style". Songs such as "[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]" by Bobby Byrd, "[[Think (About It)|Think]]" by Lyn Collins and "[[Doing It to Death]]" by Fred Wesley & the J.B.\'s are considered as much a part of Brown\'s recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name. That year, he also began touring African countries and was received well by audiences there. During the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], James Brown openly proclaimed his support of [[Richard Nixon]] for reelection of the presidency over Democratic candidate [[George McGovern]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/james-brown/soul-survivor/532/ |title=James Brown \xe2\x80\x93 Soul Survivor &#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=October 29, 2003 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref> The decision led to a boycott of his performances and, according to Brown, cost him a big portion of his black audience.<ref>Brown, James, with Bruce Tucker. James Brown: The Godfather of Soul (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company,1986), 233</ref> As a result Brown\'s record sales and concerts in the United States reached a lull in 1973 as he failed to land a number-one R&B single that year. Brown relied more on touring outside the United States where he continued to perform for sold-out crowds in cities such as London, Paris and [[Lausanne, Switzerland|Lausanne]]. That year, Brown also faced problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], charging he hadn\'t paid upwards of $4.5 million, five years earlier, the IRS claimed he owed nearly $2 million.<ref name="jbencyclopedia" />

In 1973, Brown provided the score for the [[blaxploitation]] film \'\'[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]\'\'. He also recorded another soundtrack for the film, \'\'[[Slaughter\'s Big Rip-Off]]\'\'. Following the release of these soundtracks, Brown acquired a self-styled nickname, "The Godfather of Soul", which remains his most popular nickname. In 1974, he returned to the No. 1 spot on the R&B charts with "[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]", with the [[The Payback|parent album]] reaching the same spot on the album charts; he would reach No. 1 two more times in 1974 including "[[My Thang]]" and "[[Papa Don\'t Take No Mess]]". Later that year, he returned to Africa and performed in [[Kinshasa]] as part of the buildup to [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]]. Admirers of Brown\'s music, including [[Miles Davis]] and other jazz musicians, began to cite Brown as a major influence on their own styles. However, Brown, like others who were influenced by his music, also "borrowed" from other musicians. His 1976 single "[[Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved)|Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)]]" (R&B #31) used the main [[riff]] from "[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]" by [[David Bowie]], not the other way around as was often believed. The riff was provided to "Fame" co-writers [[John Lennon]] and Bowie by guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]], who had briefly been a member of Brown\'s band in the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.allmovieguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=61:P The Whole Note: Under the Radar in \'06.]{{dead link|date=February 2014}} (2006).

Brown\'s "Papa Don\'t Take No Mess" would be his final single to reach the No. 1 spot on the R&B charts and his final Top 40 pop single of the 1970s, though Brown continued to occasionally have Top 10 R&B recordings. Among his top ten R&B hits during this latter period included "[[Funky President (People It\'s Bad)|Funky President]]" and "[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]", the latter song released in 1976 and aimed at musical rivals such as [[Barry White]], [[The Ohio Players]] and [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]]. Brown credited his then-second wife and two of their children as writers of the song to avoid concurrent tax problems with the IRS. Starting in October 1975, Brown produced, directed, and hosted \'\'[[Future Shock (TV series)|Future Shock]]\'\', an Atlanta-based television variety show which ran for three years.

===Decline and resurgence===
[[File:James Brown Live Hamburg 1973 1702730029.jpg|thumb|James Brown performing in Hamburg, 1973]]
Although his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground [[disco]] scene exemplified by DJs such as [[David Mancuso]] and [[Francis Grasso]] from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975\'s \'\'Sex Machine Today. \'\'By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&B. After "Get Up Offa That Thing", thirteen of Brown\'s late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&B chart, with only "[[Bodyheat]]" in 1976 and the disco-oriented "[[It\'s Too Funky in Here]]" in 1979 reaching the R&B Top 15 and the ballad "[[Kiss in \'77]]" reaching the Top 20. After 1976\'s "Bodyheat", he also failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Brown\'s concert attendance began dropping and reported disputes with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] caused Brown\'s empire to collapse. In addition, Brown\'s former band mates, including Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and the Collins brothers, had found bigger success as members of [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]\'s [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective. The emergence of disco also stopped Brown\'s success on the R&B charts as its slicker commercial style had superseded his rawer funk productions.

By the release of 1979\'s \'\'The Original Disco Man\'\', Brown was not providing much production or writing, leaving most of it to producer [[Brad Shapiro]], resulting in the song "It\'s Too Funky in Here" becoming Brown\'s most successful single in this period. After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981. It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J.B.\'s to the Soul Generals (or Soul G\'s). This band\'s name remained that way until his death. Despite a decline in record sales, Brown enjoyed something of a resurgence in this period starting with appearances in the feature films \'\'[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]\'\', \'\'[[Doctor Detroit]]\'\' and \'\'[[Rocky IV]]\'\', as well as guest starring in the \'\'[[Miami Vice]]\'\' episode "Missing Hours" (1987). In 1984, Brown teamed with rap musician [[Afrika Bambaattaa]] on the song "[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]". A year later he signed with [[Scotti Brothers Records]] and issued the moderately successful album, \'\'[[Gravity (James Brown album)|Gravity]]\'\', in 1986. It included Brown\'s final Top 10 pop hit, "[[Living in America (song)|Living in America]]", marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top 10 pop entry since 1968. Produced and written by [[Dan Hartman]], it was also featured prominently on the \'\'[[Rocky IV]]\'\' film and soundtrack. Brown performed the song in the film at Apollo Creed\'s final fight, shot in the Ziegfeld Room at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and was credited in the film as "The Godfather of Soul." 1986 also saw the publication of Brown\'s autobiography, \'\'James Brown: The Godfather of Soul\'\', co-written with Bruce Tucker. In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for "Living in America".

In 1988, Brown worked with the production team [[Full Force]] on the [[new jack swing]]-influenced album \'\'[[I\'m Real (James Brown album)|I\'m Real]]\'\'. It spawned his final two Top 10 R&B hits, "[[I\'m Real (James Brown song)|I\'m Real]]" and "[[Static (song)|Static]]", which peaked at No. 2 and No. 5, respectively, on the R&B charts. Meanwhile, the [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|drum break]] from the second version of the original 1969 hit "Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose" (the recording included on the compilation album \'\'[[In the Jungle Groove]]\'\') became so popular at hip hop dance parties (especially for [[break dancing|breakdance]]) during the late 1970s and early 1980s that hip hop founding father [[Kurtis Blow]] called the song "the national anthem of hip hop".<ref>[http://www.rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html Liner notes \xe2\x80\x93 Kurtis Blow presents: The History of Rap, Vol. 1.]{{dead link|date=February 2014}} Rhino Records.

===Final years===
[[File:Jamesbrown3.jpg|left|thumb|James Brown performing in June 2005]]
After his stint in prison during the late 1980s, Brown met Larry Fridie and Thomas Hart who produced the first James Brown biopic titled \'\'James Brown: The Man, the Message, the Music\'\', released in 1992. James Brown returned with the album \'\'Love Over-Due\'\' in 1991. It included the single "[[(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On]]", which peaked at No. 48 on the R&B chart. His former record label Polydor also released the four-CD box set, \'\'[[Star Time]]\'\', spanning Brown\'s career to date. Brown\'s release from prison also prompted his former record labels to [[reissue]] his albums on CD, featuring additional tracks and commentary by music critics and historians. That same year, Brown appeared on rapper [[MC Hammer]]\'s video for "[[Too Legit to Quit (song)|Too Legit to Quit]]". Hammer had been noted, alongside [[Big Daddy Kane]], for bringing Brown\'s unique stage shows and their own energetic dance moves to the hip-hop generation, with both Hammer and Kane listing Brown as their idol. Both musicians also sampled Brown\'s work, with Hammer having sampled the rhythms from "[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]" for his song, "Here Comes the Hammer", from his best-selling album, \'\'[[Please Hammer, Don\'t Hurt \'Em]]\'\'. Before the year was over, Brown, who had immediately returned to work with his band following his release, organized a pay-per-view concert following a show at Los Angeles\' [[Wiltern Theatre]], that was well received.
[[File:James Brown 2001.jpg|thumb|180px|Brown during the [[NBA All-Star Game]] jam session, 2001]]

On June 10, 1991 James Brown and a star-filled line up, performed before an audience at Los Angeles\' Wiltern Theater before a live Pay Per View at home audience.  James Brown: Living in America - Live! was the brainchild of Indiana Producer Danny Hubbard.
M.C. Hammer as well as Bell Biv Devoe, the Boys, En Vogue, C+C Music Factory, Quincy Jones, Sherman Hemsley and Keenen Ivory Wayans. Ice-T, Tone Loc and Kool Moe Dee performed paying homage to Brown. This was Brown\'s first public performance since his parole from the South Carolina prison system in February. He served 2 1/2 years of two concurrent six-year sentences for aggravated assault and other felonies.

Brown continued making recordings. In 1993, his album \'\'Universal James\'\' was released. It included his final \'\'Billboard\'\' charting single, "[[Can\'t Get Any Harder]]", which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of "I Feel Good" featuring [[Dakeyne]]. Brown also released the singles, "How Long" and "Georgia-Lina", which failed to chart. In 1995 Brown returned to the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]] and recorded \'\'[[Live at the Apollo 1995]]\'\'. It included a studio track titled "Respect Me", which was released as a single; again it failed to chart. Brown\'s final studio albums, \'\'I\'m Back\'\' and \'\'[[The Next Step (James Brown album)|The Next Step]]\'\', were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. \'\'I\'m Back\'\' featured the song "[[Funk on Ah Roll]]", which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. \'\'The Next Step\'\' included Brown\'s final single, "[[Killing Is Out, School Is In]]". Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown\'s concert success, however, remained unabated and Brown kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business", in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the [[PBS]] \'\'[[American Masters]]\'\' television documentary \'\'James Brown: Soul Survivor\'\', which was directed by [[Jeremy Marre]].

Brown celebrated his status as an icon by appearing in a variety of entertainment and sports events, including an appearance on the [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] pay-per-view event, \'\'[[SuperBrawl#SuperBrawl X|SuperBrawl X]]\'\', where he danced alongside wrestler [[Ernest Miller|Ernest "The Cat" Miller]], who based his character on Brown, during his in-ring skit with [[Robert Kellum|The Maestro]]. Brown was then featured in [[Tony Scott]]\'s short film, \'\'[[The Hire: Beat the Devil|Beat the Devil]]\'\', in 2001. Brown was featured alongside [[Clive Owen]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Danny Trejo]], and [[Marilyn Manson]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338768 \'\'Beat the Devil\'\'.] (2002). Internet Movie Database Inc. (IMDb).

The beginning of 2005 saw the publication of Brown\'s second book, \'\'I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul\'\', written with Marc Eliot. In February and March he participated in recording sessions for an intended studio album with Fred Wesley, Pee Wee Ellis, and other longtime collaborators. Though he lost interest in the album, which remains unreleased, a track from the sessions, "[[Gut Bucket (James Brown song)|Gut Bucket]]", appeared on a compilation CD included with the August 2006 issue of \'\'[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-thomson.net/worldfunk.html |title=Portfolio - Features |publisher=Charles Thomson |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref> He appeared at [[Edinburgh 50,000 \xe2\x80\x93 The Final Push]], the final [[Live 8]] concert on July 6, 2005, where he performed a duet with British pop star [[Will Young]] on "Papa\'s Got A Brand New Bag". He also performed a duet with another British pop star, [[Joss Stone]], a week earlier on the United Kingdom chat show \'\'[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]\'\'. Before his death, Brown was scheduled to perform a duet with singer [[Annie Lennox]] on the song "Vengeance" for her new album \'\'Venus\'\', which was released in 2007. In 2006, Brown continued his "Seven Decades of Funk World Tour", his last concert tour where he performed all over the world. His final U.S. performances were in San Francisco on August 20, 2006, as headliner at the Festival of the Golden Gate (Foggfest) on the Great Meadow at Fort Mason. The following day, August 21, he performed at Humboldt State University in Arcata, CA, at a small theatre (800 seats) on campus. His last shows were greeted with positive reviews, and one of his final concert appearances at the Irish [[Oxegen#2006 Festival|Oxegen festival in Punchestown in 2006]] was performed for a record crowd of 80,000 people. He played a full concert as part of the BBC\'s Electric Proms on October 27, 2006, at The Roundhouse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2006/jamesbrown/ |title=Electric Proms - James Brown The Godfather of Soul |publisher=BBC |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref> supported by The Zutons, with special appearances from Max Beasley and The Sugababes.

==James Brown Revue==

===Concert introduction===
Before James Brown appeared on stage, his personal [[Master of ceremonies|MC]] gave him an elaborate introduction accompanied by drumrolls, as the MC worked in Brown\'s various sobriquets along with the names of many of his hit songs. The introduction by Fats Gonder, captured on Brown\'s 1963 album \'\'[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]\'\' album, is a representative example:

===Concert repertoire and format===
[[File:James Brown.jpg|thumb|143px|right|Brown and MC Danny Ray during cape routine, BBC Electric Proms \'06 concert]]

James Brown\'s performances were famous for their intensity and length. His own stated goal was to "give people more than what they came for&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 make them tired, \'cause \'\'that\'s\'\' what they came for.\'"<ref>Guralnick, 231.</ref> Brown\'s concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&B [[Cover version|covers]] mixed in. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato (dance)|Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and backup singers (The Famous Flames) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear [[Tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedoes]] and [[cummerbund]]s long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown\'s own extravagant outfits and his elaborate [[Conk|processed hairdo]] completed the visual impression. A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or [[Marva Whitney]], and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show.

===Cape routine===
A trademark feature of Brown\'s stage shows, usually during the song "Please, Please, Please", involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show\'s longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown\'s shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to [[exhaustion]] during his performance. As Brown was escorted off the stage by the MC, Brown\'s vocal group, [[The Famous Flames]], continued singing the background vocals "Please, please don\'t go-oh-oh".<ref>Page, C. (January 2, 2007).

Brown performs a version of the cape routine over the [[closing credits]] of the film \'\'[[Blues Brothers 2000]]\'\' and on the \'\'[[T.A.M.I. Show]]\'\' (1964) in which he upstages the Rolling Stones. [[The Police]] refer to "James Brown on the \'\'T.A.M.I. Show\'\'" in their 1980 song "[[When the World Is Running Down, You Make the Best of What\'s Still Around]]."

===As band leader===
Brown demanded extreme discipline, perfection and precision from his musicians and dancers&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x94 performers in his Revue showed up for rehearsals and members wore the right "uniform" or "costume" for concert performances.<ref name=tangari>Tangari, J. (January 3, 2007). [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40233/James_Brown_19282006 James Brown, 1928\xe2\x80\x932006.]{{dead link|date=February 2014}} Pitchforkmedia, Inc.

{{quote|You gotta be on time. You gotta have your uniform. Your stuff\'s got to be intact. You gotta have the bow tie. \'\'You got to have it\'\'. You can\'t come up without the bow tie. You cannot come up without a cummerbund ... [The] patent leather shoes we were wearing at the time gotta be greased. You just gotta have this stuff. This is what [Brown expected] ...

Brown also had a practice of directing, correcting and assessing fines on members of his band who broke his rules, such as wearing unshined shoes, dancing out of sync or showing up late on stage.<ref name=jbfine>Burnett, B. (December 21, 2006). [http://www.hour.ca/music/music.aspx?iIDArticle=11069 James Brown: Audience with the Godfather] (interview). [[Hour (magazine)|The Hour]]. Retrieved January 9, 2007.</ref> During some of his concert performances, Brown danced in front of his band with his back to the audience as he slid across the floor, flashing hand signals and splaying his pulsating fingers to the beat of the music. Although audiences thought Brown\'s dance routine was part of his act, this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction. Brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules.<ref>Gottschild, B.D. (August 2000). James Brown: Godfather of dance. \'\'Dance Magazine\'\', 74(8), p. 54 (Document no. A63735725). Retrieved January 11, 2007 from the Biography Resource Center database.</ref>

Brown\'s demands of his support acts were, however, quite the reverse. As [[Fred Wesley]] recalled of his time as MD of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to "undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs. A sure set killer."<ref>Fred Wesley\'s sleevenotes to Honey & the Bees "Dynamite!" (Jamie4009) 1999</ref>

==Social activism==

===Education advocacy and humanitarianism===
Brown\'s main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his forced dropping out of the seventh grade for wearing "insufficient clothes". Due to heavy [[dropping out|dropout]] rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, "[[Don\'t Be a Drop-Out]]". Royalties of the song were donated to charity used for dropout prevention programs. The success of this led to Brown meeting with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] at the [[White House]]. Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free city-wide concert in Boston to maintain public order (over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence.). A lifelong Republican like his best friend, Ray Charles, James Brown gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans.<ref name="YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto">{{YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto}}</ref> Brown\'s outspoken support of President Nixon and the Republican Party in the election of 1972 led groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP and the National Urban League to launch a nationwide boycott of his businesses, at a time when Brown was the most successful Black entrepreneur in America (below). He was also harassed by J. Edgar Hoover and the IRS, probably because Hoover thought it "dangerous" that a young "Black radical" had the ear of the president.<ref name="YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto"/>

Throughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school. Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the I Feel Good, Inc. Trust to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren. His final single, "Killing Is Out, School Is In", advocated against murders of young children in the streets. Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta. A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years.

===Civil rights and self-reliance===
Though Brown performed at benefit rallies for [[civil rights]] organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs. In 1968, in response to a growing urge of [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War]], Brown recorded the song, "[[America Is My Home]]". In the song, Brown performed a [[rapping|rap]], advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to "stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight." At the time of the song\'s release, Brown had been participating in performing for troops stationed in Vietnam. A day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]], Brown gave out a televised concert at the [[Boston Garden]] to calm concerned Boston relatives.<ref name=pc51/> The show was later released on DVD as \'\'[[Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968]]\'\'. According to the documentary, \'\'The Night James Brown Saved Boston\'\', then-mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]] had strongly restrained the Boston police from cracking down on minor violence, and protests after the assassination and religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_rock_docs/134183/episode_about.jhtml The Night James Brown Saved Boston.] \'\'VH1 rockDocs\'\'.</ref> White arranged to have Brown\'s performance broadcast multiple times on Boston\'s public television station, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], thus keeping potential rioters off the streets, watching the concert for free.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/> Angered by not being told of this, Brown demanded $60,000 for "gate" fees (money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free) and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards, news of which would have been a political death blow to White and spark riots of its own.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/> White eventually lobbied the behind-the-scenes power-brokering group known as "The Vault" to come up with money for Brown\'s gate fee and other social programs, contributing $100,000. Brown received $15,000 from them via the city. White also persuaded management at the Garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/> Following this successful performance, Brown was cautioned by President Johnson to visit cities ravaged from riots following King\'s assassination to not resort to violence, telling them to "cool it, there\'s another way".{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=54}}

Responding to pressure from black activists, including [[H. Rap Brown]], to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of [[black on black crime]] committed in [[inner city|inner cities]], Brown wrote lyrics to the song, "[[Say It Loud - I\'m Black and I\'m Proud]]", which his bandleader, [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis]] accompanied with a musical composition. Released late that summer, the song\'s lyrics helped to make it an anthem to the civil rights movement. Brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release and later stated he had regrets recording it, saying in 1984, "Now \'Say It Loud \xe2\x80\x93 I\'m Black and I\'m Proud\' has done more for the black race than any other record, but if I had my choice, I wouldn\'t have done it, because I don\'t like defining anyone by race. To teach race is to teach separatism."{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=95}} In his autobiography he stated:

<blockquote>
The song is obsolete now... But it was necessary to teach pride then, and I think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people... People called "Black and Proud" militant and angry \xe2\x80\x93 maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children\'s song. That\'s why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride... The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience. The racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that. I don\'t regret it, though, even if it was misunderstood.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>Brown, James, with Bruce Tucker. \'\'James Brown: The Godfather of Soul\'\' (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company,1986), 200.</ref>

With the release of a movie about his music and life, there has been a strong resurgence of interest in Brown\'s importance to civil rights and the black community. In the summer, 2014, the website Portside posted this commentary on the impact of the song "Now \'Say it Loud - I\'m Black and I\'m Proud"

<blockquote>
"He was a civil rights icon. Put James in the pantheon of the most impactful black men of the 20th century, and he would not be out of place. How can I make such an assertion? One song: "I\'m Black and I\'m Proud."

Before that song, if you wanted to start a fight with a man of color, all one had to do was call him black. Up until the mid-sixties, we were trying define ourselves: not colored anymore, now Negro. But black was not something we called ourselves. And along comes this little man and proudly states, "I\'m black and I\'m proud!" He took the thing that the oppressor used to bludgeon us and made it a weapon of pride for us.

That song caught on like wildfire. One day, our heads were down, the next day, our heads were held high, proud of who we were. We had all these groups, civil rights groups, Muslims, Panthers, but it was JB who gave us our swagger. That song lifted up an entire race! He put us on his back and carried us. Dr. King gave us our rights. JB gave us our dignity. Civil rights icon? You better believe it.

When that song came on the radio, cars stopped in the street. People turned up their radios, came out of their houses, and sang along with it; radio stations put it in a loop and played it for hours. The next day people greeted each other with "Hello, black man!" "My black brother." JB made black beautiful overnight." (Portside.com, 2014)</blockquote>

In 1969, Brown recorded two more songs of social commentary including "[[World (James Brown song)|World]]" and "[[I Don\'t Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing]]", the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and self-reliance rather than entitlement. In 1970, in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough, Brown recorded "[[Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved]]" and "[[Talkin\' Loud and Sayin\' Nothing]]". In 1971, Brown began touring Africa and was made "freeman of the city" in [[Lagos, Nigeria]] by Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, for his "influence on black people all over the world."{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=59}} With his company, James Brown Enterprises, Brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities.{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=60}} As the 1970s continued, Brown continued to record songs of social commentary, much prominently, 1972\'s "[[King Heroin]]" and the two-part ballad "Public Enemy", which dealt with [[drug addiction]].

===Political views===
During the [[1968 presidential campaign]], Brown endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Hubert Humphrey]] and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies. Brown began supporting [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[Richard Nixon]] after being invited to perform at Nixon\'s inaugural ball in January 1969.<ref>{{citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7KNUsxQPRB8C&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=%22james+brown%22+nixon+inaugural+ball&source=bl&ots=7j20QwRyYu&sig=LtHHRU0TFOgGrUG3Vd8nZZ-lLjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y9a3UuHVKtL1oATH9YGIBQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22james%20brown%22%20nixon%20inaugural%20ball&f=false|author=Brown, James, and Tucker, Bruce|title=James Brown: The Godfather of Soul|place=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=1560253886|page=281}}</ref> Brown\'s endorsement of Nixon during the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]] negatively impacted his career during that period with several national Black organizations boycotting his records and protesting at his concert shows.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penman|first=Ian|title=Did He Feel Good?|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2012/bc0608ip.html|work=City Journal|publisher=Manhattan Institute|accessdate=December 22, 2013|date=June 8, 2012}}</ref> Brown stated he was neither Democratic nor Republican despite his support of Republican presidents such as Nixon and [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB5pMBkjaZ4 |title=James Brown on Conviction, Respect and Reagan |work=YouTube |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2014-05-16}}</ref> In 1999, when being interviewed by \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\', the magazine asked him to name a [[hero]] in the 20th century, Brown mentioned [[John F.

==Personal life==
At the end of his life, James Brown lived in a riverfront home in [[Beech Island, South Carolina]], directly across the [[Savannah River]] from [[Augusta, Georgia]]. Brown had [[diabetes]] that went undiagnosed for years, according to his longtime manager Charles Bobbit.{{sfn|Jet|2003|p=54}} In 2004 Brown was successfully treated for [[prostate cancer]].<ref name=jbmed>[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=17912 "Singer James Brown prostate cancer surgery successful".]{{dead link|date=February 2014}} (December 16, 2004). \'\'Medical News Today\'\'. Retrieved January 10, 2007.</ref> Regardless of his health, Brown maintained his reputation as the "hardest working man in show business" by keeping up with his grueling performance schedule.

===Marriages and children===
Brown was married three times. He married his first wife, Velma Warren, in 1953. Over a decade later, the couple had separated, with their divorce finalized by 1969. Despite this, Brown and Warren maintained a close friendship that lasted until Brown\'s death. Brown married his second wife, Deidre "Deedee" Jenkins, on October 22, 1970. The couple were separated by 1979 and their divorce was finalized less than a year later on January 10, 1981. His third and final marriage was to Adrienne Lois Rodriguez (March 9, 1950 \xe2\x80\x93 January 6, 1996). Brown married her in 1984. After a contentious marriage that made headlines due to domestic abuse complaints, Rodriguez died in January 1996. Less than a year after her death, Brown hired [[Tomi Rae Hynie]] to be a background singer for his band. Brown and Hynie began dating shortly afterwards.

On December 23, 2002, Brown and Hynie held a wedding ceremony that was officiated by Rev. Larry Flyer. Following Brown\'s death, controversy surrounded the circumstances of the marriage, with Brown\'s attorney, Albert "Buddy" Dallas, reporting that the marriage wasn\'t valid because Hynie was married to Javed Ahmed, a Bangladeshi whom Hynie claimed married her for a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Card]] in an immigration fraud. Though Hynie contended the marriage was annulled, the annulment didn\'t occur until April 2004.<ref name=jbmarry>Martin, J. (January 4, 2007).

===Drug abuse===
For the majority of his career, Brown had a strict drug and alcohol-free policy for any member in his entourage, including band members, and would fire people who disobeyed orders, particularly those who used or abused drugs and alcohol. Some members of Brown\'s vocal group the Famous Flames were fired due to alcohol use. Despite the policy, some of the original members of Brown\'s 1970s band, [[The J.B.\'s]], including [[Catfish Collins|Catfish]] and [[Bootsy Collins]], intentionally got high on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] during a concert gig in 1971, causing Brown to fire them after the show because he had suspected them to be on drugs all along.<ref>\'\'[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]\'\': Bootsy Collins\'\', [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]], 2011</ref>

However, by the mid-1980s, it was alleged that Brown himself was using drugs. After meeting and later marrying Adrienne Rodriguez, she and Brown began using [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] ("angel dust"). The drug resulted in domestically violent outbursts from Brown and he was arrested several times for [[domestic violence]] against Rodriguez while high on the drug.<ref name=rjsmith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=R.

At one point during the interview, Brown began shouting out his song titles to one of Friedman\'s questions. The interview later went [[viral video|viral]] and led some to assume that Brown was either drunk or on drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmqcaS5LIM |title=1988: Is this James Brown\'s strangest interview ever? |work=CNN (via YouTube) | date=May 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Legal troubles===
Brown\'s personal life was marred by several brushes with the law. At the age of 16, he was convicted of theft and served three years in juvenile prison. On July 16, 1978, after performing at the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]], Brown was arrested for reportedly failing to turn in records from one of his radio stations after the station was forced to file for bankruptcy.<ref name="jbencyclopedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/James_Brown.aspx |title=James Brown Facts, information, pictures Encyclopedia.com articles about James Brown |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2012|p=225}} In May 1988, Brown was arrested for drugs and weapons charges.

For the remainder of his life, Brown was repeatedly arrested for [[domestic violence]]. Adrienne Rodriguez, his third wife, had him arrested four times between 1987 and 1995 on charges of assault. In January 2004, Brown was arrested in South Carolina on a domestic violence charge after Tomi Rae Hynie accused him of pushing her to the floor during an argument at their home, where she suffered scratches and bruises to her right arm and hip. Later that year in June 2004, Brown pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to the domestic violence incident, but served no jail time. Instead, Brown was required to forfeit a US$1,087 bond as punishment.<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/jbrownass1.html James Brown pleads to domestic violence.] (2004). The Smoking Gun. Retrieved January 8, 2007.</ref>

In January 2005, a woman named Jacque Hollander filed a lawsuit against James Brown, which stemmed from an alleged 1988 rape. When the case was initially heard before a judge in 2002, Hollander\'s claims against Brown were dismissed by the court as the limitations period for filing the suit had expired. Hollander claimed that stress from the alleged assault later caused her to contract [[Graves\' Disease]], a thyroid condition. Hollander claimed that the incident took place in South Carolina while she was employed by Brown as a publicist. Hollander alleged that, during her ride in a van with Brown, Brown pulled over to the side of the road and sexually assaulted her while he threatened her with a shotgun. In her case against Brown, Hollander entered as evidence a DNA sample and a polygraph result, but the evidence was not considered due to the limitations defense. Hollander later attempted to bring her case before the Supreme Court but nothing became of her complaint.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6520959.stm |title=James Brown rape case dismissed. |date=April 3, 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref>

\'\'\'Joseph Arrington, Jr.\'\'\' (August 8, 1935<ref name="joetexworld"/>&ndash; August 13, 1982), better known as \'\'\'Joe Tex\'\'\', was an American musician who gained success in the 1960s and 1970s with his brand of [[Southern soul]], which mixed the styles of country, gospel and rhythm and blues.<ref name="joetexworld"/> 

His career started after he was signed to [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in 1955 following four wins at the [[Apollo Theater]]. Between 1955 and 1964, he struggled to find hits and by the time he finally recorded his first hit, "[[Hold What You\'ve Got]]", in 1964, he had recorded thirty prior singles that were deemed failures on the charts.<ref name="joetexworld"/> He went on to have four million-selling hits, "[[Hold What You\'ve Got]]" (1965), "[[Skinny Legs and All (song)|Skinny Legs and All]]" (1967),<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London, UK|page=231|isbn=0-214-20512-6}}</ref> "[[I Gotcha (Joe Tex song)|I Gotcha]]" (1972),<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 3">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London, UK|page=322|isbn=0-214-20512-6}}</ref> and "[[Ain\'t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)]]" (1977).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpopinfo.com/songs/ain-t-gonna-bump-no-more-with-no-big-fat-woman/display|title=Ain\'t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)|publisher=RockPopInfo|accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Joe Tex was born Joseph Arrington, Jr. in [[Rogers, Texas|Rogers, Bell County, Texas]] to Cherie Sue (n\xc3\xa9e Jackson) and Joseph Arrington.<ref name="joetexworld"/> He and his sister Mary Sue were initially raised by their grandmother, Mary Richardson. After Tex\'s parents divorced, their mother moved the siblings to [[Baytown, Texas|Baytown]], [[Texas]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> In high school, Tex played [[baritone saxophone]] in his high school band and also sang for a local [[Pentecostal]] church choir. He entered a number of talent shows and after an important win in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], the 18-year-old won $300 and a trip to [[New York City]].<ref name="joetexworld"/> While in New York, Tex took part in the amateur portion of the [[Apollo Theater]], winning first place four times, leading to his discovery by A&R man [[Henry Glover]], who offered to give him a contract with [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. Due to his mother\'s strong convictions that he should finish high school first, Glover waited a year before Tex signed with the label at the age of 19.<ref name="joetexworld"/>

==Music career==
===Early recordings===
Tex recorded for King Records between 1955 and 1957 with relatively little success. He later claimed he sold musical rights to the composition "[[Fever (Little Willie John song)|Fever]]" to King Records staff, due to failure to pay [[Renting|rent]]. The song\'s credited songwriters, [[Otis Blackwell]] (who used the [[pseudonym]] John Davenport) and Joe Cooley disputed Tex\'s claims.<ref name="joetexworld"/> Labelmate [[Little Willie John]] had a hit with "Fever", later inspiring Tex to write the first of his [[answer song]]s, "Pneumonia".<ref name="joetexworld"/>

In 1958, he signed with [[Ace Records (US)|Ace]] and continued to have relative failures but was starting to build a unique stage reputation while opening up for artists such as [[Jackie Wilson]], [[James Brown]] and [[Little Richard]], perfecting the microphone tricks and dance moves that would define the rest of his career. It has been insisted by many, including Little Richard, that Tex\'s future nemesis James Brown stole Tex\'s dance moves and microphone tricks.<ref name="joetexworld"/> In 1960, he left Ace and briefly recorded for [[Detroit]]\'s [[Anna Records]] label, where he scored a Bubbling Under Billboard hit with his [[cover version]] of [[Etta James]]\' "All I Could Do Was Cry". By then, Tex\'s usage of rapping over his music was starting to become commonplace.<ref name="joetexworld"/>

In 1961, he recorded his composition, "[[Baby You\'re Right]]", for Anna. Later that year, [[James Brown]] recorded a cover version, albeit with different lyrics and a different musical composition, winning songwriting credit, making the song a hit in 1962, reaching #2 on the R&B chart. It was during this time that Tex first began working with [[Buddy Killen]], who formed the [[Dial Records (1964)|Dial Records]] label behind Tex. After a number of songs failed to chart, Killen decided to have [[Atlantic Records]] distribute his recordings with Dial in 1964. By the time he signed with Atlantic, Tex had recorded thirty songs, all of which had failed to make an impact on the charts.<ref name="joetexworld"/>

===Success===
Tex recorded his first hit, "Hold On To What You\'ve Got", in November 1964 at [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]].<ref name="joetexworld"/> He was unconvinced the song would be a hit and advised Killen not to release it.<ref name="joetexworld"/> However, Killen felt otherwise and released the song in early 1965. By the time Tex got wind of its release, the song had already sold 200,000 copies.<ref name="joetexworld"/> The song eventually peaked at #5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and became Tex\'s first number-one hit on the R&B charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling over a million copies by 1966.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Tex would place six top 40 charted singles on the R&B charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits "[[I Want To (Do Everything For You)]]" and "[[A Sweet Woman Like You]]".<ref name="joetexworld"/> He followed that with two successive albums, \'\'Hold On To What You\'ve Got\'\' and \'\'The New Boss\'\'. He placed more R&B hits than any artist, including his nemesis James Brown. In 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the R&B charts including "The Love You Save" and "S.Y.S.L.J.F.M." or "The Letter Song", which was an answer song to [[Wilson Pickett]]\'s "[[634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)]]".<ref name="joetexworld"/>

His 1967 hits included "Show Me", which became an often-covered tune for British rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and his second million-selling hit, "[[Skinny Legs and All (song)|Skinny Legs and All]]".<ref name="joetexworld"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct30.com/kgb/1967/671220.txt|title=KGB, San Diego, California - Survey for week of Wednesday December 20, 1967|publisher=Ct30.com|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> The latter song, released off Tex\'s pseudo live album, \'\'Live and Lively\'\', stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a  [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in January 1968.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 2"/> After leaving Atlantic for Mercury, Tex had several more R&B hits including "Buying a Book" in 1970 and "Give the Baby Anything the Baby Wants" in 1971. The intro saxophone riffs in his 1969 song, "You\'re Right, Ray Charles" later influenced [[Funkadelic]]\'s "Standing on the Verge of Gettin\' It On".<ref name="joetexworld"/>

Tex recorded his next big hit, "[[I Gotcha (Joe Tex song)|I Gotcha]]", in December 1971. The song was released in January 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at #2 on the Hot 100 for two weeks and sold over two million copies becoming his biggest-selling hit to date.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 3"/> Tex was offered a gold disc of the song on March 22, 1972. The parent album reached #17 on the pop albums chart.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs 3"/> Following this and another album, Tex announced his retirement from [[show business]] in September 1972 to pursue life as a minister for [[Islam]].<ref name="joetexworld"/> Tex returned to his music career following the death of [[Elijah Muhammad]] in 1975, releasing the top 40 R&B hit, "Under Your Powerful Love". His last hit, "Ain\'t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)", was released in 1977 and peaked at #12 on the Hot 100 and #2 in the UK.<ref name="joetexworld"/>

His last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the Soul Clan in 1981. After that, Tex withdrew from public life settling at his ranch in [[Navasota, Texas]] and watching football games by his favorite team, the [[Houston Oilers]].<ref name="joetexworld"/>

===Rivalry with James Brown===
The feud between Tex and fellow labelmate [[James Brown]] took its origins allegedly sometime in the mid-1950s when both artists were signed to associated imprints of [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] when Brown allegedly called out on Tex for a "battle" during a dance at a local [[juke joint]]. In 1960, Tex left King and recorded a few songs for [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]-based [[Anna Records]], one of the songs he recorded was the ballad "Baby, You\'re Right". A year later, Brown recorded the song and released it in 1961, changing up the lyrics and the musical [[Musical composition|composition]], earning Brown co-songwriting credits along with Tex. By then, Brown had recruited singer Bea Ford, who had been married to Tex prior but had divorced in 1959. In 1960, Brown and Ford recorded the song, "You\'ve Got the Power". Shortly afterwards, Tex got a personal letter from Brown telling him that he was through with Ford and if Tex wanted her back, he could have her. Tex responded by recording the [[diss record]], "You Keep Her", where he called Brown\'s name out.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

In 1963, their feud escalated when Brown and Tex performed at what was Brown\'s homecoming concert at [[Macon, Georgia]]. Tex, who opened the show, arrived in a tattered cape and began rolling around on the floor as if in agony, and screamed, "please - somebody help get me out of this cape!" This allegedly resulted in Brown finding Tex at an after show party at a [[nightclub]] and shooting at the place with his gun.<ref>{{cite web|title=Worst Band Feuds: No. 3|date=September 14, 2007|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/09/14/worst-band-feuds-no-3/|publisher=Spinner}}</ref> Tex would later claim that Brown stole his dance moves and his microphone stand tricks. In a few interviews he gave in the sixties, Tex dismissed the notion of Brown being called "Soul Brother No. 1" insisting that [[Little Willie John]] was the original "Soul Brother No. 1".<ref name="joetexworld" /> Tex even claimed Brown stopped radio disk jockeys from not playing his hit, "[[Skinny Legs and All (song)|Skinny Legs and All]]", which Tex claimed prevented Tex from taking down one of Brown\'s number-one songs at the time.<ref name="joetexworld" /> During a 1968 tour, Tex had the words, "The New Soul Brother No. 1", on his bus, leading to people heckling him. Tex immediately took the name off of the bus and had it repainted.<ref name="joetexworld" /> Tex even offered to challenge Brown to contest who was "the real soul brother". Brown reportedly refused the challenge stating at the time to the [[Afro-American (newspaper)|Afro-American]] newspaper, "I will not fight a black man. You need too much help."<ref name="joetexworld" />

While Tex moved on from his initial feud with Brown, Brown reportedly joked, "who?" in his [[Bobby Byrd]] and [[Hank Ballard]] duet, "Funky Side of Town", from his \'\'[[Get on the Good Foot]]\'\' album, when Ballard mentioned Tex\'s name as one of the stars of soul music.

==Personal life and death==
A convert to Islam in 1966, he changed his name to Yusuf Hazziez, and toured as a spiritual lecturer. He had one daughter, Eartha Doucet, and four sons, Joseph Arrington III, Ramadan Hazziez, Jwaade Hazziez and Joseph Hazziez.

==Death==
On August 13, 1982, Yusuf Hazziez died at his home in [[Navasota, Texas]], following a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], five days after his 47th birthday.

==Cover versions==
Several other artists have [[cover version|covered]] Tex\'s work. Tom Johnston of the [[Doobie Brothers]] covered "Show Me" on his 1979 solo album, \'\'Everything You Heard Is True\'\', [[The Monkees]] sang it in concert(lead sung by Dolenz) from March to November 1969, and, in 1971, [[Barbara Mandrell]] had a country hit with it as well.  Including the rock band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]\'s "[[I Want To (Do Everything for You)]]" and [[Phish]] who performed "You Better Believe It Baby" on July 26, 1998 at the [[Starplex Amphitheater]] in [[Dallas]], Texas and again on August 2, 1998 at [[Deer Creek Music Center]] in Noblesville, Indiana.  Both the rock band [[The Trews]] and \'\'[[Lawrence "Lipbone" Redding]] covered "The Love You Save (May Be Your Own)"; The Trews on their acoustic album, \'\'[[Acoustic - Friends & Total Strangers]]in 2009 and Redding on his 2011 album, \'\'Unbroken\'\'. Johnny Cash covered Tex\'s "Look at Them Beans" in 1975. The UK band [[Q-Tips (band)|Q-Tips]] performed "S.Y.S.L.J.F.M.(The Letter Song)" regularly in their live shows.

\'\'\'Kleeer\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[New York City|New York]]-based [[funk]], [[disco]] and [[post-disco]] [[band (music)|band]], which was formed in 1972 under the name \'\'\'The Jam Band\'\'\', as a backup group to different disco bands and [[singer|vocalists]].

==Members==
* Woodrow "Woody" Cunningham ([[lead singer|lead vocalist]] and [[drummer]])
* Paul Crutchfield ([[percussionist]] and [[keyboardist]])
* Richard Lee ([[guitarist]]) 
* Norman Durham ([[bassist]])

==Career==
After a switch to the name \'\'\'Pipeline\'\'\' in 1975, the group also decided to switch to making [[hard rock]] instead of disco. [[Record label]]s competed to sign them but, when they finally ended up at [[Columbia Records]], their [[single (music)|single]] "Gypsie Rider" did not fare well commercially.

In 1976 they got the opportunity to become [[The Universal Robot Band]] along with underground disco producers [[Patrick Adams (musician)|Patrick Adams]] and [[Greg Carmichael]]. This project was more successful than their former projects. They made the single "[[Barely Breaking Even]]" alongside singer [[Leroy Burgess]], and they also recorded an [[album]]. The group toured as The Universal Robot Band until 1978.
After 1978, the band decided to make all their music themselves under the new name of \'\'\'Kleeer\'\'\'.

Between 1979 and 1985 the group released seven albums and had several [[hit record|hits]] in the [[United States|US]] [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and in [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|charts]]. The most mentionable are "Keep Your Body Workin\'", "Tonight\'s the Night", "Winners", "Intimate Connection", and "Get Tough".  The sound was now more focused on 1980s style funk, and [[electronic instruments]], like [[vocoder]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

[[The System (band)|The System]] lead singer [[Mic Murphy]] was a road manager for the band before the start of his record career.<ref>[http://www.jacquespetrus.com/murphy.htm Interview with Mic Murphy]</ref>

After the 1985\'s album \'\'Seeekret\'\', the band disappeared for unknown reasons. Most of the musicians continued working with other projects. In the 1990s, however, the group re-formed as Kleeer at some occasions.

==Influence==
The group\'s influence today is best found in many [[hip hop music|hip hop]] songs, where [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s have frequently [[sampling (music)|sampled]] Kleeer, for example by [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[DJ Quik]], [[Lil Jon]] and [[The Eastside Boys]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} "Keeep Your Body Workin", which reached number 54 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] Chart in 1979, was "reworked" into an updated recording by [[Tony Moran]] featuring [[Martha Wash]], under the title "[[Keep Your Body Working]]." The Moran/Wash version reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart in December 2007.

==Deaths==
Woody Cunningham died on January 9, 2010 at age 61.

Norman Durham died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his sleep at home in [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] on November 2, 2011 at age 59.<ref>[http://archive.lohud.com/article/20111103/NEWS03/111030408/Chestnut-Ridge-man-likely-died-from-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-sleep "Chestnut Ridge man likely died from carbon monoxide poisoning in sleep"] [[The Journal News]], November 3, 2011</ref>

[[File:Kool and the Gang.jpg|thumb|right|upright 2|Kool and the Gang]]

\'\'\'Kool & the Gang\'\'\' are an American [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] group, originally formed in 1964 as the Jazziacs based in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004800/Kool-amp-the-Gang.html |title=Kool & the Gang Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

They went through several musical phases during the course of their recording career, starting out with a purist jazz sound, then becoming practitioners of funk and R&B, progressing to a smooth pop-funk ensemble, and in the post-millennium creating music with a modern, electro-pop sound.

They have sold over 70 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/kool_and_the_gang/artist.jhtml |title=Kool & the Gang &#124; Free Music Videos, News, Photos, Interviews, Lyrics, Tour Dates, Ringtones |publisher=VH1 |date=1998-10-08 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

The group\'s main members over the years included brothers [[Robert "Kool" Bell|Robert Bell (Muhammad Bayyan)]] on bass and [[Ronald Bell (musician)|Ronald Bell (Khalis Bayyan)]] on [[tenor saxophone]], lead vocalist [[James "J.T." Taylor]], George Brown on drums, Larry Gittens on trumpet, Dennis Thomas on [[alto saxophone]],  [[Claydes Charles Smith]] on guitar, Mark Blakey on triangle and Rick West (Westfield) on keyboards. The Bell brothers\' father Bobby and uncle Tommy were boxers. They moved to New York to train and lived in the same apartment building as [[Thelonious Monk]] who became Robert\'s godfather when he was born. Miles Davis would drop by because he wanted to be a boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/news-and-views/local-history/Interview-Robert-Kool-Bell-of-Kool--The-Gang-143662756.html l |title=Interview: Robert Kool Bell of Kool & The Gang |publisher=Atlantic City Weekly |date=2012-03-21|accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref> They played occasionally with McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders and  [[Leon Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amentertainment.com/artist-booking/kool-and-the-gang l |title=Kool & The Gang - Booking A&M Entertainment |publisher=A&M Entertainment|accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>

==Formation and early success==
In 1964, thirteen-year-old Robert Bell, his brother Ronald and five high-school friends formed an instrumental band called the Jazziacs. They played an opening set every Sunday at jazz night at a small theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://njmonthly.com/articles/lifestyle/NJM-Q-and-A/and-the-gang-plays-on-kool-and-the-gang.html |title=And the Gang Plays On |publisher=New Jersey Monthly Magazine |date=2014-06-12|accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref> They changed their name to "Kool & the Flames" in 1967, then "Kool & the Gang" in 1969 (to avoid confusion with [[James Brown]]\'s [[Famous Flames]]) and were signed by Gene Redd to his new record label [[De-Lite Records]] in 1969.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolthegang/biography] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}.</ref>

==International success==
The band first hit the R&B charts with the release of their debut [[Kool and the Gang (album)|eponymous album]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Several live and studio albums followed, with 1973\'s \'\'[[Wild and Peaceful (Kool & the Gang album)|Wild and Peaceful]]\'\' breaking into the mainstream with "Funky Stuff", "[[Jungle Boogie]]" and "[[Hollywood Swinging]]". Many reviews see the Gang\'s 1974 album \'\'[[Light of Worlds]]\'\' and 1975 album \'\'[[Spirit of the Boogie]]\'\' as the greatest achievements of the band, with the 1975 single "Summer Madness" gaining much attention. However, after the release of those albums the band abandoned deep funk music and switched to pop-funk and disco. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The late 1970s saw a lull in Kool & the Gang\'s output except for the album \'\'[[Open Sesame (Kool & the Gang album)|Open Sesame]]\'\', which yielded the title track "Open Sesame", achieving some success as part of the [[Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track|Saturday Night Fever soundtrack]]. New lead singer [[James "J.T." Taylor]] then joined the group, starting with 1979\'s \'\'[[Ladies\' Night (album)|Ladies\' Night]]\'\'. Their number one hit in 1980\'s "[[Celebration (Kool & the Gang song)|Celebration]]" was from \'\'[[Celebrate!]]\'\', co-produced by [[Eumir Deodato]]. More international hits followed in the early 1980s, including "Big Fun", "[[Get Down on It]]", and "[[Joanna (Kool & the Gang song)|Joanna]]".  Their 1984 album \'\'[[Emergency (Kool & the Gang album)|Emergency]]\'\' yielded four top-20 pop hits, including "Fresh" and "[[Cherish (Kool & the Gang song)|Cherish]]".  Their chart presence stopped after \'\'[[Forever (Kool and the Gang album)|Forever]]\'\'. In 1988, Taylor left the group amicably to pursue a solo career. He returned for the 1996 album \'\'[[State of Affairs (Kool & the Gang album)|State of Affairs]]\'\', which did not make much of an impact commercially. Taylor departed again in 2001 to resume his solo career.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Kool & the Gang today==
Of Kool & the Gang\'s original members, the Bell brothers, Brown, and Thomas are still with the group. Rick West, the group\'s original keyboardist, left in 1976 to form his own band, and died in 1985. Guitarist Claydes Smith died after a long illness on June 20, 2006, aged 57 and was replaced by the Bells\' youngest brother [[Amir Bayyan]], former leader of [[the Kay-Gees]]. Original trumpet player Robert "Spike" Mickens, who had retired in 1986 due to poor health, died at the age of 59 on November 2, 2010, at a nursing home in Far Rockaway, New York. Kool and the Gang soon added [[Larry Gittens]] in 1975, from the Stylistics, along with Spike Mickens. Longtime members who continue to perform and record with the group include Curtis Williams (keyboards) and additional trumpeter Michael Ray.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

"Jungle Boogie" was featured on the soundtrack of [[Quentin Tarantino]]\'s \'\'[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]\'\' and on the movie soundtrack of "[[Undercover Brother]]" along with the song "Ladies Night". The band released the album \'\'Still Kool\'\' in 2007. "Hollywood Swinging" was sampled by [[DJ Kool]] in his song "[[Let Me Clear My Throat]]," and by rappers [[Mase]] on "Feel So Good" and [[Too Short]] on "Money In The Ghetto".

Kool & the Gang\'s "Summer Madness" from their 1974 album \'\'Light of Worlds\'\' has been sampled numerous times. It was used by [[DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince]] for their 1991 single "Summertime". "Summer Madness" was also featured in the 1976 Picture of the Year, "[[Rocky]]". A live version of the track recorded at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London was released in 1976 on the \'\'[[Love & Understanding]]\'\' album (De-Lite DEP 2018). \'\'[[Live at PJ\'s]]\'\' track "N.T" has been sampled extensively by artists such as [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Brand Nubian (hip hop group)|Brand Nubian]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Nas]], [[N.W.A]] and [[Kris Kross]]. The song was also sampled by [[Jermaine Dupri]] featuring [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]] on the song, "[[We Just Wanna Party with You]]" from the soundtrack to the film in 1997, \'\'[[Men in Black: The Album]]\'\' starring [[Will Smith]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]].

In 2013, they released their first [[Christmas album]], \'\'Kool for the Holidays\'\'.

\'\'\'Labelle\'\'\' is an American all female singing group who were a popular vocal group of the 1960s and 1970s. The group was formed after the disbanding of two rival girl groups in the [[Philadelphia]]/[[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] areas, the Ordettes and the Del-Capris, forming as a new version of the former group, later changing their name to \'\'\'The Blue Belles\'\'\' (later \'\'\'Bluebelles\'\'\'). The founding members were [[Patti LaBelle]] (formerly Patricia Holt), [[Sundray Tucker]], [[Nona Hendryx]] and [[Sarah Dash]]. Tucker left before the group cut their first record and was replaced by [[Cindy Birdsong]].

As The Bluebelles, and later \'\'\'Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles\'\'\', the group found success with ballads in the [[doo-wop]] genre, most notably, "[[Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)]]", "[[You\'ll Never Walk Alone]]" and "[[Over the Rainbow]]". After Birdsong departed from the group to join [[The Supremes]] in 1967, under the advice of [[Vicki Wickham]], the group changed its look, musical direction and style and reformed as \'\'\'Labelle\'\'\', in 1971. Their [[funk rock]] recordings of that period were cult favorites and they were raved for their brash interpretation of rock and roll and for dealing with subject matter that was not touched by black groups. Finally after adapting [[glam rock]] and wearing outlandish space-age and glam rock-adorned costumes, the group found success with the proto-disco smash, "[[Lady Marmalade]]", in 1974, leading to their parent album, \'\'[[Nightbirds]]\'\', becoming a platinum success. They are notable for being the first contemporary pop group and first black pop group to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]].

The group went on their own after the end of a tour in 1976 going on to have significant amount of solo success, especially Nona Hendryx, who followed an idiosyncratic muse into her own solo career, which often bordered on the avant-garde<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/labelle/bio.jhtml Labelle | View the Music Artists Biography Online | VH1.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and Patti LaBelle, who\'s enjoyed a very successful [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning solo career.

The group returned with their first new album in 32 years with 2008\'s \'\'[[Back to Now]]\'\'.

==History==

===Sweethearts of The Apollo===
In 1958, Patricia "Patsy" Holt formed her first singing group, the Ordettes in her [[Philadelphia]] hometown, after being influenced by [[The Chantels]] and [[The Shirelles]] and solo female performers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Clara Ward]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. Around 1959, Holt and fellow Ordette member Sundray Tucker met and befriended a rival girl group from [[Trenton, New Jersey]], not too far from Philadelphia, named the Del-Capris, which featured friends Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash. Shortly afterwards, both groups disbanded and the Ordettes\' then-manager Bernard Montague insisted Holt and Tucker join forces with Hendryx and Dash. The girls, loving the camaraderie between them, reformed the Ordettes. In 1960, due to failing grades, Tucker was forced to drop out of the group. Needing a replacement, Holt contacted a longtime neighborhood friend, [[Cindy Birdsong]], who had moved back to Philadelphia from [[Camden, New Jersey]] where she was attending college to study a life as a nurse. However, after Holt contacted her of the Ordettes needing a new member to replace Sundray Tucker, Birdsong immediately decided to drop out of college and join the group. At 20 years old, she was the eldest member of the group (Holt was 16, Hendryx was 15 and Dash was only 14).

After performing in several talent shows for a year, the group found a record label with the local Newtown Records. Before signing the group, the label\'s president, Harold Robinson, was unimpressed with the physical looks of Holt, telling staff he felt Holt was "too dark and too unattractive" to be the lead singer. When Holt sung during the group\'s audition, however, the president changed his mind, and soon signed the group. Shortly afterwards, Robinson advised the group to change its name to one of Newtown\'s subsidiaries, Blue Belle Records. As The Blue Belles, their first single was ironically a song that the group didn\'t participate in - "[[I Sold My Heart to the Junkman]]" was, as explained in Patti LaBelle\'s memoirs, \'\'Don\'t Block the Blessings\'\', originally recorded by [[The Starlets]], then riding high on their hit single, "Tell Him No" and were on the road when the song was released, unable to promote it. Robinson credited the song to the Blue Belles, who later were sent to promote the song, which peaked at the top twenty of the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]], in 1962. Following a potential lawsuit from a president of another record label for using the name \'\'\'Blue Belles\'\'\', Robinson gave Holt the stage name, \'\'\'Patti La Belle\'\'\' (La Belle means [[French language|French]] for "the beautiful one"), and altered the group\'s name to \'\'\'Patti La Belle and Her Blue Belles\'\'\'. In 1963, the group recorded two albums for Newtown, a Christmas album titled \'\'Sleigh Bells, Jingle Bells and Blue Bells\'\', and a faux-live album (compiled from their studio recordings with an added audience track), \'\'Sweethearts of the Apollo\'\', taking from a title giving to them after the group successfully performed at the [[Apollo Theater]], however the group failed to match their live success with any following records and left Newtown for more established [[Cameo-Parkway Records]], releasing the top 40 hit, "[[Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)]]".

The group performed constantly with [[Murray the K]] and also performed on the famous chitlin\' circuit. The group, which consisted of sweet, soulful harmonies, and gospel backgrounds, set themselves differently from more pop-oriented girl groups such as [[The Ronettes]], [[The Marvelettes]] and [[The Supremes]], gaining an audience. In 1964, the group had another top 40 hit with their version of "[[You\'ll Never Walk Alone]]", later reappearing on \'\'American Bandstand\'\' singing the song. After releasing their third album, another live performance at the Apollo, the group looked to find fame after [[Atlantic Records]] president [[Ahmet Ertegun]] offered the group a deal.

===Move to Atlantic and Cindy Birdsong\'s departure===
In 1965, Atlantic Records signed the Bluebelles to a contract, again altering their name to simply \'\'\'Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles\'\'\'. Following a year in the studio, the band released their first [[studio album]], \'\'Over the Rainbow\'\', which was modestly successful and included the modest pop hit, "All or Nothing" and the soon-to-be R&B standard, "[[Over the Rainbow]]". The latter hit won them more fans as they began touring outside the United States, first opening for [[The Rolling Stones]]. Due to their UK exposure, the group toured constantly in the region, appearing on an episode of \'\'[[Ready Steady Go!]]\'\', produced by their future manager Vicki Wickham, and also touring with [[Elton John|Reginald Dwight]]\'s band, Bluesology, backing them up. Around this same time, the group began to work behind the scenes as session singers, filling in backgrounds for the likes of artists such as [[Wilson Pickett]]. They were famously featured singing background on Pickett\'s 1966 hit, "[[634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)]]".

The group seemed destined for stardom after the release of their second album, \'\'Dreamer\'\', which featured the soulful title track, the hit "Take Me For a Little While" and their cover of [[The Impressions]]\' "I\'m Still Waiting", which each gave them moderate chart success. However, promotion of the album and its singles stopped abruptly when Cindy Birdsong, who had spent months as a stand-in for [[The Supremes|Supremes]] founder [[Florence Ballard]], suddenly left the Bluebelles to become a full-fledged member of The Supremes. Following Birdsong\'s departure, [[Sundray Tucker]] briefly filled in Cindy\'s place while touring. The group fell out of sync as grittier soul artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and psychedelic rock artists such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] emerged, making the [[girl group]] sound out of date with the public. The group struggled with recordings and were forced to take whatever performance offers they were given. In 1970, the Bluebelles were dropped from their Atlantic contract. Their longtime manager, Bernard Montague, would also leave them that year to focus his full-time on fellow Philly group, [[The Delfonics]]. After almost signing with [[Frankie Crocker]] and Herb Hamlett as their managers, the group settled on Vicki Wickham, after [[Dusty Springfield]], who was also managed by Wickham and was a fan of the Bluebelles insisted Wickham worked with them.

===Reinvention===
Wickham advised the group to move to London and change their entire image and sound,<ref>[http://www.baywindows.com/index.php?ch=arts&sc=music&sc2=news&sc3=&id=82622 "Belles of the Ball"], Dustin Fitzharris, \'\'Bay Windows\'\', Oct 29, 2008</ref> something Patti LaBelle later admitted she felt uncomfortable with. LaBelle had fears when the group returned to America with their new laid-back image that they would be booed and heckled for betraying fans with a new sound and look. Wickham advised them to change their name to simply \'\'\'Labelle\'\'\' and adapt a [[rock music|rock]] sound while keeping the group\'s R&B roots intact. After a year in London, the group returned to the United States and signed with the Track Records imprint and a distribution deal with Atlantic\'s sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]], later being sent out on the road as the opening act to [[The Who]]. The group\'s producer [[Kit Lambert]] signed on to produce [[Labelle (album)|Labelle\'s debut album]] on Warner Bros. Records, which came out in 1971. The album was notable for their inspired soulful covers of [[The Rolling Stones]]\' "[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]" and [[Laura Nyro]]\'s "Time and Love". It was also notable for the first known compositions by member Nona Hendryx, who co-wrote with LaBelle, the socially conscious "Shades of Difference". The album\'s first single, the sexually charged, "Morning Much Better" was co-written by future disco hit-maker [[Michael Zager]].

In the same year \'\'Labelle\'\' was produced, [[Gamble and Huff|Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff]] hired the group to partake in backing up Laura Nyro on her acclaimed covers album, \'\'[[Gonna Take a Miracle]]\'\'. Nyro and LaBelle later became best friends and Nyro became a godmother of LaBelle\'s son Zuri in 1973. Nyro and the group later toured together continuing into 1974. That same year, they vocally contributed to [[Nikki Giovanni]]\'s \'\'Peace Be Still\'\'. During the Nyro recordings, Gamble & Huff had approached the group to record a song about a marriage breaking up after ten years titled "[[If You Don\'t Know Me By Now]]". It\'s unknown if Labelle themselves recorded it but due to conflicting recording and touring schedules, the song was never put on Labelle\'s follow-up Warner Bros. album, \'\'[[Moon Shadow (Labelle album)|Moon Shadow]]\'\' and [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]] recorded the song making it a hit. In 1972, the group\'s second album, \'\'Moon Shadow\'\', came out, notably featuring more compositions from Nona Hendryx. Though Patti LaBelle and Sarah Dash had some parts in writing some songs for the group, Hendryx would emerge at the end of 1972 as the dominant songwriter of the three. \'\'Moon Shadow\'\' again featured Labelle doing gospel-influenced renditions of rock and roll numbers including the title track (originally by [[Cat Stevens]]) and The Who\'s "[[Won\'t Get Fooled Again]]" and another sexually intense Hendryx composition, "Touch Me All Over". The group debuted their then-[[Afrocentric]] look on the show, \'\'Soul\'\', in 1972. The group received critical acclaim for these works but neither attracted commercial attention. Following the release of \'\'Moon Shadow\'\' and its relative failure, Warner Bros. dropped them from their contract. In 1973, the group accepted a one-off deal with [[RCA Records]] to produce their next record, the transitional \'\'[[Pressure Cookin\']]\'\' album, released shortly after LaBelle gave birth to her son.

It was during promotion of the album that Wickham once again advised the group to change their look. Inspired by the emerging [[glam rock]] sounds and styles of [[Marc Bolan]] and [[David Bowie]], the group adapted a more flamboyant image. The album itself had glam rock influences and was notable for the group\'s impassioned, shocking take of "Something in the Air" which segued into [[Gil Scott Heron]]\'s acclaimed "[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]". Despite their new image and Hendryx\'s growth as a songwriter (the song "Hollywood", or "(Can I Speak to You Before You Go To) Hollywood", allegedly dedicated to [[Cindy Birdsong]], was a notable highlight in their career) and the presence of [[Stevie Wonder]] on the single, "Open Your Heart", \'\'Pressure Cookin\'\'\' again failed to attract a commercial audience. Despite this, a cult following began to develop and following the group opening for The Rolling Stones on their U.S. tour, the group switched labels, going to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] in 1974, signing with the subsidiary [[Epic Records|Epic]].

===Success===
After [[Allen Toussaint]] offered to produce the group\'s next album, Labelle spent two weeks in [[New Orleans]] working on what became \'\'[[Nightbirds]]\'\'. More inspired by [[Elton John]], who they would be reacquainted with since Elton\'s band Bluesology had originally backed the former Bluebelles, and Bowie, the group wore more wilder outfits with each member adapting their own flamboyant style to their distinctive looks. They debuted this new image while opening for The Stones. After \'\'Nightbirds\'\' was released in September 1974, the group went on a U.S. tour. That October, the group made history by performing at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003882/Patti-LaBelle.html |title=Musician Guide Biography: Patti LaBelle |accessdate=2009-09-02}}</ref> in a concert later billed as "Wear Something Silver", as the members of Labelle were now wearing silver, metallic wear equipped with feathers and silver platform boots, which later inspired [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] to adapt a similar look for his band, [[Funkadelic]], two years later, also adapting the space-age lyrical and musical matter, pioneered by Nona Hendryx and Labelle. The success of the concert gave them rave reviews and soon radio airplay increased with the album\'s leading single, "[[Lady Marmalade]]", released two months before the performance at the Met.

Famed for its come-hither chorus (\'\'"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"\'\', French for "Do you wanna sleep with me, tonight?"), "Lady Marmalade" became an instant success and by March 1975 had become the number-one hit in the country and also was an international hit. The success sent \'\'Nightbirds\'\' to the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] album chart, eventually selling a million copies. "Lady Marmalade" was also a million-seller, the group\'s first-ever, making the group, after a sixteen-year tenure, overnight successes. They had modest chart success with the dance single, "What Can I Do For You". Both songs became important in the development of [[disco]] and also pushed [[funk]] to the mainstream. Following this success, Labelle made history again as they became the first predominantly black group to be featured on the cover of \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\'. Labelle embarked on an international tour as headliners. After returning to the states, the group later reassembled in New Orleans to record their follow-up to \'\'Nightbirds\'\'. The follow-up, \'\'[[Phoenix (Labelle album)|Phoenix]]\'\', featured the singles "Messin\' With My Mind" and "Far As We Felt Like Goin\'". While it charted at a respectable number 44 on the pop chart and was again a critical success, it failed to repeat the success of \'\'Nightbirds\'\' and the group never again had a hit as huge as "Lady Marmalade". In 1976, the group worked with David Rubinson on their next album, \'\'[[Chameleon (Labelle album)|Chameleon]]\'\', which featured the hits "Get You Somebody New" and "Isn\'t It a Shame", the latter song Patti LaBelle mentions as the last song the group ever recorded together.

===Decline and breakup===
Despite trying to keep an image of unity and sisterhood that had often been the message of Labelle, tensions between the bandmates grew. By the time the group began recording their next album, \'\'Shaman\'\', they could no longer agree on a musical sound. LaBelle - who was never fond of their glam rock look - longed to return to the ballads she had enjoyed singing while the group was the Bluebelles. Hendryx, who was in favor of the glam rock image and style, wanted to record more music of that caliber but often found herself in conflict with the label and even her own bandmates. Dash wanted the group to record more disco, a genre neither LaBelle nor Hendryx took favorably, despite the fact that "Lady Marmalade" helped to pioneer that particular genre.

During a show in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] in 1976, Hendryx wandered off the stage and into the audience at the beginning of "(Can I Speak To You Before You Go To) Hollywood". Labelle\'s stage manager was able to steer Hendryx backstage, but Hendryx locked herself in her dressing room and beat her head against the wall until it began to bleed severely. She was removed from the theater in restraints.<ref>LaBelle, Patti; Lancaster, Laura Randolph. Don\'t Block the Blessings: Revelations of a Lifetime (Kindle Location 2529). New York : Riverhead Books. Kindle Edition.</ref>

Feeling the group had reached the end of its rope, LaBelle advised Hendryx and Dash to disband the group, ending it as long as their friendship remained intact. Eventually the group agreed to go their separate ways, announcing their split in early 1977, repairing their friendship. All three members, shortly afterwards, embarked on solo careers.

===Solo careers and reunions===
Of the three members to embark on solo careers, lead singer Patti LaBelle was the most successful, crossing over to [[pop music|pop]] in the 1980s with hits such as "[[New Attitude (song)|New Attitude]]" and "[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]". LaBelle would later win two Grammys and would receive a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Sarah Dash found more success as a side-woman collaborating with the likes of [[Keith Richards]] and released several dance recordings that found modest success. The experimental Nona Hendryx recorded [[hard rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[house (music)|house]] and [[new age]], finding her biggest chart success with the dance-pop single, "Why Should I Cry?"

All three members collaborated on each other\'s projects over the years following their 1977 split. LaBelle appeared in a couple of albums by Hendryx and Dash attributing background vocals and, in the case of Dash, a duet. In 1991, 15 years after their last recordings together, the group reunited on Patti LaBelle\'s \'\'[[Burnin\' (Patti LaBelle album)|Burnin\']]\'\', recording the funky "Release Yourself", another Hendryx composition. Hendryx and LaBelle co-wrote the latter\'s hit, "[[When You\'ve Been Blessed (Feels Like Heaven)]]" on the same album. The group performed their reunion song at [[The Apollo Theater]] during a televised special there to help LaBelle promote \'\'Burnin\'\'\'.

Lebelle reunited again in 1995 to record the dance hit, "[[Turn it Out]]", for the soundtrack to the film, \'\'[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]].\'\' The song became their first charted hit in nineteen years peaking at number-one on the Billboard dance singles chart. Labelle would announce a full-fledged reunion in 2005 after the group recorded the [[Rosa Parks]] tribute song, "Dear Rosa", featured on LaBelle\'s TV show, \'\'Living It Up with Patti LaBelle\'\', and after recording, with gospel artist [[Tye Tribbett]], the gospel song, "Preaching to the Choir", from the movie of the same name, which LaBelle starred in. The group would sign a recording deal with [[Verve Records]] in 2007 and recorded their new album, \'\'[[Back to Now]]\'\', throughout late 2007 and 2008, releasing the album that October.

That year, the trio went back on tour together which carried through the spring of 2009.<ref>[http://washblade.com/2008/10-31/arts/music/13508.cfm Labelle ladies reunite - The Washington Blade]</ref> In an interview with the \'\'[[Toronto Star]]\'\',<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/520899 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=LaBelle gets back to now with release of new disc | first=Elio | last=Iannacci | date=October 21, 2008 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref> Patti LaBelle explained why she, Dash and Hendryx waited over 32 years to record a full-length album: "You don\'t want to half-step something this important....it was about finding the right time and place. We were never ones to do anything on anyone else\'s time anyway; we were always unconventional. I still have my glitter boots to prove it."

The group performed a triumphant show at the Apollo Theatre in New York City on December 19, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|author=Als, Hilton|title=Three Sisters|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/notebook/2008/12/22/081222gonb_GOAT_notebook_als|date=December 22, 2008|work=The New Yorker|publisher=Cond\xc3\xa9Net|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Pareles, Jon|title=Lady of the Power Voice Reunited With Her Sisters|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/arts/music/22labe.html|date=December 21, 2008|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref>

==Legacy and influence==
Years after their departure in 1976, Labelle\'s influence has been reflected by groups such as [[En Vogue]], [[Destiny\'s Child]] and [[The Pussycat Dolls]], who recorded the Labelle hit, "Far As We Felt Like Goin\'" from the \'\'Phoenix\'\' album. Their biggest hit, "Lady Marmalade" continues to be covered, with its successful covers being renditions by [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]] and the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning number-one hit collaboration between singers [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[M\xc3\xbda]] and rapper [[Lil\' Kim]] in 2001 (recorded for the \'\'[[Moulin Rouge!]]\'\' soundtrack.) The song was also covered by Madchester-era indie group The Happy Mondays, who spliced it with "Kinky Afro",  . The group\'s 1960s hit, "You\'ll Never Walk Alone", was covered by [[Sam Harris (entertainer)|Sam Harris]] (who also covered their rendition of "Over The Rainbow"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWkzeTOOxbo |title=You\'Ll Never Walk Alone And Take My Hand, Precious Lord Sung By Sam Harris |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoHDT89FwSA |title=Sam Harris-Somewhere Over The Rainbow |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> and sampled by [[Kanye West]] in an early version of his song, "Homecoming" (which sampled the group\'s "walk on" intro) while their 1970s hit, "Isn\'t It a Shame" was sampled by [[Nelly]] on his song, "[[My Place]]". Their 1973 song, "Goin\' On a Holiday", was also sampled in several hip-hop songs (sampling the group\'s vocal bridge, "goin\', goin\', goin\', goin\'...on...").

The group has been called pioneers of the [[disco]] movement for the proto-disco singles "[[Lady Marmalade]]" and "Messin\' With My Mind". In turn, "Lady Marmalade" has been also called one of the first mainstream disco hits (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). In 2003, "Lady Marmalade" was inducted to the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].

In 2009, their songs "It Took a Long Time" and "System" were featured in [[Lee Daniels]]\' film \'\'[[Precious (film)|Precious]]\'\'.

\'\'\'Leslie Coleman "Les" McCann\'\'\' (born September 23, 1935, in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[soul jazz]] pianist and vocalist<ref name="LF">Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira (2007) \'\'The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz\'\', p448. Oxford University Press.</ref> whose biggest successes came as a crossover artist into R&B and soul.

==Biography==

An early musical success for McCann was his winning of a Navy talent contest for singing; this led to an appearance on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].<ref name="LF" /> McCann\'s main career began in the early 1960s when he recorded as a pianist with his trio for [[Pacific Jazz Records]].<ref name="am">{{cite web|title =Les McCann: Biography |first=Scott|last=Yanow |publisher=Allmusic| url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=les-mccann-p7081/biography|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate =2010-10-17}}</ref>

In 1969, Atlantic Records released \'\'[[Swiss Movement]]\'\', a recording of McCann with frequent collaborator, saxophonist [[Eddie Harris]], and guest trumpeter [[Benny Bailey]] at that year\'s [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title =Swiss Movement: Review |first=Brian|last=Olewnick |publisher=Allmusic| url ={{Allmusic|class=album|id=swiss-movement-r143666/review|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate =2010-10-17}}</ref> The album contained the song "[[Compared to What]]", and both the album and the single were huge \'\'Billboard\'\' pop chart successes. "Compared to What" featured political criticism of the [[Vietnam War]]. The song was not written by McCann; fellow Atlantic composer/artist [[Eugene McDaniels]] wrote it years earlier. "Compared to What"  was initially recorded and released by soul vocalist [[Roberta Flack]]. Her version appeared as the opening track on her debut recording, \'\'[[First Take (album)|First Take]]\'\' (1969).

After the success of \'\'Swiss Movement\'\', McCann &mdash; primarily a piano player &mdash; began to emphasize his rough-hewn vocals more. He became an innovator in the [[soul jazz]] style, merging jazz with funk, soul and world rhythms; much of his early 1970s music prefigures the [[Stevie Wonder]] albums of that decade. He was among the first jazz musicians to include electric piano, clavinet, and synthesizer in his music.

In 1971, he and Harris were part of a group of soul, R&B, and rock performers &mdash; including [[Wilson Pickett]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] and [[Ike & Tina Turner]] &mdash; who flew to [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] for a historic 14-hour concert before more than 100,000 Ghanaians. The March 6 concert was recorded for the documentary film \'\'[[Soul To Soul (film)|Soul To Soul]]\'\'. In 2004 the movie was released on DVD with an accompanying soundtrack album.

Les McCann discovered [[Roberta Flack]] and arranged an audition which resulted in a recording contract for her with Atlantic Records.

A mild [[stroke]] in the mid 1990s sidelined McCann for a while,<ref name="am" /> but in 2002 he released a new album, \'\'Pump it Up\'\'. McCann has also exhibited as a painter and photographer.<ref name="LF" />

\'\'\'L.T.D.\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[funk music|funk]] [[band (music)|band]] best known for their 1977 hit single, "[[(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again]]" and "[[Holding On (When Love Is Gone)]]", as well as their many ballads, such as "[[Love Ballad (L.T.D. song)|Love Ballad]]", "We Both Deserve Each Other\'s Love", and "Where Did We Go Wrong?".

==Career==
L.T.D. (which stands for Love, Togetherness, and Devotion), was formed in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], in 1968, when Arthur "Lorenzo" Carnegie ([[alto saxophone|alto]] and [[Tenor saxophone|tenor saxes]], [[flute]], [[guitar]]), Jake Riley ([[trombone]]) Carle Wayne Vickers ([[trumpet]], flute, [[soprano sax]]) and Abraham "Onion" Miller (tenor sax, vocals), who had been working as members of the 15 piece "Fantastic Soul Men Orchestra" backing the ever popular duo of [[Sam & Dave]], along with Jimmy "J.D." Davis ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], vocals), formed their own band named Love Men Ltd.  Then they drove to [[New York City]], in a car that they purchased together (a 1956 Chevy), and lived in the [[Hamilton Heights]] section of [[Harlem]] on 149th and Broadway, where Toby Wynn ([[baritone sax]]) joined them.  While performing on a gig in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Jeffrey Osborne]] (drums, lead vocals) was recruited by them.

After two years in New York, they drove two cars and a trailer to Los Angeles, California, where Jeffrey\'s brother, Billy Osborne (organ, drums, keyboards, co-lead vocals), Celeste Cole (vocals), Henry E. Davis (bass, vocals) and Robert Santiel (congas, percussion) joined them.  1974 found them signing with [[A&M Records]] as L.T.D. (Love Togetherness & Devotion). In 1976, Johnny McGhee (guitar) joined the band.  Jeffrey was moved out front as the lead vocalist, with Melvin Webb taking over on drums in 1977. Webb was replaced by Alvino Bennet in late 1978.

The group then went on to produce songs such as "[[Love Ballad (L.T.D. song)|Love Ballad]]", "[[(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again]]", "Concentrate On You", "[[Holding On (When Love Is Gone)]]", and many others. Soon after the band\'s 1980 album \'\'Shine On\'\', Jeffrey and Billy Osborne departed to start solo careers.  Andre Ray and Leslie Wilson (formerly of [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]]) were then chosen as lead vocalists their next album \'\'Love Magic\'\' which produced two more hits, "April Love", and "Kicking Back".  Leslie Wilson left to continue his solo career and L.T.D. stayed busy in the music industry by recording for small independent record labels, and doing their own personal music projects.

In 1999, a L.T.D. copycat band lost a federal court battle with the current three original members of L.T.D. retaining the rights, and ownership of the name L.T.D. The three original members, Arthur "Lorenzo" Carnegie (saxes,flute, guitar,vocals), Carle Wayne Vickers (trumpet,flute,saxes,vocals), Johnny McGhee (guitar, vocals), along with new members, Tresure(Mark Vincent Brown), (lead vocals,keys), Aya Iwata, (keys, vocals),Herbert Lee Woods (keys,vocals),Steve Toussaint (bass,vocals) and Tefere Hazy (drums, vocals) have been touring all over the U.S. since 1999.

Jake Riley (original trombonist), died in 2000, and James "JD" Davis (keyboards, vocals), died on May 22, 2008. Henry E. Davis died January 18, 2012 in Los Angeles, CA.

The band was seven members: Carlos Wilson (trombone, vocals), Lou Wilson (trumpet, vocals) and Ric Wilson (sax, vocals). The brothers were born in [[Panama]] and grew up in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] area of [[Brooklyn]]. Claude \'Coffee\' Cave II (keyboards, percussion, vocals, Bundy Cenac on bass for one album "Mandrill" replaced by Fudgie Kae Solomon in 1972 (bass, vocals), Charles Padro (drums, percussion, vocals) for two albums, replaced by Neftali Santiago in 1972 (drums, percussion, vocals), Omar Mesa (guitar, vocals) replaced by Doug Rodriguez in 1974 (lead guitar, vocals). This completed the Mandrill line-up from the Polydor years 1970\xe2\x80\x931975 which make up the Mandrill sound. Other members of the band in later years included Juaquin Jessup (lead guitar, percussion, vocals) and Tommy Trujillo on guitar.

Their songs have been sampled by many [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] acts such as Johnny D, [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[DJ Shadow]], [[Shawty Lo]], [[Big L]], [[Kanye West]], [[Jin (rapper)|Jin]], [[Eminem]], and [[9th Wonder]]. They combined funk with many other styles like [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[soul music|soul]].

Some of their songs have been used in the [[soundtrack]]s of films: \'\'[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]\'\' (1977) directed by [[Tom Gries]] and [[Monte Hellman]]; and \'\'[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]\'\' (1979) directed by [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]].  The band continues to perform live; their signature song is arguably "Fencewalk."

\'\'Composite Truth\'\' (1973) was the band\'s most commercially successful album.

\'\'\'Marvin Gaye\'\'\' ({{IPAc-en|\xc9\xa1|e\xc9\xaa}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gaye "Gaye"]. \'\'[[Random House Webster\'s Unabridged Dictionary]]\'\'.</ref> born \'\'\'Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.\'\'\'; April 2, 1939&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 April 1, 1984){{sfn|Simmonds|2008|pp=190\xe2\x80\x93192}} was an [[Americans|American]] singer, songwriter and musician. Gaye helped to shape the sound of [[Motown Records]] in the [[1960s in music|1960s]], first as an in house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of hits, including \'\'[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]\'\' and \'\'[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\'\', and duet recordings with [[Mary Wells]], [[Kim Weston]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], later earning the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|titles]] \'\'Prince of Motown\'\' and \'\'Prince of Soul\'\'. 

During the [[1970s in music|1970s]], he recorded the [[concept album]]s \'\'[[What\'s Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What\'s Going On]]\'\' and \'\'[[Let\'s Get It On]]\'\' and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of its production company.

Gaye\'s later recordings influenced several [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[subgenre]]s, such as [[quiet storm]] and [[neo-soul]].<ref name=spin>{{cite book |last=Weisbard |first=Eric |author2=Marks, Craig |title=Spin Alternative Record Guide (Ratings 1\xe2\x80\x9310) |edition=1st edi. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=50cEAAAACAAJ&dq=spin%27s+alternative+record |accessdate=2013-12-24 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York, NY |date=October 10, 1995 |isbn=0-679-75574-8 |oclc=32508105 |doi= |id= |pages=s. 202\xe2\x80\x93205 }}</ref> Following a period in Europe as a [[tax exile]] in the early [[1980s in music|1980s]], Gaye released the 1982 [[1983 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award-winning]] hit \'\'[[Sexual Healing]]\'\' and the \'\'[[Midnight Love]]\'\' album.

==Early life==
[[File:Columbia Heights 14th Street.JPG|thumb|right|Washington, D.C.\'s [[Columbia Heights (Washington, D.C.)|Columbia Heights]] where Marvin Gaye attended [[Cardozo Senior High School|Cardozo High School]], not far from [[Deanwood]], where he grew up]]

Marvin Gaye was born as Marvin Pentz Gay Jr. on April 2, 1939, in Washington, D.C., to church minister [[Marvin Gay Sr.]] and domestic worker [[Alberta Gay]] (n\xc3\xa9e Cooper). His first home was 1617 First Street SW, a few blocks from [[Anacostia River]]. The First Street neighborhood was nicknamed \'\'Simple City\'\', owing to its being "half-city, half country."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13}}{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=4}} When Gaye was in his teens, the family relocated to the [[Deanwood]] section of north eastern D.C. Gaye was the second eldest of Marvin Gay Sr.\'s children and the third overall of six. He had two sisters: Jeanne and Zeola, and three brothers: Michael Cooper, [[Frankie Gaye]] and Antwaun Gaye.<ref name=gayeplay>{{cite web|url=http://m.detnews.com/entertainment/article?a=2013302160303&f=1216|title=Gaye\'s second wife calls play \'completely and utterly exploitative\'|date=February 16, 2013|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Michael Cooper was from his mother\'s previous relationship while Antwaun was born as a result of his father\'s [[extramarital affair]]s.<ref name=gayeplay/>

Gaye started singing in church when he was four years old; his father often accompanied him on piano.{{sfn|Browne|2001|p=316}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=14}}{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=8}} Gaye and his family were part of a Pentecostal church known as the House of God. The House of God took its teachings from [[Hebrew]] [[Pentecostalism]], advocated strict conduct, and adhered to both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testaments.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=5}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=11}} Gaye developed a love of singing at an early age and was encouraged to pursue a professional music career after a performance at a school play.{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=8}} His home life consisted of "brutal whippings" by his father, who struck him for any shortcoming.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=12}} The young Gaye described living under his father\'s house as similar to "...living with a king, a very peculiar, changeable, cruel and all powerful king."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13}} He felt that had his mother not consoled him, and encouraged his singing, he would have killed himself.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=13: "If it wasn\'t for Mother, who was always there to console me and praise me for my singing, I think I would have been one of those child suicide cases you read about in the papers."}} His sister later explained that Gaye was beaten often, from age seven well into his teenage years.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=12: "From the time he was seven until he became a teenager, Marvin\'s life at home consisted of a series of brutal whippings."}}

Gaye attended [[Cardozo Senior High School|Cardozo High School]] and joined several [[doo-wop]] vocal groups, including the Dippers and the D.C. Tones.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=333}} Gaye\'s relationship with his father worsened during his teenage years, as his father would kick him out of the house often.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=25}} In 1956, 17-year-old Gaye dropped out of high school and enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] as a [[basic airman]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=34}}{{sfn|Redfern|2007|p=228}} Disappointed in having to perform menial tasks, he faked mental illness and was discharged shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=36}} Gaye\'s sergeant stated that he refused to follow orders.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=36}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0913051_marvin_gaye_1.html|title=Marvin Gaye No Military Hit|date=September 13, 2005|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Marvin Gaye promotional photo.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1959 promotional picture of [[Harvey Fuqua|Harvey]] and the \'\'New Moonglows\'\'. Gaye is fourth from the left behind a seated Fuqua.]]
Following his return, Gaye and good friend Reese Palmer formed the vocal [[quartet]] The Marquees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uncamarvy.com/Marquees/marquees.html |title=Marv Goldberg\'s R&B Notebooks \xe2\x80\x93 MARQUEES |accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=38}} The group performed in the D.C. area and soon began working with [[Bo Diddley]], who assigned the group to [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] subsidiary [[OKeh Records]] after failure to get the group signed to his own label, [[Chess Records|Chess]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=38}} The group\'s sole single, \'\'Wyatt Earp\'\', failed to chart and the group was soon dropped from the label.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=39}} Gaye began [[Musical composition|composing]] music during this period.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=39}}

[[The Moonglows|Moonglows]] co-founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] later hired The Marquees as employees.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=40}} Under Fuqua\'s direction, the group changed its name to \'\'Harvey and the New Moonglows\'\', and relocated to Chicago.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=47}} The group recorded several sides for Chess in 1959, including the song \'\'Mama Loocie\'\', which was Gaye\'s first lead vocal recording. The group found work as [[session singer]]s for established acts such as [[Chuck Berry]], singing on the hits \'\'[[Back in the U.S.A.]]\'\' and \'\'[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\'\'.

In 1960, the group disbanded. Gaye relocated to Detroit with Fuqua where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a [[session musician]], playing drums on several Tri-Phi releases. Gaye performed at [[Motown Records|Motown]] president [[Berry Gordy]]\'s house during the holiday season in 1960. Impressed by the singer, Gordy sought Fuqua on his contract with Gaye. Fuqua agreed to sell part of his interest in his contract with Gaye.{{sfn|Edmonds|2001a|p=24}} Shortly afterwards, Gaye signed with Motown subsidiary Tamla.

When Gaye signed with Tamla, he pursued a career as a performer of [[jazz]] music and [[standard (song)|standards]], having no desire to become an R&B performer.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=25}} Before the release of his first single, Gaye was teased about his surname, with some jokingly asking, "Is Marvin [[homosexuality|Gay]]?"{{sfn|Jet|1985b|p=17}} Gaye changed his surname by adding an \'\'e\'\', in the same way as did Sam Cooke. Author [[David Ritz]] wrote that Gaye did this to silence rumours of his sexuality, and to put more distance between Gaye and his father.{{sfn|Jet|1985b|p=17}}

Gaye released his first single, \xe2\x80\x9c[[Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide]],\xe2\x80\x9d in May 1961, with the album \'\'[[The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye]]\'\', following a month later. Gaye\'s initial recordings failed commercially. Gaye spent most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as [[The Miracles]] and [[The Marvelettes]], and was paid $5 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1961}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) a week to play drums for [[the Miracles]] and blues artist [[Jimmy Reed]].{{sfn|Bowman|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Des Barres|1996|p=107}} While Gaye took some advice on performing with his eyes open (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping), he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Roberts Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted.{{sfn|Posner|2002|p=116}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=88}}

===Initial success===
In 1962, Gaye found success as co-writer of the Marvelettes hit, \'\'[[Beechwood 4-5789]]\'\'. His first solo hit, \'\'[[Stubborn Kind of Fellow]]\'\', was later released that September, reaching number 8 on the R&B chart and number 46 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100. Gaye reached the top 50 with the dance song, \'\'[[Hitch Hike (song)|Hitch Hike]]\'\',<ref name=pc26>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19781/m1/ |title=Show 26 \xe2\x80\x93 The Soul Reformation: Phase two, the Motown story. [Part 5] }}</ref> peaking at number 30 on the Hot 100. \'\'[[Pride and Joy (Marvin Gaye song)|Pride and Joy]]\'\' became Gaye\'s first top ten single after its release in 1963.

The three singles and songs from the 1962 sessions were included on Gaye\'s second album, \'\'[[That Stubborn Kinda Fellow]]\'\'. Starting in October of the year, Gaye performed as part of the [[Motortown Revue]], a series of concert tours headlined at the north and south eastern coasts of the United States as part of the [[chitlin\' circuit]]. A filmed performance of Gaye at the [[Apollo Theater]] took place in June 1963. Later that October, Tamla issued the live album, \'\'[[Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage]]\'\'. \'\'[[Can I Get a Witness]]\'\' became one of Gaye\'s early international hits.

In 1964, Gaye recorded a successful duet album with singer [[Mary Wells]] titled \'\'[[Together (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells album)|Together]]\'\', which reached 42 on the pop album chart. The album\'s two-sided single, including \'\'[[Once Upon a Time (Marvin Gaye and Mary Wells song)|Once Upon a Time]]\'\' and \'\'[[What\'s the Matter With You Baby]]\'\', each reach the top 20. Gaye\'s next solo hit, \'\'[[How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)]]\'\', which [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] wrote for him, reached number 6 on the Hot 100 and reached the top 50 in the UK. Gaye started getting TV exposure around this time, on shows such as \'\'[[American Bandstand]]\'\'. Also in 1964, he appeared in the [[concert film]], \'\'[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]\'\'. Gaye had two number one R&B singles in 1965 with the [[The Miracles|Miracles]]-[[musical composition|composed]] \'\'[[I\'ll Be Doggone]]\'\' and \'\'[[Ain\'t That Peculiar]]\'\'. Both songs became million-sellers.

[[File:Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot of a 1967 performance by Gaye and Terrell during taping of the \'\'[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]\'\'.]]
After scoring a hit duet, \'\'[[It Takes Two (song)|It Takes Two]]\'\' with [[Kim Weston]], Gaye began working with [[Tammi Terrell]] on a series of duets, mostly composed by [[Ashford & Simpson]], including \'\'[[Ain\'t No Mountain High Enough]]\'\', \'\'[[Your Precious Love]]\'\', \'\'[[Ain\'t Nothing Like the Real Thing]]\'\', and \'\'[[You\'re All I Need to Get By]]\'\'.

{{Listen|filename=1968-marvin-gaye-grapevine.ogg|title="I Heard It through the Grapevine"|description="I Heard It through the Grapevine" was recorded by Gaye in April 1967, several months before [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]] recorded it. The song features a horror-based [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer]] piano solo, percussion, and horns. Gaye\'s recording of it paved the way for what later became "[[psychedelic soul]]".}}

In October 1967, Terrell collapsed in Gaye\'s arms during a performance in [[Farmville, Virginia]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} Terrell was subsequently rushed to Farmville\'s Southside Community Hospital, where doctors discovered she had a malignant [[brain tumour|tumour in her brain]].{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=65}} The diagnosis ended Terrell\'s career as a [[live music|live performer]], though she continued to record music under careful supervision. Despite the presence of hit singles such as \'\'[[Ain\'t Nothing Like the Real Thing]]\'\' and \'\'[[You\'re All I Need to Get By]]\'\', Terrell\'s illness caused problems with recording, and led to multiple operations to remove the tumor. Gaye was reportedly devastated by Terrell\'s sickness and became disillusioned with the record business.

In late 1968, Gaye\'s recording of \'\'[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\'\' became Gaye\'s first to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It also reached the top of the charts in other countries, selling over four million copies.{{sfn|Kempton|2005|p=207}} However, Gaye felt the success was something he "didn\'t deserve" and that he "felt like a puppet\xe2\x80\x94Berry\'s puppet, [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna]]\'s puppet...."{{sfn|Posner|2002|p=225}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=126}}{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=344}} Gaye followed it up with \'\'[[Too Busy Thinking About My Baby]]\'\' and \'\'[[That\'s the Way Love Is (The Isley Brothers song)|That\'s the Way Love Is]]\'\', which reached the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969. That year, his album \'\'[[M.P.G.]]\'\' became his first number one R&B album. Gaye produced and co-wrote two hits for [[The Originals]] during this period, including \'\'[[Baby I\'m For Real]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Bells (The Originals song)|The Bells]]\'\'.

On March 16, 1970, Tammi Terrell died from [[brain cancer]], and Gaye attended her funeral.{{sfn|Jet|1970|p=60}} Following this, he went into prolonged [[seclusion]] from the music business. After a period of depression, Gaye sought out a position on a [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] team, the [[Detroit Lions]], where he later befriended [[Mel Farr]] and [[Lem Barney]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Plautz |url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/92596 |title=Marvin Gaye, Detroit Lions Wide Receiver? |publisher=Mental Floss |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref> It was eventually decided that Gaye would not be allowed to try out owing to fears of possible injuries that could have affected his music career.<ref>[http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2009/07/29/music-legends-revealed-16/ Music Urban Legends Revealed #16].

===\'\'What\'s Going On\'\' and subsequent success===
{{Main|What\'s Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|Let\'s Get It On}}
On June 1, 1970, Gaye returned to [[Hitsville U.S.A.]], where he recorded his new composition \'\'[[What\'s Going On (song)|What\'s Going On]]\'\', inspired by an idea from [[Renaldo "Obie" Benson]] of the [[Four Tops]] after he witnessed an act of [[police brutality]] at an [[anti-war]] rally in Berkeley.{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|pp=155}} Upon hearing the song, Berry Gordy refused its release due to his feelings of the song being "too political" for radio.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=16}}</ref> Gaye responded by going on strike from recording until the label released the song.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Released in 1971, it reached number one on the R&B charts within a month, staying there for five weeks. It also reached the top spot on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]\'s pop chart for a week and reached number two on the Hot 100 and the [[Record World]] chart, selling over two million copies.{{sfn|Vincent|1996|p=129}}{{sfn|Whitburn|2004|p=250}}

After giving an ultimatum to record a full album to win creative control from Motown, Gaye spent ten days recording the \'\'What\'s Going On\'\' album that March.{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}} Motown issued the album that May after Gaye remixed portions of the album in Hollywood.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> The album became Gaye\'s first million-selling album launching two more top ten singles, \'\'[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]]\'\' and \'\'[[Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)|Inner City Blues]]\'\'. One of Motown\'s first autonomous works, its theme and segue flow brought the [[concept album]] format to rhythm and blues.

Marvin\'s final duet project, \'\'[[Diana & Marvin]]\'\', with [[Diana Ross]], garnered international success.

A renewed contract with Motown allowed Gaye to build his own [[Marvin\'s Room (recording studio)|custom-made recording studio]].

In October 1975, Gaye gave a performance at a [[UNESCO]] benefit concert at New York\'s [[Radio City Music Hall]] to support UNESCO\'s African literacy drive, resulting in him being commended at the United Nations by then-Ambassador to [[Ghana]] [[Shirley Temple Black]] and [[Kurt Waldheim]].{{sfn|Jet|1975|p=19}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=208}} Gaye\'s next studio album, \'\'[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)|I Want You]]\'\', followed in 1976 with the [[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|title track]] becoming a number-one R&B hit. That summer, Gaye embarked on his first European tour in a decade, starting off in England. In early 1977, Gaye issued the live album, \'\'[[Live at the London Palladium]]\'\', which sold over two million copies thanks to the success of its studio song, \'\'[[Got to Give It Up]]\'\', which became a number one hit.

In December 1978, Gaye issued \'\'[[Here, My Dear]]\'\', inspired by the fallout of his first marriage to [[Anna Gordy Gaye|Anna Gordy]]. Recorded as an intent for Gaye to remit a portion of its royalties to her to receive [[alimony]] payments, it flopped on the charts.<ref name=snopes>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/music/hidden/heredear.asp |title=Marvin Gaye Here, My Dear |work=snopes.com |date=September 16, 1994 |accessdate=November 28, 2012}}</ref> During that period, Gaye developed a serious [[substance dependence|dependence and addiction]] to [[cocaine]] and was dealing with several financial issues with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. These issues led him to move to [[Maui]], where he struggled to record a [[disco]] album.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=265}} In 1980, Gaye went on a European tour.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=267}} By the time the tour stopped, the singer relocated to London where he feared [[imprisonment]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], which had now reached upwards of $4.5 million.(US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500000|1980}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}){{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=267}}{{sfn|Gates|2004|p=333}}

Gaye then reworked \'\'Love Man\'\' from its original disco concept to another personal album invoking religion and the possible [[end time]] from a chapter in the [[Book of Revelation]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=266-267}} Titling the album, \'\'[[In Our Lifetime (Marvin Gaye album)|In Our Lifetime?]]\'\', Gaye worked on the album for much of 1980 in London studios such as [[Air Studios|Air]] and [[Odyssey Studios]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=270-275}}

[[File:Willy Bosschem - Marvin Gaye.JPG|thumb|Marvin Gaye by the Belgian artist Willy Bosschem]]
On February 14, 1981, under the advice of music promoter [[Freddy Cousaert]], Gaye relocated to Cousaert\'s apartment in [[Ostend]], Belgium.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=282}} While there, Gaye shied away from heavy [[substance dependence|drug use]] and began exercising and attending a local Ostend church, regaining personal confidence.{{sfn|Gaye|2003|p=320}}{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=283}} Following several months of recovery, Gaye sought a comeback onstage, starting the short-lived \'\'Heavy Love Affair\'\' tour in England and Ostend between June and July 1981.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=284}} Gaye\'s personal attorney Curtis Shaw would later describe Gaye\'s Ostend period as "the best thing that ever happened to Marvin". When word got around that Gaye was planning a musical comeback and an exit from Motown, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Urban]] president Larkin Arnold eventually was able to convince Gaye to sign with CBS. On March 23, 1982, Motown and [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] negotiated Gaye\'s release from Motown. The details of the contract were not revealed due to a possible negative effect on the singer\'s settlement to creditors from the IRS.{{sfn|Jet|1982|p=59}}

Assigned to CBS\' [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] subsidiary, Gaye worked on his first post-Motown album titled \'\'[[Midnight Love]]\'\'. The first single, \'\'[[Sexual Healing]]\'\', was released on September 30, 1982, and became Marvin\'s biggest career hit, spending a record ten weeks at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] chart, becoming the biggest R&B hit of the 1980s according to Billboard stats. The success later translated to the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in January 1983 where it peaked at number three, while the record reached international success, reaching the top spot in [[RIANZ|New Zealand]] and [[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] and reaching the top ten on the United Kingdom\'s [[Official Charts Company|OCC singles chart]], later selling over two million copies in the US alone, becoming Gaye\'s most successful single to date.

\'\'Sexual Healing\'\' won Gaye his first two [[Grammy Award]]s including [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]], in February 1983, and also won Gaye an [[American Music Award]] in the [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]-soul category. \'\'[[People (magazine)|People]]\'\' magazine called it  "America\'s hottest musical turn-on since [[Olivia Newton John]] demanded we get \'\'[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]].\'\' \'\'Midnight Love\'\' was released to stores a day after the single\'s release, and was equally successful, peaking at the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] and becoming Gaye\'s eighth number-one album on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top Black Albums]] chart, eventually selling over six million copies worldwide, three million alone in the United States.

==Musicianship==
[[File:Marvin Gaye in 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Marvin Gaye in 1973]]

===Influences===
As a child, Gaye\'s main influence was his minister father, something he later acknowledged to biographer [[David Ritz]], and also in interviews, often mentioning that his father\'s sermons greatly impressed him. His first major musical influences were [[doo-wop]] groups such as [[The Moonglows]] and [[The Capris]]. Gaye\'s [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] page lists the Capris\' song, \'\'God Only Knows\'\' as "critical to his musical awakening."<ref name="Marvin Gaye Biography">{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/marvin-gaye/bio/ |title=Marvin Gaye Biography |work=The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Of the Capris\' song, Gaye said, "It fell from the heavens and hit me between the eyes. So much soul, so much hurt. I related to the story, to the way that no one except the Lord really can read the heart of lonely kids in love."{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=27}} Gaye\'s main musical influences were Rudy West of [[The Five Keys]], [[Clyde McPhatter]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Little Willie John]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=5}}</ref>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=29}} Gaye considered [[Frank Sinatra]] a major influence in what he wanted to be.{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=29}} He also was influenced by the vocal styles of [[Billy Eckstine]] and [[Nat King Cole]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=30}}

Later on as his Motown career developed, Gaye would seek inspiration in fellow label mates such as [[David Ruffin]] of [[The Temptations]] and [[Levi Stubbs]] of the [[Four Tops]] as their grittier voices led to Gaye and his producer seeking a similar sound in recordings such as "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" and "[[That\'s the Way Love Is (The Isley Brothers song)|That\'s the Way Love Is]]". Later in his life, Gaye reflected on the influence of Ruffin and Stubbs stating, "I had heard something in their voices something my own voice lacked".<ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=14}}</ref>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} He further explained, "the [[The Temptations|Tempts]] and [[Four Tops|Tops]]\' music made me remember that when a lot of women listen to music, they want to feel the power of a real man."<ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}}

===Vocal range===
Gaye had a three-octave [[vocal range]].{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=82}} From his earlier recordings as member of the Marquees and Harvey and the New Moonglows, and in his first several recordings with Motown, Gaye recorded mainly in the [[baritone]] and [[tenor]] ranges. He changed his tone to a rasp for his gospel-inspired early hits such as \'\'Stubborn Kind of Fellow\'\' and \'\'Hitch Hike\'\'. As writer [[Eddie Holland]] explained, "He was the only singer I have ever heard known to take a song of that nature, that was so far removed from his natural voice where he liked singing, and do whatever it took to sell that song."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=8}}</ref>

In songs such as \'\'Pride & Joy\'\', Gaye used three different vocal ranges\xe2\x80\x94singing in his baritone range at the beginning, bringing a lighter tenor in the verses before reaching a gospel mode in the chorus. Holland further stated of Gaye\'s voice that it was "...one of the sweetest and prettiest voices you ever wanted to hear."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=9}}</ref> And while he noted that ballads and jazz was "his basic soul", he stated Gaye "...had the ability to take a roughhouse, rock and roll, blues, R&B, any kind of song and make it his own," later saying that Gaye was the most versatile vocalist he had ever worked with.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Gaye changed his vocal style in the late 1960s, when he was advised to use a sharper, raspy voice\xe2\x80\x94especially in Norman Whitfield\'s recordings. Gaye initially disliked the new style, considering it out of his range, but said he was "into being produce-able."<ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/> After listening to David Ruffin and Levi Stubbs, Gaye said he started to develop what he called his "tough man voice"\xe2\x80\x94saying, "I developed a growl."<ref name="Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing"/>{{sfn|Ritz|1991|p=100}} In the liner notes of his DVD set, \'\'Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981\'\', Rob Bowman said that by the early 1970s, Gaye had developed "...three distinct voices; his smooth, sweet tenor, a growling rasp, and an unreal [[falsetto]]."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Rob |title=Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing |journal= Marvin Gaye: The Real Thing in Performance 1964\xe2\x80\x931981 |date=April 2006 |page=15}}</ref> Bowman further wrote that the recording of the \'\'What\'s Going On\'\' single was "...the first single to utilize all three as Marvin developed a radical approach to constructing his recordings by layering a series of contrapuntal background vocal lines on different tracks, each one conceived and sung in isolation by Marvin himself."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Bowman cites Gaye\'s multi-tracking of his tenor voice and other vocal styles "summon[ed] up what might be termed the ancient art of weaving".<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Social commentary and concept albums===
Prior to recording the \'\'What\'s Going On\'\' album, Gaye recorded a cover of the song, "[[Abraham, Martin & John]]", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by [[The Temptations]] in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social events such as the 1965 [[Watts riots]] and once asked himself, "with the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?"{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=156}} When the singer called Gordy in the Bahamas about wanting to do [[protest music]], Gordy cautioned him, "Marvin, don\'t be ridiculous. That\'s taking things too far."{{sfn|Lynskey|2011|p=157}}

Once Gaye presented Gordy with the \'\'What\'s Going On\'\' album, Gordy feared Gaye was risking the ruination of his image as a sex symbol.<ref name=ReferenceC/> Following the album\'s success, Gaye tried a follow-up album that he would label \'\'You\'re the Man\'\'. The [[You\'re the Man|title track]] only produced modest success, however, and Gaye and Motown shelved the album. Later on, several of Gaye\'s unreleased songs of social commentary, including "[[The World Is Rated X]]", would be issued on posthumous compilation albums. \'\'What\'s Going On\'\' would later be described by an [[AllMusic]] writer as an album that "not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4344/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Allmusic (((Marvin Gaye \xe2\x80\x93 Overview)))|accessdate=January 9, 2009}}</ref>

The album also provided another first in both Motown and R&B music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album in a [[song cycle]], segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R&B albums that traditionally included [[filler (music)|filler tracks]] to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Barry White]] making the concept album format a part of 1970s R&B music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album\'s concept. \'\'Let\'s Get It On\'\' repeated the suite-form arrangement of \'\'What\'s Going On\'\', as would Gaye\'s later albums such as \'\'I Want You\'\', \'\'Here, My Dear\'\' and \'\'In Our Lifetime\'\'.

\'\'\'The Meters\'\'\' are an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] band based in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]]. The Meters performed and recorded their own music from the late 1960s until 1977.  The band played an influential role as backing musicians for other artists, including [[Lee Dorsey]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], and [[Dr. John]]. The Meters acted as the house band for [[Allen Toussaint]]\'s New Orleans soul classics of the 1960s and are responsible for bringing New Orleans [[Second line (parades)|second line]] grooves into popular music.

While The Meters rarely enjoyed significant mainstream success, they are considered, along with artists like [[James Brown]], one of the progenitors of [[funk]] music and their work is influential on many other bands, both their contemporaries and modern musicians working in the funk idiom.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The Meters\' sound is defined by an earthy combination of tight melodic grooves and highly syncopated New Orleans "second-line" rhythms under highly charged guitar and keyboard riffing. Their songs "[[Cissy Strut]]" and "[[Look-Ka Py Py]]" are considered funk classics.<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3430600053.htm]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

==History==

===The 1960s and 1970s===
[[Art Neville]], the group\'s [[frontman]], launched a solo career around the [[New Orleans]] area in the mid-1950s while still in high school. The Meters formed in 1965 with a line-up of keyboardist and vocalist Art Neville, guitarist [[Leo Nocentelli]], bassist [[George Porter Jr.]] and drummer [[Zigaboo Modeliste|Joseph "Zigaboo" Modeliste]]. They were later joined by percussionist/vocalist [[Cyril Neville]]. The Meters became the house band for [[Allen Toussaint]] and his [[record label]], Sansu Enterprises.

In 1969 the Meters released "Sophisticated Cissy" and "[[Cissy Strut]]", both major [[R&B]] chart hits.  "Look-Ka Py Py" and "Chicken Strut" were their hits the following year.  After a label shift in 1972, the Meters had difficulty returning to the charts, but they worked with [[Dr. John]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[King Biscuit Boy]], [[Labelle]], [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] and others.<ref name="allbio">{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-meters-mn0000402872/biography |title=The Meters &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

In 1975 Paul McCartney invited the Meters to play at the release party for his \'\'[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]\'\' album aboard the \'\'Queen Mary\'\' in [[Long Beach, California]]; [[Mick Jagger]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] was in attendance at the event and was greatly taken with the Meters and their sound.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  The Rolling Stones invited the band to open for them on their [[Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas \'75|Tour of the Americas \'75]] and [[Rolling Stones Tour of Europe \'76|Tour of Europe \'76]].<ref name="allbio"/> That same year, the Meters recorded one of their most successful albums, \'\'[[Fire on the Bayou]]\'\'. From 1976 to \'77 they played in [[The Wild Tchoupitoulas]] with George & Amos Landry and the [[Neville Brothers]].

Art and Cyril Neville left the band in early 1977, but The Meters still appeared on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' on March 19, 1977, during the [[Saturday Night Live (season 2)|show\'s second season]]. After the Nevilles\' departure, David Batiste, Sr. took over on keyboards while Willie West joined as the band\'s lead singer. Porter left the group later that year and by 1980 The Meters had officially broken up.

After the break-up, Neville gained fame as part of [[The Neville Brothers]], Modeliste toured with [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ron Wood]], while Nocentelli and Porter "became in-demand session players and formed new bands."<ref name="sfgate">{{cite web | title = A bad contract tore New Orleans\' Meters apart, but they\'re back and rebuilding after the storm| url= http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-11-14/entertainment/17399361_1_april-s-new-orleans-jazz-leo-nocentelli-marshall-sehorn | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=November 14, 2005| author=Jeff Chang| accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref>

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1989 Art Neville, George Porter Jr. and Leo Nocentelli reunited as The Meters, adding drummer Russel Batiste Jr. to replace Zigaboo Modeliste. When Nocentelli left the group in 1994 they replaced him with guitarist Brian Stoltz, formerly of The Neville Brothers and renamed themselves \'\'\'The Funky Meters\'\'\'. (They were referred to as "the Funky Meters" as early as 1989. They were billed as such when playing in a tiny venue at Bordeaux & Camp Street behind Le Bon Temps Roule.)<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Rose |url=http://www.nola.com/voodoofest/index.ssf/2011/08/latest_meters_reunion_to_roll.html |title=Latest Meters reunion to roll on at least through Voodoo Fest |publisher=NOLA.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

===2000s===
The Funky Meters continued to play into the 2000s with  Stoltz being replaced by Art Neville\'s son, Ian Neville, from 2007 to 2011 while he went to pursue a solo career. Stoltz returned to the band permanently in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://funkymeters.com/about |title=About |publisher=Funkymeters.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

In 2000, a "big offer" enticed all four original Meters to reunite for a one-night stand at the [[The Warfield|Warfield]] in San Francisco; by this time Modeliste wanted to make the reunion a permanent one, but the other members and their management teams objected.<ref name="sfgate"/>  It wasn\'t until [[Quint Davis]], producer and director of the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]],  got them to "put aside their differences and hammer out the details" and perform at the Festival in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swagland.com/jazzfest/cubes/2006/20060430.html |title=2006 - 1ST SUNDAY - APRIL 30, 2006 |publisher=Swagland.com |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

In June 2011 The Original Meters along with Allen Toussaint and Dr. John played the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The six men performed Dr. John\'s album "Desitively Bonnaroo" which was originally recorded with the Meters, to a sold out crowd. On May 5, 2012 The Meters returned to New Orleans for a performance at the Howlin\' Wolf. Tickets went on sale and sold out in one and a half hours.

On October 31 and November 1, 2012, Zigaboo Modeliste, Leo Nocentelli, and George Porter Jr. played concerts with [[Phish]] keyboardist [[Page McConnell]] at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill under the name \'\'\'The Metermen\'\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbkingblues.com/bio.php?id=1979 |title=B.B. King Blues Club & Grill - THE METER MEN - Oct 31, 2012 |publisher=Bbkingblues.com |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

During his time off from manning the role of Chairman of The Boards in PHiSH, Page McConnell has continued to play with Porter Jr., Nocentelli, and Modeliste under the moniker of The Metermen since those shows in 2012. The Metermen had performed 16 shows together as of spring 2015, with their third annual appearance as a late night act during New Orleans\' Jazz and Heritage Festival on the horizon (the two shows were scheduled for April 24th and 25th, 2015, at NOLA\'s Joy Theater). <ref>http://phish.net/sideshows/page-mcconnell/?d=2015-04-24</ref> <ref>http://phish.net/sideshows/page-mcconnell/?d=2015-04-25</ref>

In 2014, during The Metermen\'s second appearance as a late night act during Jazzfest, the band performed at The Republic on Saturday, April 26th, 2014, after McConnell had headlined the NOLA Jazzfest at the New Orleans Fairgrounds with PHiSH earlier that day. <ref>http://phish.net/setlists/?showid=1389720611</ref> <ref>http://phish.net/sideshows/page-mcconnell/?showid=1393953880</ref> The Metermen had also played the previous night (4/25/14) at The Republic. <ref>http://phish.net/sideshows/page-mcconnell/?d=2014-04-25</ref>

The states The Metermen had appeared in as of spring 2015 were Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Colorado, and Vermont, with one other performance in Washington D.C. <ref>http://phish.net/people/george-porter-jr/appearances</ref> <ref>http://phish.net/people/zigaboo-modeliste/appearances</ref> <ref>http://phish.net/people/leo-nocentelli/appearances</ref>

The Meters have been nominated for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] three times since becoming eligible in 1994: 1996, 2012, and in 2013.

Currently, The Funky Meters tour consistently performing songs by The Meters, while The Meters perform sporadically. The line up of Neville, Porter, Nocentelli and Modeliste typically bill themselves as The Original Meters to avoid confusion with The Funky Meters. When not performing with The Original Meters, guitarist Leo Nocentelli leads his own group, The Meters Experience which also performs the music of The Meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nocentelli.com/html/index.html |title=Welcome To The Meters Experience Website |publisher=Nocentelli.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>

==Overview==
Assembled by [[record producer]]s [[Kenneth Gamble]] and [[Leon Huff]], MFSB was the [[house band]] for their [[Philadelphia International Records]] [[record label|label]] and originated the signature smooth "[[Philly sound]]" sound that dominated the early 1970s for the artists who recorded at the Sigma Sound Studios, including the O\'Jays, the Spinners, the Bluenotes, [[The Delfonics]], [[Blue Magic (band)|Blue Magic]], [[The Intruders (music group)|The Intruders]], [[The Three Degrees|Three Degrees]], [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], and [[Teddy Pendergrass]].  Later in the decade, the collective would become known for the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]]-dominated [[disco]] sounds that became popular in the late 1970s with groups such as [[The Trammps]], [[First Choice (band)|First Choice]], [[Ripple (band)|Ripple]] and [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]].

It was the 1972 release of their first album, \'\'MFSB\'\', that put them on the map. This marked the beginning of a string of instrumental hits that brought major attention to a large orchestra who laid the foundation for the Sound of Philadelphia. The line-up of musicians included Karl Chambers, [[Earl Young (drummer)|Earl Young]], and Norman Fearrington on drums; [[Norman Harris]], Roland Chambers, [[Bobby Eli]], and TJ Tindall on guitar; Winnie Wilford and [[Ronnie Baker]] on bass; [[Vincent Montana, Jr.]] and Larry Washington on vibes and percussion, [[Harold Ivory Williams]] on keyboards,  plus Leon Huff and Thom Bell on keyboards and Don Renaldo on strings and horns featuring Rocco Bene on trumpet.

MFSB\'s disco sound first hit the top of the Hot 100 charts as the backing band for [[The O\'Jays]]\' "[[Love Train]]" in March, 1973.

In 2005, drummer Keith Benson (who had joined the group upon Young\'s departure) revived the group with Gamble\'s help.  The lineup included himself on drums, Jimmy Williams on bass, Dennis Harris and Barton French on guitars, and vocalists Carla Benson, Johnny Ingram, and Michael Clark.  In 2007, Philadelphia\'s Inner City Horns (George Bussey, Jr. - saxophone, Bill Hosbach, Jr. - trumpet, and Matt Vernon - trombone) were added to the mix.  The group performs live at private and concert events, and was featured at the inauguration of Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter.

==Career==
In the spring of 1974, Philadelphia International released an [[instrumental]] track which had been recorded by the band as the [[theme music]] for the [[television]] show \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\' as a single. The record, titled "[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]" reached number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and also topped the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] and the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]].<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). \'\'The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\'\'</ref>  The success of "TSOP" launched a recording career for the band under their own name. MFSB albums and singles were released for the rest of the decade.  

MFSB recorded a cover of [[New Birth (band)|The Nite-Liters]]\'s 1971 instrumental "K-Jee", which gained some popularity when it was featured in a key scene in the film \'\'[[Saturday Night Fever]]\'\' (1977).  It is also included in the soundtrack to that movie.  "Sexy" (1975) was later used as a prize cue for the "Big Deal of the Day" on the 1980 version of \'\'[[Let\'s Make a Deal]]\'\'.  

Another popular MFSB number, "Love Is The Message", has been a favorite of dance/disco [[Disc jockey|DJs]] since its release; countless [[remix]]es, both official and unofficial, exist of the song. On September 20, 2004, the record became among the first to be inducted into the newly formed [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]]. In October 2004, the song appeared in the [[video game]], \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]\'\', playing on funk radio station, [[Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas_soundtrack#Bounce_FM|Bounce FM]].

Due to a disagreement with Gamble & Huff over finances, several members of the group moved on to [[Salsoul Records]], where they became known as [[The Salsoul Orchestra]]. Other members began performing as [[The Ritchie Family]] orchestra, and [[John Davis and the Monster Orchestra]]. Not to be outdone, Gamble & Huff replaced them with a new [[rhythm section]] consisting of Charles Collins on drums, Michel Foreman on bass guitar, and Dennis Harris on lead guitar. They also employed [[Dexter Wansel]] and others on MFSB\'s latter recordings for the label.

Since 1980, MFSB\'s "My Mood" has been the closing theme music for the Friday 6:00 p.m. newscast on [[WRC-TV]] (NBC4), the [[NBC]]-owned television station in [[Washington, D.C.]].  MFSB\'s "TLC" (Tender Lovin\' Care) has been used for decades as the closing credits theme for the Washington, DC version of the "It\'s Academic" quiz show filmed at WRC-TV.

In 2008, some of the members appeared together on new recordings made at Bobby Eli\xe2\x80\x99s Studio E/The Grooveyard in the Philly suburbs. Musicians on the session were Earl Young on drums, Bobby Eli and Dennis Harris on guitars, Jimmie Williams on bass guitar, Rikki Hicks on percussion and T G Conway on keys. Two songs have been released from that sessions namely \xe2\x80\x98Soul Recession\xe2\x80\x99 by Double Exposure and \xe2\x80\x98There I go falling in love again\xe2\x80\x99 by Chiquita Green.

==Name origin==
According to the book \'\'A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul\'\', by John A. Jackson, the "clean" version of the MFSB name means "Mother, Father, Sister, Brother", because according to Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, despite the diversity at Philadelphia International Records, all were connected musically. This was in line with their spiritual views at the time. The "other" version was "Mother-Fucking Sons of Bitches", referring to musical prowess.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xSErq0ssG74C&pg=PT160 \'\'A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul:\'\', p.115], John A. Jackson</ref>

 ****** New Birth (band)

b'{{unreferenced|date=September 2014}}
\'\'\'New Birth\'\'\' (also known as \'\'\'The New Birth\'\'\') is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group. It was originally conceived in [[Detroit, Michigan]] by former [[Motown]] songwriter/producer, [[Vernon Bullock]] and co-founded in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by him with former singer and [[Motown]] songwriter/producer [[Harvey Fuqua]] and musicians, Tony Churchill, James Baker, Austin Lander, Robert "Lurch" Jackson, Leroy Taylor, Charlie Hearndon and Nathaniel "Nebs" Neblett.

==History==
The history of the group began with the instrumental outfit, \'\'\'The Nite-Liters\'\'\', which was originally formed in 1963 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] by Tony Churchill and Harvey Fuqua. In its heyday, besides Churchill on tenor sax and vibes, the band featured Charlie Hearndon on guitar, James Baker on keyboards, Robin Russell on drums, Robert "Lurch" Jackson on trumpet, Austin Lander on baritone sax, Leroy Taylor on bass, and, later, Carl McDaniel on guitar. Earlier members included Johnny Graham, later of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] and Jerry Bell also a member at one time.

Under this name, the group had a few hits before the formation of New Birth proper, including "K-Jee" (#17 R&B, #39 pop,1971). In 1969, Vernon Bullock had thought of creating an ensemble of groups for a touring company and [[Harvey Fuqua]] and Tony Churchill soon took an interest. After discovering a male vocal group, The Now Sound, which featured Bobby Downs, Ron Coleman, Gary Young and an individual known as "Slim," and also a female vocal group, known as Mint Julep, which featured Londee Loren, Tanita Gaines, Janice Carter and Pam Swent, they brought them together with The Nite-Liters plus additional vocalist, Alan Frye, calling the newly formed ensemble, [[New Birth]]. The band came together in 1970 with their self-titled debut on [[RCA Records|RCA]]. Their second album, \'\'Ain\'t No Big Thing, But It\'s Growing\'\', yielded a minor hit with their cover of [[Perry Como]]\'s "It\'s Impossible", in 1971.

Later that year, Bullock discovered a group from [[Detroit, Michigan]] called Love, Peace & Happiness, which featured former [[The Marvelettes|Marvelettes]] singer Ann Bogan and brothers Leslie and Melvin Wilson. Finding that they had the spark that was missing from the New Birth ensemble, he paired them with the Nite-Liters and original members of New Birth, Londee Loren, Bobby Downs and Alan Frye.

In 1972, the reorganized group (as a 17-piece ensemble) reached the Billboard R&B top 10 (#4 R&B, #35 pop) with their cover of [[Bobby Womack]] and [[The Valentinos]]\' "[[I Can Understand It]]", which paved the way for the band\'s future success. By the time the song hit the stores, however, Ann had left to devote time to her family, leaving Londee Loren as the only female member. When Harvey reportedly could not get the performance he wanted out of Londee on their next hit, "[[Until It\'s Time for You to Go]]", it featured, instead of the group members, future [[The Supremes|Supremes]] member [[Susaye Greene]] as lead vocalist, with Harvey and Carolyn Willis of [[the Honey Cone|Honey Cone]] doing the spoken intro. However, Londee more than met the challenge in live performances and her voice matured on future releases.

In 1974, the group issued their album, \'\'It\'s Been a Long Time\'\', which featured hits including the title track (#9 R&B) and their cover of the [[Skylark]] song "[[Wildflower (Skylark song)|Wildflower]]". After the release of their sixth RCA album, \'\'Comin\' From All Ends\'\', the group split from RCA, Fuqua and their management company and signed with [[Buddah Records|Buddah]].

New Birth\'s Buddah debut, \'\'Blind Baby\'\', featured the group\'s only number-one R&B single, a cover of the [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]] classic, "Dream Merchant". By this time, the Nite-Liters had so merged with the New Birth. that the instrumental cut that opened the album was solely credited to New Birth. A move to Warner produced several minor hits and the release of the 1977 album, \'\'Behold The Mighty Army\'\', the Wilson brothers left following disagreements in the group.

The group including Baker, Churchill and Lander returned on Ariola in 1979 with Jerry Bell as their lead vocalist on \'\'Platinum City\'\' and in 1982 with the \'\'I\'m Back\'\' album. Leslie Wilson had left the group to replace [[Jeffrey Osborne]] in [[L.T.D. (band)|L.T.D.]] whilst Jerry Bell departed in 1981 to become lead vocalist for Motown\'s [[Dazz Band]].

The Wilsons toured with a new ensemble as New Birth in 1994, and released a few albums under the new name in the decade since. Drummer [[Robin Russell]] released a solo CD entitled \'\'Drum Beats\'\' in 2004.

Since the group\'s initial split, their songs have been covered by the likes of [[Jamie Foxx]], who sampled their cover of "Wildflower" for his 2005 hit, "[[Unpredictable (song)|Unpredictable]]". R&B group [[Something for the People]] sampled their "It\'s Been a Long Time" for their 1996 hit, "My Love is the Shhh".  Rap artist [[Lil\' Wayne]] sampled "You Don\'t Have to Be Alone" from their self-titled album in his song "La La", And again [[Jerry Bell\'s]] remake of "Its Been A Long Time."  "You Are What I\'m All About" was sampled for [[Junior Mafia]]\'s "[[Player\'s Anthem]]" and possibly for [[Britney Spears]]\' "Sippin\' On".

New Birth, particularly lead vocalist Leslie Wilson was a chief influence on Soul artist [[Reggie Sears]] and [[Temptations]] lead singer [[Ali "Ollie" Woodson]].

James Baker died in 1993, Leroy Taylor died on January 17, 2012 and producer Vernon Bullock died March 18, 2015 at the age of 70 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

\'\'\'The Olympic Runners\'\'\' were a 1970s [[United Kingdom|British]] [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]], put together by [[record producer]] [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] who also played [[percussion instrument|percussion]], and [[frontman|fronted]] by [[singer]] George Chandler.  They also included multi-instrumentalist [[Pete Wingfield]], and had a number of [[hit single]]s in both the [[United States|US]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]].

==History==
In 1973, Mike Vernon, a British record producer and founder of [[Blue Horizon Records]], put together a group of [[session musicians]] to play on an album with [[blues]] musician [[Jimmy Dawkins]], to be recorded at [[Olympic Studios]] in [[London]].  The musicians included keyboard player and vocalist Pete Wingfield, singer George Chandler, [[guitar]]ist [[Joe Jammer]], [[bass guitar|bassist]] DeLisle Harper, and [[drummer]] Glen LeFleur,<ref name="amg">{{cite web|author=Amy Hanson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/olympic-runners-mn0000899566 |title=Olympic Runners &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>  of whom Chandler, Harper and LeFleur were also members of jazz-funk band [[Gonzalez (band)|Gonzalez]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gonzalez-mn0000660532 |title=Gonzalez &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref> When Dawkins\' arrival was delayed, the musicians recorded a funk track in the spare studio time.  Vernon then sold the track, "Put The Music Where Your Mouth Is", credited to The Olympic Runners, to [[London Records]] in [[New York]], and in 1974 it became a hit on the US [[R&B Chart]], reaching no. 72.<ref name="wingfield">{{cite web|author= |url=http://dmme.net/interviews/wingfield.html |title=Interview with PETE WINGFIELD |publisher=DMME.net |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>

Following its success, the musicians recorded an album, including the track "Grab It" which also made the R&B charts. They recorded a second album, \'\'Out in Front\'\', in 1975, shortly before Wingfield had his own solo hit single, "Eighteen With A Bullet".  A third album, \'\'Don\'t Let Up\'\', soon followed, together with a succession of singles.  The 1976 album \'\'Hot To Trot\'\' has been cited as their finest.<ref name="amg"/> Wingfield described the recording process:<blockquote>"Barry Hammond the engineer would always keep a 2-track quarter-inch tape running so as to catch us jamming between takes - then we\'d use that jamming as the basis for the next track. It was painless, we made album after album that way, it only took a couple of weeks out of the year, and we were selling records! For the first few years the band were completely anonymous - people assumed we were a US act..."<ref name="wingfield"/></blockquote>  Their commercial success diminished in the US at the same time as it grew in the UK, and their biggest successes in the UK charts came in 1978-79, with the hit singles "Get It While You Can" and "Sir Dancealot".<ref name="betts">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year= 2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st| publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page= 569}}</ref>  In 1979 they also performed the theme tune for the film \'\'[[The Bitch (film)|The Bitch]]\'\', starring [[Joan Collins]],<ref name="amg"/> which gave them a third UK Top 40 hit.

The group split up in 1979. Vernon and Wingfield later joined [[Rocky Sharpe & the Replays]], and the other band members continued as session musicians.<ref name="amg"/> Several Olympic Runners tracks have been [[Sampling (music)|sample]]d by later artists, including [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]].<ref name="wingfield"/>

\'\'\'Parliament\'\'\' was a [[funk]] band most prominent during the 1970s. Both Parliament and its sister act, [[Funkadelic]], were led by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]].

==History==
\'\'\'Parliament\'\'\' was originally [[The Parliaments]], a [[doo-wop]] vocal group based at a [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] barbershop. The group was formed in the late 1950s and included [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Ray Davis (musician)|Ray Davis]], [[Fuzzy Haskins]], [[Calvin Simon]], and [[Grady Thomas]]. Clinton was the group leader and manager. The group finally had a hit single in 1967 with "[[(I Wanna) Testify]]" on Revilot Records. To capitalize, Clinton formed a backing band for a tour, featuring teenage barbershop employee [[Billy Bass Nelson]] on bass and his friend [[Eddie Hazel]] on guitar, with the lineup eventually rounded out by [[Tawl Ross]] on guitar, [[Tiki Fulwood]] on drums, and Mickey Atkins on organ.

During a contractual dispute with Revilot, Clinton temporarily lost the rights to the name "The Parliaments", and signed the ensemble to [[Westbound Records]] as [[Funkadelic]], which Clinton positioned as a funk-rock band featuring the five touring musicians with the five Parliaments singers as uncredited guests. With Funkadelic as a recording and touring entity in its own right, in 1970 Clinton relaunched the singing group, now known as Parliament, at first featuring the same ten members. Clinton was now the leader of two different acts, Parliament and Funkadelic, which featured the same members but were marketed as creating two different types of [[funk]].

The Parliament album entitled \'\'[[Osmium (album)|Osmium]]\'\' was released on [[Invictus Records]] in 1970, and was later reissued on CD with non-album tracks as both \'\'[[Rhenium (album)|Rhenium]]\'\' and \'\'[[First Thangs]]\'\'. \'\'Osmium\'\' featured a mostly [[psychedelic soul]] sound that was more similar to the Funkadelic albums of the period than to the later Parliament albums. The song "The Breakdown" was released separately as a single, and reached #30 on the R&B charts in 1971. Due to continuing contractual problems and the fact that Funkadelic releases were more successful at the time, Clinton abandoned the name Parliament until 1974.

Following \'\'Osmium\'\', the lineup of Parliament-Funkadelic began going through many changes and was expanded significantly, with the addition of important members such as keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] in 1970, singer/guitarist [[Garry Shider]] in 1971, and bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] (recruited from the [[James Brown]] backing band) in 1972. Dozens of singers and musicians would contribute to future Parliament-Funkadelic releases. Clinton relaunched Parliament in 1974 and signed the act to [[Casablanca Records]]. Parliament, now augmented by the [[Horny Horns]] (also recruited from [[James Brown]]\'s band) was positioned as a smoother R&B-based funk ensemble with intricate horn and vocal arrangements, and as a counterpoint to the guitar-based funk-rock of Funkadelic. By this point, Parliament and Funkadelic were touring as a combined entity known as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] or simply [[List of P-Funk members|P-Funk]] (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton\'s rapidly growing stable of funk artists).

The album \'\'[[Up for the Down Stroke]]\'\' was released in 1974, with \'\'[[Chocolate City (album)|Chocolate City]]\'\' following in 1975. Both performed strongly on the \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\' R&B charts and were moderately successful on the Pop charts. Parliament began its period of greatest mainstream success with the concept album \'\'[[Mothership Connection]]\'\' (1975), the lyrics of which launched much of the [[P-Funk mythology]]. The subsequent albums \'\'[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]\'\' (1976), \'\'[[Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]\'\' (1977), and \'\'[[Motor Booty Affair]]\'\' (1978) all reached high on both the R&B and Pop charts, while Funkadelic was also experiencing significant mainstream success. Parliament scored the #1 R&B singles "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]" in 1977 and "[[Aqua Boogie]]" in 1978.

The rapidly expanding ensemble of musicians and singers in the [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] enterprise, as well as Clinton\'s problematic management practices, began to take their toll by the late 1970s. Original Parliaments members [[Fuzzy Haskins]], [[Calvin Simon]], and [[Grady Thomas]], who had been with Clinton since the barbershop days in the late 1950s, felt marginalized by the continuous influx of new members and departed acrimoniously in 1977. Other important group members like singer/guitarist [[Glenn Goins]] and drummer [[Jerome Brailey]] left Parliament-Funkadelic in the late 1970s after disputes over Clinton\'s management. Two further Parliament albums, \'\'[[Gloryhallastoopid]]\'\' (1979) and \'\'[[Trombipulation]]\'\' (1980) were less successful than the albums from the group\'s prime 1975-1978 period.

In the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at [[Casablanca Records]], George Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars. The [[Parliament-Funkadelic|P-Funk All-Stars]] continued to record and tour into the 1990s and 2000s, and regularly perform classic Parliament songs.

Quincy was introduced to music by his mother, who always sang religious songs, and by his next door neighbor Lucy Jackson. When he was five or six, Jackson played stride piano next door, and he would always listen through the walls. Lucy Jackson recalled that after he heard her that one day, she could not get him off her piano if she tried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/quincy-jones/the-story-of-an-american-musician/636/|title=Quincy Jones: The Story of an American Musician|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

At the age of 14, Jones introduced himself to a 16-year-old musician from Florida [[Ray Charles]] after watching him play at the Black Elks Club. Jones cites Ray Charles as an early inspiration for his own music career. He noted that Charles overcame a disability to achieve his musical goals. He has credited his father\'s sturdy work ethic with giving him the means to proceed, and his loving strength with holding the family together. Jones has said his father had a saying: "Once a task is just begun, never leave until it\'s done. Be the labor great or small, do it well or not at all."<ref name="Catholic"/>

In 1951, Jones won a scholarship to [[Seattle University]], where a young [[Clint Eastwood]]\xe2\x80\x94also a music major there\xe2\x80\x94watched him play in the college band. After only one semester, Jones transferred to what is now the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston on another scholarship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Quincy Jones: Seattle\'s Own Music Man|url=http://northwestprimetime.com/news/2013/sep/01/quincy-jones/|accessdate=July 8, 2014|publisher=Northwest Prime Time|date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> While studying at Berklee he played at [[Izzy Ort\'s Bar & Grille]] with Bunny Campbell and Preston Sandiford, whom he later cited as important musical influences.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feist|first1=Jonathan|title=Masters of Music: Conversations with Berklee Greats|date=1999|publisher=Berklee Press|isbn=9780634006425|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nrM5F_9kboC&pg=PA177}}</ref> He left his studies after he received an offer to tour as a trumpeter with the bandleader [[Lionel Hampton]] and embarked on his professional career. While Jones was on the road with Hampton, he displayed a gift for arranging songs. Jones relocated to New York City, where he received a number of freelance commissions arranging songs for artists including [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Count Basie]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Gene Krupa]], and Ray Charles, by now a close friend.

==Musical career==
At the age of 19, Jones traveled with [[Lionel Hampton]] to Europe and said it turned him upside down, altering his view of racism in the US.  
<blockquote>"It gave you some sense of perspective of past, present and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States and put it on another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul, it opened my mind."<ref name="Achievement"/></blockquote>

In 1956, Jones toured again as a trumpeter and musical director of the [[Dizzy Gillespie]] Band on a tour of the Middle East and South America sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency]]. Upon his return, Jones signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount Records]] and started his recording career as the leader of his own band. In 1957, Quincy settled in Paris, where he studied composition and theory with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and composer [[Olivier Messiaen]]. He also performed at the [[Paris Olympia]]. Jones became music director at Barclay Disques, a leading French record company and the licensee for [[Mercury Records]] in France.

During the 1950s, Jones successfully toured throughout Europe with a number of jazz orchestras. As musical director of [[Harold Arlen]]\'s jazz musical \'\'Free and Easy\'\', Quincy Jones took to the road again. A European tour closed in Paris in February 1960. With musicians from the Arlen show, Jones formed his own big band, called The Jones Boys, with eighteen artists. The band included double bass player [[Eddie Jones (jazz musician)|Eddie Jones]] and fellow trumpeter [[Reunald Jones]], and organized a tour of North America and Europe. Though the European and American concerts met enthusiastic audiences and sparkling reviews, concert earnings could not support a band of this size. Poor budget planning resulted in an economic disaster; the band dissolved and the fallout left Jones in a financial crisis. Quoted in [[Musician (magazine)|\'\'Musician\'\']] magazine, Jones said about the ordeal, 
<blockquote>"We had the best jazz band in the planet, and yet we were literally starving. That\'s when I discovered that there was \'\'music\'\', and there was the \'\'music business\'\'. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two."</blockquote>[[Irving Green]], head of [[Mercury Records]], helped Jones with a personal loan<ref>Jones, Quincy.

Retrieved July 26, 2013</ref> and a new job as the musical director of the company\'s New York division. There he worked with [[Doug Moody]], who founded [[Mystic Records]].

===1960s breakthrough and rise to prominence===
In 1964, Jones was promoted to vice-president of Mercury Records, becoming the first African American to hold this executive position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102315/ |title=Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones (1990)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> In that same year, he turned his attention to film scores, another musical arena long closed to African Americans. At the invitation of director [[Sidney Lumet]], he composed the music for \'\'[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]\'\' (1964). It was the first of his 33 major motion picture scores.

Following the success of \'\'The Pawnbroker\'\', Jones left Mercury Records and moved to Los Angeles. After composing a [[film score]] for \'\'[[The Slender Thread]]\'\' (1965), starring [[Sidney Poitier]], he was in constant demand as a composer. His film credits in the next five years included \'\'[[Walk, Don\'t Run]]\'\' (1966), \'\'[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]\'\' (1967), \'\'[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]\'\', \'\'[[A Dandy in Aspic]]\'\' (both 1968), \'\'[[Mackenna\'s Gold]]\'\', \'\'[[The Italian Job]]\'\', \'\'[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]\'\', \'\'[[The Lost Man]]\'\', \'\'[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]\'\' (all 1969), and \'\'[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]\'\' (1972). In addition, he composed "[[Sanford and Son Theme (The Streetbeater)|The Streetbeater]]," which became familiar as the theme music for the television sitcom \'\'[[Sanford and Son]]\'\', starring close friend [[Redd Foxx]]; he also composed the themes for other TV shows, including \'\'[[The Bill Cosby Show]]\'\', \'\'[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]\'\', \'\'[[Banacek]]\'\', and the [[Mark Goodson|Goodson & Todman]] game show\'\' [[Now You See It (U.S. game show)|Now You See It]]\'\'.

In the 1960s, Jones worked as an arranger for some of the most important artists of the era, including [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Shirley Horn]], [[Peggy Lee]], and [[Dinah Washington]]. Jones\'s solo recordings also gained acclaim, including \'\'[[Walking in Space]]\'\', \'\'[[Gula Matari]]\'\', \'\'[[Smackwater Jack]]\'\', \'\'[[You\'ve Got It Bad, Girl]]\'\', \'\'[[Body Heat (Quincy Jones album)|Body Heat]]\'\', \'\'[[Mellow Madness]]\'\', and \'\'I Heard That!!\'\'.

He is known for his 1962 tune "[[Soul Bossa Nova]]", which originated on the \'\'[[Big Band Bossa Nova]]\'\' album. "Soul Bossa Nova" was a theme used for the 1998 World Cup{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, the Canadian game show [[Definition (TV series)|\'\'Definition\'\']], the [[Woody Allen]] film \'\'[[Take the Money and Run]],\'\' and the \'\'[[Austin Powers (series)|Austin Powers]]\'\' film series. It was sampled by Canadian hip hop group [[Dream Warriors]] for their song, "My Definition of a Boombastic Jazz Style".

Jones produced all four million-selling singles for [[Lesley Gore]] during the early and mid-sixties, including "[[It\'s My Party (Lesley Gore song)|It\'s My Party]]" (UK No.&nbsp;8; US No.&nbsp;1), "[[Judy\'s Turn to Cry]]" (US No.&nbsp;5), "[[She\'s a Fool]]" (also a US No.&nbsp;5) in 1963, and "[[You Don\'t Own Me]]" (US No.&nbsp;2 for four weeks in 1964). He continued to produce for Gore until 1966, including the [[Ellie Greenwich|Greenwich]]/ [[Jeff Barry|Barry]] hit "[[Look of Love (Lesley Gore song)|Look of Love]]" (US No.&nbsp;27) in 1965.

In 1975, Jones founded Qwest Productions, for which he arranged and produced hugely successful albums by Frank Sinatra and other major pop figures. In 1978, he produced the soundtrack for \'\'[[The Wiz]]\'\', the musical adaptation of \'\'[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\'\', starring Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. In 1982, Jones\' produced Michael Jackson\'s all-time best-selling album \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/quincy-jones-9357524?page=1|title=Quincy Jones|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

Jones\'s 1981 album, \'\'[[The Dude (Quincy Jones album)|The Dude]],\'\' yielded multiple hit singles, including "[[Ai No Corrida (song)|Ai No Corrida]]" (a remake of a song by [[Chaz Jankel]]), "Just Once," and "One Hundred Ways", the latter two featuring [[James Ingram]] on lead vocals and marking Ingram\'s first hits.

In 1985, Jones wrote the score for the [[Steven Spielberg]] film adaptation of the Pulitzer-prize winning epistolary novel, \'\'[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],\'\' by Alice Walker. He and [[Jerry Goldsmith]] (from \'\'[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]\'\') are the only composers besides [[John Williams]] to have scored a Spielberg theatrical film. After the 1985 [[American Music Awards]] ceremony, Jones used his influence to draw most of the major American recording artists of the day into a studio to record the song "[[We Are the World]]" to raise money for the victims of [[Ethiopia]]\'s famine. When people marveled at his ability to make the collaboration work, Jones explained that he\'d taped a simple sign on the entrance: "Check Your Ego At The Door".

In 1988, Quincy Jones Productions joined forces with Warner Communications to create Quincy Jones Entertainment. He signed a ten-picture deal with [[Warner Brothers]] and signed a two-series deal with NBC Productions. The television show \'\'[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]\'\' was completed in 1990, but producers of \'\'[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]\'\' (from UPN) later rejected its early concept stages. Jones produced the highly successful \'\'Fresh Prince of Bel Air\'\' (discovering [[Will Smith]]); UPN\'s \'\'In the House,\'\' and FOX\'s \'\'[[Madtv]]\'\'\xe2\x80\x94which did 14 seasons on Fox.<ref name="http://www.quincyjones.com/about">{{cite web|url=http://www.quincyjones.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Quincy Jones |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Jones started a huge, ongoing project called "The Evolution of Black Music." Not only did the Quincy Jones Entertainment Company produce \'\'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\'\', but it also started a weekly talk show with his friend, Reverend Jesse Jackson, as the host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Jo-Ki/Jones-Quincy.html|title=Quincy Jones|publisher=Notablebiographies.com|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

Starting in the late 1970s, Jones tried to convince [[Miles Davis]] to revive the music he had recorded on several classic albums of the 1960s, which had been arranged by [[Gil Evans]]. Davis had always refused, citing a desire not to revisit the past. In 1991, Davis, then suffering from [[pneumonia]], relented and agreed to perform the music at a concert at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. The resulting album from the recording, \'\'[[Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux]]\'\', was Davis\' last released album (he died several months afterward). It is considered an artistic triumph.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thigpen |first=David E. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979336,00.html |title=The Last Great Set |publisher=TIME |date=October 4, 1993 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 1993, Jones collaborated with [[David Salzman]] to produce the concert extravaganza, \'\'An American Reunion\'\', a celebration of [[Bill Clinton]]\'s inauguration as president of the United States. The same year, Jones joined forces with Salzman and renamed his company as Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment (QDE). QDE is a diverse company that produces media technology, motion pictures, television programs (\'\'[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]\'\', \'\'[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]\'\', and \'\'[[MADtv]]\'\'), and magazines (\'\'[[VIBE]]\'\' and \'\'[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]\'\').

In 2001, Jones published his autobiography, \'\'Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones\'\'. On July 31, 2007, he partnered with Wizzard Media to launch the Quincy Jones Video Podcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quincyjones.com/ |title= Quincy Jones|publisher=quincyjones.com|date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref> In each episode, Jones shares his knowledge and experience in the music industry. The first episode features him in the studio, producing "I Knew I Loved you" for [[Celine Dion]]. This is featured on the [[Ennio Morricone]] [[tribute album]], \'\'[[We All Love Ennio Morricone]]\'\'. Jones is also noted for helping produce [[Anita Hall]]\'s CD, \'\'Send Love\'\', which was released in 2009.

===Work with Michael Jackson===
While working on the film \'\'[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]\'\', [[Michael Jackson]] asked Jones to recommend some producers for his upcoming solo record. Jones offered some names, but eventually offered to produce the record. Jackson accepted and the resulting record, \'\'[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off The Wall]]\'\', ultimately sold about 20 million copies. This made Jones the most powerful record producer in the industry at that time. Jones\' and Jackson\'s next collaboration, \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]],\'\' has sold a reputed 110 million copies and has become the highest-selling album of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/china/learningenglish/specials/1430_jackson_photo/page7.shtml |title=BBC China &#124; Michael Jackson Photo Gallery \xe8\xbf\x88\xe5\x85\x8b\xe2\x80\xa2\xe6\x9d\xb0\xe5\x85\x8b\xe9\x80\x8a\xe5\xbd\xb1\xe9\x9b\x86 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> Jones also worked on Jackson\'s album \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\', which has sold 45 million copies.  \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\' was the last time the pair worked together in the studio. Audio interviews with Jones are featured on the 2001 special editions of \'\'[[Off the Wall (Michael Jackson album)|Off The Wall]]\'\', \'\'[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]],\'\' and  \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\'.

In a 2002 interview, when asked if he would work with Jones again, Jackson suggested he might. But, in 2007, when Jones was asked by [[NME]], he said "Man, please! We already did that. I have talked to him about working with him again but I\'ve got too much to do. I\'ve got 900 products, I\'m 74 years old."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/28551 |title=Quincy Jones snubs chance to team up with Michael Jackson , News , NME.COM |work=NME |location=UK <! |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

Following Jackson\'s death on June 25, 2009, Jones said:
{{cquote|I am absolutely devastated at this tragic and unexpected news. For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age, I just don\'t have the words. Divinity brought our souls together on \'\'The Wiz\'\' and allowed us to do what we were able to throughout the \'80s. To this day, the music we created together on \'\'Off The Wall\'\', \'\'Thriller\'\' and \'\'Bad\'\' is played in every corner of the world and the reason for that is because he had it all...talent, grace, professionalism and dedication. He was the consummate entertainer and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever. I\'ve lost my little brother today, and part of my soul has gone with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/06/michael_jackson_rushed_to_hosp.html |title=Michael Jackson Dead at 50 |author=James, Frank |date=June 25, 2009 |work=The Two-Way |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}</ref>}}

In October 2013, it was reported by the [[BBC]] and \'\'[[Hollywood Reporter]]\'\' that Jones is suing the estate of Michael Jackson for 10 million dollars. Jones says that MJJ Productions, a song company managed by the singer\'s estate and Sony Music Entertainment, improperly re-edited songs to deprive him of royalties and production fees; further, they broke an agreement giving him the right to remix master recordings for albums released after Jackson\'s death in 2009.<ref name="stone"/> The songs Quincy produced for Jackson were used in the film, \'\'[[Michael Jackson\'s This Is It|This Is It]].\'\' Jones is filing lawsuits against the works of Michael Jackson [[Cirque du Soleil]] productions, and the 25th anniversary edition of the \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\' album.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/quincy-jones-files-10m-lawsuit-651045 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Eriq | last=Gardner | title=Quincy Jones Files $10M Lawsuit Over Michael Jackson Music (Exclusive) | date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Quincy believes he should have received a producer credit in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/quincy-jones-sues-michael-jacksons-estate-20688189|title=Quincy Jones Sues Michael Jackson\'s Estate|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref> Quincy also claimed he had a bigger part in Jackson\'s music than everyone thought.<ref name="stone">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/quincy-jones-sues-michael-jackson-estate-20131026|title=Miriam Coleman, "Quincy Jones Sues Michael Jackson\'s Estate"|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24681875 |title=BBC News \xe2\x80\x93 US music producer Quincy Jones sues Jackson estate |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=October 26, 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref>

==Personal life==
With the help of the author [[Alex Haley]] in 1972 and Mormon researchers in [[Salt Lake City]], Jones discovered that his mother\'s ancestors included James Lanier, a relative of [[Sidney Lanier]], the poet. Jones said in an interview, "He had a baby with my great-grandmother [a slave], and my grandmother was born there [on a plantation in Kentucky]. We traced this all the way back to the Laniers, same family as [[Tennessee Williams]]."<ref name="Achievement"/> Learning that the Lanier immigrant ancestors were [[French Huguenot]] refugees, who had court musicians among their ancestors, Jones attributed some of his musicianship to them.<ref name="Achievement"/> In a 2009 [[BBC]] interview, Jones said Haley also helped him learn that his father was of half [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/8132889.stm |title=Quincy Jones on his Welsh roots |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=July 4, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

In 1974, he suffered a life-threatening brain [[aneurysm]], so he decided to cut back on his schedule to spend time with his friends and family.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/quincy-jones-mn0000378624/biography|title=Quincy Jones|work=AllMusic|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref> Since his family and friends believed that his life was coming to an end, they started to plan a memorial service for him.  He attended his own service with his neurologist by his side in case the excitement overwhelmed him. Some of the singers in his service were Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughn and Sidney Poitier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/24191/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-quincy-jones|title=5 Things You Didn\'t Know about Quincy Jones|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

For the 2006 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television program, \'\'[[African American Lives]],\'\' Jones had his DNA tested and genealogists researched his family history again. His DNA admixture revealed he is predominately African with 34% European in ancestry, found on both sides of his family. Research showed that he has Welsh, English, French and Italian ancestry, with European ancestry in his direct patrilineal line ([[Y-chromosome DNA|Y DNA]]). Through his direct matrilineal line ([[Mitochondrial DNA|mt DNA]]), he is of West African/Central African ancestry of [[Tikar]] descent, a people centered in present-day [[Cameroon]] and known for their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitzambia.co.zm/eng/news/news/zambia_tourism_news_archives/new_dna_test_results_trace_oprah_winfrey_s_ancestry_to_liberia_zambia |title=New DNA test results trace Oprah Winfrey\'s ancestry to Liberia / Zambia : Zambia News |publisher=Zambia News |date=February 6, 2006}}</ref> Other matrilineal ancestry includes European, such as Lanier male ancestors who fought for the Confederacy, making him eligible for [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]].

Jones has never learned to drive, citing an accident in which he was a passenger (at age 14) as the reason.<ref>{{cite news|last=Callaway |first=Sue |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/02/05/8399176/index.htm?section=money_mostpopular |title=Fortune test drives a Mercedes Maybach with Quincy Jones&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 February 5, 2007 |publisher=CNN  |date=January 28, 2007 |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

==Social activism==
[[File:QuincyJonesDec10.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Jones at a performance of The Hot Chocolate Nutcracker, December 2010]]
Jones\'s social activism began in the 1960s with his support of Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr]]. Jones is one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music (IBAM), whose events aim to raise enough funds for the creation of a national library of African-American art and music. Jones is also one of the founders of the \'\'Black Arts Festival\'\' in his hometown of Chicago. In the 1970s Jones formed The Quincy Jones Workshops. Meeting at the Los Angeles Landmark Variety Arts Center, the workshops educated and honed the skills of inner city youth in musicianship, acting and songwriting. Among its Alumni were Alton Mc Clain who had a hit song with Alton Mc Clain and Destiny, and [[Mark Wilkins]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2013}}, who co-wrote the hit song "Havin\' A Love Attack" with Mandrill, and went on to become the National Promotion Director for Punk / Thrash record label [[Mystic Records]].

For many years, Jones has worked closely with [[Bono]] of [[U2]] on a number of philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder of the \'\'Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation\'\'. A nonprofit organization that built more than 100 homes in South Africa which aims to connect youths with technology, education, culture and music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/quincy-jones-9357524 |title=Quincy Jones Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> One of the organization\'s programs is an intercultural exchange between underprivileged youths from Los Angeles and South Africa.

In 2004, Jones helped launch the We Are the Future (WAF) project, which gives children in poor and conflict-ridden areas a chance to live their childhoods and develop a sense of hope. The program is the result of a strategic partnership between the [[Global Forum]], the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation, and Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], UN agencies and major companies. The project was launched with a concert in Rome, Italy, in front of an audience of half a million people.

Jones supports a number of other charities including the [[NAACP]], [[GLAAD]], Peace Games, [[AmfAR]] and [[Maybach Foundation|The Maybach Foundation]].<ref name="quincy jones urbiz">{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5dai0Xest |title=Maybach Family Foundation |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2014-05-23}}</ref> Jones serves on the Advisory Board of [[HealthCorps]]. On July 26, 2007, he announced his endorsement of [[Hillary Clinton]] for president. But with the election of [[Barack Obama]], Quincy Jones said that his next conversation "with President Obama [will be] to beg for a secretary of arts,"<ref>John Schaefer interview with Quincy Jones on \'\'Soundcheck\'\', November 14, 2008</ref> This prompted the circulation of a petition on the Internet asking Obama to create such a Cabinet-level position in his administration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Suzanne |url=http://philanthropy.com/news/government/6407/online-petition-asks-obama-to-create-secretary-of-the-arts-position |title=Online Petition Asks Obama to Create Secretary of the Arts Position |work=The Chronicle of Philanthropy |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/should-us-have-minister-of-the-arts/ |title=Should US have a Minister of the Arts |work = Deadline Hollywood Daily |accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

Jones and his friend [[John J. Sie|John Sie]], founder of [[Starz Entertainment|Liberty Starz]], worked together to create the [http://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/ Global Down Syndrome Foundation].

\'\'\'Dayton\'\'\' was a [[post-disco]] [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]], formed in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]] by Chris Jones ([[trumpet]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[human voice|vocals]]) from the band [[Sun (R&B band)|Sun]] and Shawn Sandridge ([[guitar]], vocals) from Over Night Low.  Derrick Armstrong (vocals), Kevin Hurt ([[drum]]s, [[percussion instrument|percussion]]), Jennifer Matthews (vocals) and Rachel Beavers (vocals) completed the line up.  Former Sun member Dean Hummons played the keyboards on the first two Dayton [[album]]s.

==History==
The group signed to [[Liberty Records]] in 1980 and released their self-titled debut album which included the track "Eyes On You".  Dayton [[concert tour|toured]] with [[Ashford & Simpson]], [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Stephanie Mills]].  They [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a second Liberty album, \'\'Cutie Pie\'\', in 1981. Guest musicians included James "Diamond" Williams, Keith Harrison, Clarence "Chet" Willis, [[Billy Beck]], Wes Boatman and Vincent Andrews.

The group switched to [[Capitol Records]] in 1982 and delivered the successful album \'\'Hot Fun\'\'. This record included "Krackity-Krack" with a guest appearance by [[Bootsy Collins]] and their hit [[cover version]] of [[Sly Stone|Sly Stone\'s]] "[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]." 

Dayton introduced [[List of disco artists (L-R)|Rahni Harris]] as vocalist/keyboard player on their third album, \'\'Feel The Music\'\' in 1983, which included "The Sound Of Music". "The Sound of Music" recorded on Capitol (CL318) Records was their best known track in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it reached #75 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] for one week in late 1983.  It became very popular in nightclubs throughout the UK. <ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

They released their last album \'\'This Time\'\' in 1985, also produced by Harris. The single "You Should Be Dancin\'" was released from this LP (the last track on side 2) but failed to chart in the UK.  The album did not match their previous efforts and marked the end of Dayton.

\'\'\'Raydio\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[human voice|vocal]] [[musical ensemble|group]] formed in 1977, by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]], with Vincent Bohnam, [[Jerry Knight]], and Arnell Carmichael.

==Career==

===1970s and Raydio===
After securing a record deal, the group scored their first big [[hit record|hit]] in early 1978 with "[[Jack And Jill (Raydio song)|Jack And Jill]]", which was taken from their self-titled debut [[album]]. The song peaked at #8 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]], and reached #11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"Is This a Love Thing" peaked at #27 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in August 1978.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Their next successful follow-up hit, "[[You Can\'t Change That]]" was released in 1979, and lifted from their \'\'Rock On\'\' album. The single made it up to #9 on the Billboard chart that year. In September 1979 they participated in an anti-nuclear concert at Madison Square Garden. Their performance of "[[You Can\'t Change That]]" at this show appears on the \'\'No Nukes\'\' album.

===The 1980s and "Ray Parker, Jr. and Raydio"===
By late 1980, the group had become known as Ray Parker Jr. and Raydio, and they released two more albums: \'\'Two Places at the Same Time\'\' (1980), and \'\'A Woman Needs Love\'\' (1981). These spawned another two [[Top 40]] single hits ("Two Places at the Same Time" - #40 in 1980; and "That Old Song" - #21 in 1981). Their last, and biggest hit, "[[A Woman Needs Love]]," was also released in 1981, and went to #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

After acknowledging the band had come to a crossroads, and with Parker wanting to go solo, they quietly broke up in 1981.

===Solo careers===
Parker then started his solo career, scoring six Top 40 hits throughout the 1980s, including the hit singles "The Other Woman" (Pop #4), and "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]". The latter song was the [[wikt:en:title track|title track]] of the [[box office]] hit [[film|movie]] \'\'[[Ghostbusters]]\'\'. The single went to #1 for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984.

Knight went on to have a moderately successful solo career of his own, later forming [[Ollie & Jerry]], with [[Ollie E. Brown]] (who had been a session drummer on all of Raydio\'s albums) in the mid-1980s. Their two biggest hits also came from soundtracks - "[[Breakin\'... There\'s No Stopping Us]]" was the theme to the [[motion picture]] \'\'[[Breakin\']]\'\', and hit #9 on the Hot 100 and #1 on the [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. Their second single "[[Electric Boogaloo (song)|Electric Boogaloo]]" (from the movie \'\'[[Breakin\' 2: Electric Boogaloo]]\'\'), did not enter the Hot 100, but did climb to #43 on the Dance charts.

\'\'\'Rick James\'\'\' (born \'\'\'James Ambrose Johnson, Jr.;\'\'\' February 1, 1948{{spaced ndash}}August 6, 2004) was an American musician and composer.

Influenced by singers such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Smokey Robinson]], James started singing in doo-wop and R&B groups as a teenager in his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]]. After entering the [[U.S. Navy]] to avoid [[conscription|getting drafted]], he [[desertion|deserted]] to [[Toronto]], where he formed the fusion band [[Mynah Birds|The Mynah Birds]], whose lineup once included [[Bruce Palmer]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Nick St. Nicholas]]. James\' tenure with the group was interrupted after he was discovered recording with the group in [[Motown]] in 1966. Surrendering to military authorities, he served a one-year prison term. Upon release, James moved to California to resume his duties with the Mynah Birds, although the group eventually split. James began a series of rock bands in California  and worked with Motown under the assumed name "Ricky Matthews" as a songwriter.

In 1977, he signed with the Gordy Records imprint of Motown as a recording artist, releasing his debut, \'\'[[Come Get It!]]\'\', in April 1978. The album sold over two million copies and launched his career into the mainstream as a [[funk]] and soul artist. His most popular album, 1981\'s \'\'[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]\'\', launched him into superstardom thanks to the hit singles, "[[Give It to Me Baby]]" and "[[Super Freak]]", the latter song becoming his [[signature song]] for the rest of his life, and the basis of [[MC Hammer]]\'s biggest hit, "[[U Can\'t Touch This]]"; James eventually sued for back royalties. After being credited as writer of the song, James became the [[Grammy Awards of 1990|1990 recipient of a Best R&B Song Grammy]] for composing the song. Due to this success, James was often called [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|the "king of punk funk"]], for his mix of funk, soul and underground-inspired rock music. In addition to his own success, James emerged as a successful songwriter and producer for other artists, such as [[Teena Marie]], [[Mary Jane Girls|The Mary Jane Girls]], [[The Temptations]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Smokey Robinson]].

An addiction to [[crack cocaine|crack]] hampered his career by the late 1980s. In the 1990s, his legal troubles, which included assaulting two women while under the influence of crack, led him to serve a three-year sentence at California\'s [[Folsom State Prison]]. James was released on parole in 1996 and resumed his musical career releasing the album, \'\'[[Urban Rapsody]],\'\' in 1997. A mild stroke suffered during a concert in early 1998 interrupted his career for a brief time. James received new notoriety in 2004 when he appeared on an episode of [[Dave Chappelle]]\'s \'\'[[Chappelle Show]]\'\' in the [[Charlie Murphy]] "True Hollywood Stories" segment of the show, in which James\' past wild lifestyle was satirized. James died later that year from heart failure at the age of 56.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
\'\'\'James Ambrose Johnson, Jr.\'\'\' was born on February 1, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, to Mabel (n\xc3\xa9e Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson, Sr. He was one of eight children.

James was introduced to drugs at an early age and, as a young teen, was busted for burglary.<ref name="glowreview" /> Due to his stints in jail for theft, James entered the United States Navy at 14 or 15, lying about his age, to avoid the draft. During that time, he also became a drummer for local jazz groups in  New York City.<ref name="glowreview" /> Due to him missing his twice-monthly Reserve sessions at the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS \'\'Enterprise\'\']], he found himself ordered to Vietnam.<ref name="glowreview" />

In 1965, he fled for Toronto, where he made friendships with then-local musicians [[Neil Young]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].<ref name="glowreview" /> To avoid being caught by military authorities, James went under the assumed name, "Ricky James Matthews".<ref name="glowreview" /> That same year, James formed the Mynah Birds, a band that produced a fusion of soul, folk and rock music. In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of [[Columbia Records]], releasing the single, "Mynah Bird Hop"/"Mynah Bird Song". At one point, [[Nick St. Nicholas]] of later [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] fame was a member; eventually bassist [[Bruce Palmer]] replaced him by the time "Mynah Bird Hop" was recorded. James and Palmer would recruit guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to Detroit to record with [[Motown]]. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label\'s attitude towards the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, Marvin Gaye and [[Stevie Wonder]]. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name "Ricky James Matthews" was "too long", and instead told James to shorten it to "Ricky James".<ref name="glowreview" />

After James got involved in a fight with the group\'s financial backer in Toronto, the man alerted the Navy of James\' whereabouts and the singer was soon arrested.<ref name="glowreview" /> Afterwards, Motown dropped the band from the label, and James spent a year in prison.<ref name="glowreview" /> After his release, James moved to California where he resumed his musical career. After forming a duo with musician [[Greg Reeves (musician)|Greg Reeves]], Reeves was soon hired to work as a musician for the rock supergroup, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].<ref name="glowreview" /> James returned to Motown as a songwriter in 1968, under the assumed name "Rickie Matthews", and worked with acts such as [[The Miracles]], [[Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]]. According to James, he briefly got involved in [[procuring (prostitution)|pimp activity]] during this time, but stopped because he felt he wasn\'t qualified for it due to the harsh activity and the abuse of women there.<ref name="glowreview" /> Returning to California from Toronto in 1969, James got involved with [[hair stylist]] [[Jay Sebring]], who agreed to invest in James\' music.<ref name="glowreview" /> One night, Sebring invited James and his girlfriend to a party hosted by Sebring\'s friend [[Sharon Tate]].<ref name="glowreview" /> James claimed a "horrible hangover" forced him to cancel his visit to the house. That night, Sebring, Tate and their other guests were [[Charles Manson#Tate murders|murdered]] by members of [[Charles Manson]]\'s [[Manson Family|family]].<ref name="glowreview" />

In late 1968, James formed the rock band Salt and Pepper.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sandiegoaccountantsguide.com/library/Rick-James.php | title=Rick James Multimedia Information | accessdate=July 17, 2008}}</ref> James and S&P member Ed Roth later were included in Bruce Palmer\'s solo album \'\'The Cycle is Complete\'\'. The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded an album for Los Angeles label, Lion Records, in 1972, though it was later shelved. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards. In 1973, James signed with [[A&M Records]], where his first single under the name Rick James, "My Mama", was released, becoming a club hit in Europe.<ref name="glowreview" /> In 1976, James returned to Buffalo, New York, and formed the [[Stone City Band]] and recorded the song "Get Up and Dance!", which was his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown\'s Gordy Records imprint, where they began recording their first album in New York City.

===Solo career===
In April 1978, James released his debut solo album, \'\'[[Come Get It!]]\'\', which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, "[[You and I (Rick James song)|You and I]]", which became his first number-one R&B hit. The album also included the hit single, "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]". It eventually sold two million copies, launching James\' musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled. In early 1979, James\' second album, \'\'[[Bustin\' Out of L Seven]]\'\', followed the previous album\'s success, eventually selling a million copies. A third album, \'\'[[Fire It Up (Rick James album)|Fire It Up]]\'\', was released in late 1979 going gold. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], as well as singer [[Teena Marie]], as his opening act.<ref name="glowreview" /> James had produced Marie\'s successful Motown debut album, \'\'[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]\'\' and was featured on the hit duet, "I\'m a Sucker (For Your Love)". James was credited with naming Marie, "Lady Tee", on the song, a nickname that stuck with Marie for the rest of her career. The Fire It Up tour led to James developing a bitter rivalry with Prince, after he accused the musician for ripping off his act.<ref name="glowreview" />

Following the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy \'\'[[Garden of Love]]\'\', which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, \'\'[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]\'\', which like his previous four albums, was a [[concept album]]. \'\'Street Songs\'\' featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and [[new wave music|new wave]], as well as James\' brand of crossover funk, enabling James\' own style of "punk funk". The album featured hit singles such as "Ghetto Life", the Teena Marie duet "Fire and Desire", "[[Give It to Me Baby]]", and his biggest crossover hit to date, "[[Super Freak]]", which peaked at number sixteen on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and sold over a million copies. \'\'Street Songs\'\' peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over three million copies alone in the United States. Following up that success, James released two more gold albums, 1982\'s \'\'[[Throwin\' Down]]\'\' and 1983\'s \'\'[[Cold Blooded (Rick James album)|Cold Blooded]]\'\'.

During this period, envious of Prince\'s success as producer of other acts including [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and [[Vanity 6]], James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the [[Mary Jane Girls]], featuring his former background singer Joanne "JoJo" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, "[[All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls song)|All Night Long]]", "Candy Man", and "[[In My House]]". In 1982, James produced the Temptations\' top 10 R&B hit, "Standing on the Top". In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, "Ebony Eyes", with singer [[Smokey Robinson]]. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer [[Eddie Murphy]] with the song "[[Party All The Time]]".  That same year he appeared on an episode of The A-Team with Isaac Hayes.  After the release of his ninth solo album, \'\'[[The Flag (album)|The Flag]]\'\', in 1986, James signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which released the album \'\'[[Wonderful (Rick James album)|Wonderful]]\'\' in 1988, featuring the hit, "Loosey\'s Rap".

James\' controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. During his heyday, James had presented his songs to the then-fledging music video channel, [[MTV]], only to be turned down because James\' music didn\'t fit the network\'s rock playlist. James accused the network of racism.{{sfn|Denisof|1988|pp=69\xe2\x80\x9371}} When MTV and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] both avoided playing the video for "Loosey\'s Rap" because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cher]].

In 1989, James\' eleventh album, \'\'[[Kickin\']]\'\', was issued only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Warner Bros. and James began struggling with personal and legal problems. That year [[MC Hammer]] released his hit [[signature song]], "[[U Can\'t Touch This]]", which sampled the prominent opening riff from "[[Super Freak]]". James and his co-writer on "[[Super Freak]]", Alonzo Miller, successfully sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three consequently received the 1990 [[Grammy Award]] for Best R&B Song.{{sfn|James|2014|p=296}} In 1997, James released \'\'[[Urban Rapsody]]\'\', his first album since his release from prison on assault charges. James also went on the Urban Rapsody Tour that featured McDuffie. That same year, he discussed his life and career in interviews for the VH1 musical documentary series, \'\'[[Behind the Music]]\'\', which aired in early 1998. James\' musical career slowed again after he suffered a minor stroke during a concert. In 1999, James accepted an offer by Eddie Murphy himself to appear in his film, \'\'[[Life (1999 film)|Life]].\'\'{{sfn|James|2014|p=317}}

==Personal life==
James had three children. With Syville Morgan, a former singer and songwriter, he had daughter Ty and son Rick Jr. 

In 1989, James met 17-year-old party goer Tanya Hijazi. The two began a romance in 1990. In 1993, the couple welcomed the arrival of their only child and James\' youngest, Tazman. Following their releases from prison for their involvement in assaulting Mary Sauger and Frances Alley, the couple married in 1996. The couple\'s marriage dissolved in 2002. 

James was very close with [[Teena Marie]], whom he met in 1979 and began working with that same year. While James had denied that the two were romantically involved, Marie would say they were romantically involved and engaged "for two weeks." Their professional partnership lasted into 2004 when Marie released her comeback album, \'\'[[La Dona]],\'\' which included the James duet "I Got You." When James died, Marie said she struggled to come to terms with her loss.

James became close friends with [[Eddie Murphy]] after the two met in 1981. Following his exit from the [[United States Navy]] in 1984, Murphy\'s older brother [[Charlie Murphy]], whose first post-Navy job was working as security for his famous brother, began hanging out with James, bonding with the singer. Murphy would later recall on \'\'[[Chappelle\'s Show]]\'\' his sometimes strained relationship with James, which helped to revive James\' name in the public eye after years of seclusion following his mild stroke in 1998. James also appeared in the episode recounting his memory of the experiences shared by [[Charlie Murphy|Charlie]], such as starting impromptu fights with him and staining Eddie Murphy\'s couch with mud.

James was friends with fellow Motown acts [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]. James also befriended Gaye\'s second wife, Janis, and was godfather of Gaye\'s daughter [[Nona Gaye|Nona]]. Gaye was one of the singers James idolized as a teenager. James\' relationship with Robinson began shortly after James signed with Motown and, in 1983, the duo recorded the hit "Ebony Eyes." James also idolized former Temptations lead singer [[David Ruffin]] and his self-claimed uncle, bass vocalist [[Melvin Franklin]], and grabbed at the chance to produce the hit "Standing on the Top" for them in 1982. Before that, the then-current lineup of the group recorded background vocals on two James-associated projects \xe2\x80\x93 James\' \'\'[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]\'\' and Teena Marie\'s \'\'[[It Must Be Magic]],\'\' singing on "Ghetto Life" and "[[Super Freak]]" on the former, and the title track on the latter. In "Super Freak," "It Must Be Magic," and "Standing on the Top," James famously shouted out, \'\'"Temptations SING!"\'\'

James\' lifelong [[Substance dependence|drug abuse]] began in his teens, first with marijuana and heroin.<ref name="glowreview" /> James began using cocaine in the late 1960s. Cocaine use became an addiction for James by the 1980s, and he began [[freebasing]] by the end of the decade. James recalled smoking [[crack cocaine]] in his [[Beverly Hills]] mansion and often had aluminum foil on the windows to escape onlookers. His drug use led to health issues that impacted his life. In April 1984, he was hospitalized after being found unconscious in the middle of his house by a friend.<ref name=hospital>"Singer Rick James Admitted to Buffalo, N.Y. Hospital". \'\'[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]\'\'. April 30, 1984.</ref> James claimed he quit cocaine when he entered prison, although cocaine would later be found in James\' bloodstream following his autopsy.

===Legal problems===
The start of the 1990s brought with it a string of bizarre and sometimes horrific incidents for Rick James. His drug use was by this time public knowledge, as he was mainly addicted to [[cocaine]]; he later admitted to spending about US$7,000 per week on drugs for five years straight. In 1993, he and future wife Tanya Hijazi were accused of holding 24-year-old Frances Alley hostage for up to six days (accounts vary on how long she was actually held){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}, tying her up, forcing her to perform sexual acts, and burning her legs and abdomen with the hot end of a crack cocaine pipe during a week-long cocaine binge. In 1993, while out on bail for that earlier incident, James, under the influence of cocaine, assaulted music executive Mary Sauger at the [[Sunset Tower|St. James Club and Hotel]] in [[West Hollywood]]. Sauger claims she met James and Hijazi for a business meeting, but said the two then kidnapped and beat her over a 20-hour period.

He was found guilty of both offenses, but was cleared of a [[torture]] charge in the crack-pipe incident that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life. He served two years in [[Folsom Prison]], and lost US$2 million in a [[civil suit]] to one of the women. He was released in 1996.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.eonline.com/news/33502/rick-james-gets-out-of-jail-his-fianc-e-goes-in|title= Rick James Gets Out of Jail, His Fianc\xc3\xa9e Goes In |author= Marcus Errico |work=[[E!]] Online |date =  August 23, 1996 }}</ref> In 1998, James was accused of [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] a 26-year-old woman though charges were later dropped.

===Final years<!--I\'m Rick James bitch links here-->===
In early 2004, James was a part of a sketch on \'\'[[Chappelle\'s Show]]\'\' called "Charlie Murphy\'s True Hollywood Stories". He, along with [[Charlie Murphy]], recounted humorous stories of their experiences together during the early 1980s. During the sketch, Rick James\' character, played by [[Dave Chappelle]], utters the now famous catchphrase, "I\'m Rick James, bitch!" The sketches were punctuated by James, as himself, explaining his past behavior with the phrase, "Cocaine is a hell of a drug!"

At the time of his death, he was working on an autobiography, \'\'[[The Confessions of Rick James: Memoirs of a Super Freak]],\'\' as well as a new album. The book was finally published toward the end of 2007 by [[Colossus Books]]. It features a picture of his tombstone. ( David Ritz, who had been employed by James to work on the book with him, later said that this version did not truly reflect how the musician wanted it published. In 2014, Ritz published his own re-edited version entitled Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James.) He was also supporting Teena Marie\'s tour of her album \'\'La Do\xc3\xb1a,\'\' and toured with her in May 2004, playing with her at the [[KBLX]] Stone Soul Picnic, [[Pioneer Amphitheatre]], [[Hayward, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rick-james-performs-at-the-7th-annual-stone-soul-picnic-on-news-photo/51149124 |title=Rick James Performs at the 7Th Annual Stone Soul Picnic\xe2\x80\xa6 Nieuwsfoto\'s &#124; Getty Images Nederland &#124; 51149124 |publisher=Gettyimages.com |date=May 31, 2004 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>

==Death==
On the morning of August 6, 2004, James was found dead by his caretaker in his Los Angeles home. He had died from [[respiratory failure|pulmonary failure]] and [[cardiac failure]] with his various health conditions of [[diabetes]], stroke, a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]], and a heart attack. Through his autopsy, [[alprazolam]], [[diazepam]], [[bupropion]], [[citalopram]], [[hydrocodone]], [[digoxin]], [[chlorpheniramine]], [[methamphetamine]], and [[cocaine]] were found in his blood.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4D61739F93BA2575AC0A9629C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=ARTS BRIEFING: HIGHLIGHTS; Rick James Autopsy Results | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=September 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> However, the coroner stated that "none of the drugs or drug combinations were found to be at levels that were life-threatening in and of themselves".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4D61739F93BA2575AC0A9629C8B63# | work=The New York Times | title=ARTS BRIEFING: HIGHLIGHTS; Rick James Autopsy Results | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=September 18, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

James was buried at [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo|Forest Lawn Cemetery]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. His two-ton, jet black headstone is engraved with the following lyrics to an unreleased song: "I\'ve had it all, I\'ve done it all, I\'ve seen it all.

\'\'\'Rose Royce\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group. They are best known for several [[hit single]]s during the 1970s including "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]," "[[I Wanna Get Next to You]]," "[[I\'m Going Down (Rose Royce song)|I\'m Going Down]]", "[[Wishing on a Star]]", and "[[Love Don\'t Live Here Anymore]]".

==Career==
The [[Los Angeles]]-based group originally comprised Henry Garner (drums), Terral "Terry" Santiel (congas), Lequeint "Duke" Jobe (bass), Michael Moore (saxophone), Kenny Copeland (trumpet, lead vocals), Kenji Brown (guitar, lead vocals), Freddie Dunn (trumpet), and Victor Nix (keyboards).  The group began in the early 1970s, when members of several backup bands from the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] and [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] areas of Los Angeles united under the name Total Concept Unlimited. In 1973, this collective toured England and Japan behind Motown soul star [[Edwin Starr]].  Starr introduced them to [[Norman Whitfield]], [[Motown]]\'s \'psychedelic shaman\' who was responsible for bringing a progressive funk-rock slant to the company, via such productions as Starr\'s "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]", [[The Undisputed Truth]]\'s "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]" and [[The Temptations]]\' "[[Papa Was A Rolling Stone]]".<ref>Album notes by A. Scott Galloway, \'\'The Very Best of Rose Royce\'\', 2001, Warner Bros.</ref>

Whitfield, after a decade at Motown, wanted to start a company of his own. He took the T.C.U. [[Octet (music)|octet]] under his wing and signed them to his label.  The group, now called Magic Wand, began working with [[Yvonne Fair]] and became the studio and concert band for [[The Undisputed Truth]].  During a tour stop in Miami, Undisputed Truth leader Joe Harris stumbled upon a singer named Gwen Dickey, then a member of a local group called The Jewels. Harris informed Whitfield of his discovery and Dickey was flown to Los Angeles to audition. In Dickey, Whitfield found the ingredient he felt was missing in Magic Wand: a charismatic female singer. He gave her the stage name Rose Norwalt. The original band lineup, now complete, prepared their debut album.

During this time Whitfield was contacted by film director [[Michael Schultz]], fresh from the success of his first feature, \'\'[[Cooley High]]\'\'.  Schultz offered Whitfield the opportunity to score his next picture, \'\'[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]\'\'. Whitfield  would utilize the film to launch his new group, and began composing music based on script outlines. He and the band visited the film set, soaking up the atmosphere. This was one of the rare instances in Hollywood in which the music was composed concurrently with the picture instead of after the fact. In the spirit of the soundtrack, the band\'s name was changed one final time to \'Rose Royce\'.  The name not only referenced the movie\'s automotive theme, but it also placed Gwen "Rose" Dickey front and center. Further, it hinted at a touch of class the band strove to bring to 1970s soul-funk.<ref>A. Scott Galloway album notes \'\'The Very Best of Rose Royce\'\' 2001 Warner Bros</ref>

The movie \'\'Car Wash\'\' and the soundtrack were great successes, bringing the group national fame. Whitfield won the Best Music award at the Cannes Film Festival, and the album received the Grammy for Best Motion Picture Score Album of the Year. Released in late 1976, the soundtrack featured three [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] R&B Top Ten singles: "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]," "[[I Wanna Get Next to You]]," and "[[I\'m Going Down (Rose Royce song)|I\'m Going Down]]." The first of these was also a number one single on the Billboard popular music charts, and "I Wanna Get Next to You" reached number ten.

The group\'s follow-up album, \'\'Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom\'\', produced two Top Ten singles, "Do Your Dance" and "[[Ooh Boy (song)|Ooh Boy]]".  It also included "[[Wishing on a Star]]", which for Rose Royce was a top-10 hit only in the [[UK]]; it became notable elsewhere through its cover versions, including [[The Cover Girls]]\' Top Ten single in 1992.

During 1978, they released their third album, entitled \'\'Rose Royce III: Strikes Again!\'\', and it featured "I\'m in Love (And I Love the Feeling)" and "[[Love Don\'t Live Here Anymore]]". Both singles entered the Billboard R&B Top Five.  "Love Don\'t Live Here Anymore" also gained greater exposure through its cover versions, most notably by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 1984 and 1995.

The group followed with a series of modest successes that reached the charts, but never gained the status that their previous songs did. Dickey left the group in April 1980 and the band temporarily disbanded.<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years">{{cite book

Rose Royce was featured in the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\'s seasonal series, \'\'Unsung\'\' during the spring of 2010.  The story featured the successes and internal bickering of the group.  Dickey, Copeland, Jobe, Moore and Garner were the only members of the band who gave interviews throughout the program. Dickey now performs as a solo artist in the UK, but mentioned during the interview that she would not mind performing with the group once again.

In addition, [[Jay-Z]] recorded his own song, also called "[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]", for which Gwen Dickey re-recorded some of her original lyrics and was credited as a featured artist. And the song "[[Theme from S-Express]]" by [[S-Express]] uses a substantial portion of "Is It Love You\'re After" as a sample.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Ayers was born in Los Angeles, and grew up in a musical family, where his father played trombone and his mother played piano.<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|last=Ginell |first=Richard S. |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p6035/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic biography |publisher=Allmusic.com |date=September 10, 1940 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref><ref>Ratner, Jonathan. "To Put on Ayers Is Still Divine: Pioneering Vibe-ist on Tour with His Funky All-stars." National Post January 1, 2006: AL4. Print.</ref> At the age of five, he was given his first pair of vibraphone [[mallet]]s by [[Lionel Hampton]]. The area of Los Angeles that Ayers grew up in, now known as "[[South Los Angeles|South Central]]" but then known as "[[South Park, Los Angeles|South Park]]", was the epicenter of the [[Southern California]] [[Black music]] scene. The schools he attended (Wadsworth Elementary, Nevins Middle School, and [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]) were all close to the famed [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]], Los Angeles\' equivalent of [[Harlem]]\'s [[Lenox Avenue]] and Chicago\'s [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]]. Roy would likely have been exposed to music as it not only emanated from the many nightclubs and bars in the area, but also poured out of many of the homes where the musicians who kept the scene alive lived in and around Central. During high school, Ayers sang in the church choir<ref>Maxwell, Michele. "Roy Ayers: A Musical Perfectionist." Hyde Park Citizen Jan. 1, 2000: 24. Print.</ref> and fronted a band named The Latin Lyrics, in which he played steel guitar and piano.<ref>Nichol, Alan. "Ayers Rocks." Evening Chronicle January 1, 2005, 01B ed.: 2. Print.</ref> His high school, [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Thomas Jefferson High School]], produced some of the most talented new musicians, such as [[Dexter Gordon]].

===Career===
Ayers started recording as a bebop sideman in 1962 and rose to prominence when he dropped out of City College<ref>Shuler, Deardra. "Roy Ayers Sampled by Major Hip Hop Artists." New York \tBeacon January 1, 2006: 28. Print.</ref> and joined jazz flutist Herbie Mann in 1966.<ref>Massimo, Rick. "The Sound of Music \xe2\x80\x93 Roy Ayers Has That Jazz Vibe Going:." The Providence Journal January 1, 2005: F.23. Print.</ref>

In the early 70\'s, Roy Ayers started his own band called Roy Ayer\'s Ubiquity, which he chose to name because ubiquity means a state of being everywhere at the same time.<ref>Shuler, Deardra. "Roy Ayers: Everybody Loves His \'Sunshine\'" New York Amsterdam News1 Jan. 2010: 23. Print.</ref>

Ayers was responsible for the highly regarded soundtrack to [[Jack Hill]]\'s 1973 [[blaxploitation]] film \'\'[[Coffy]]\'\', which starred [[Pam Grier]]. He later moved from a jazz-funk sound to [[R&B]], as seen on \'\'Mystic Voyage\'\', which featured the songs "Evolution" and the underground disco hit "Brother Green (The Disco King)", as well as the title track from his 1976 album \'\'[[Everybody Loves the Sunshine]]\'\'.
 
In 1977, Ayers produced an album by the group [[RAMP]], \'\'Come into Knowledge\'\', commonly and mistakenly thought to stand for "Roy Ayers Music Project".<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> That fall, he had his biggest hit with "Running Away".

In late 1979, Ayers scored his only top ten single on \'\'Billboard\'s\'\' [[Dance/Club Play Songs|Hot Disco/Dance chart]] with "Don\'t Stop The Feeling," which was also the leadoff single from his 1980 album "No Stranger to Love", whose title track was sampled in [[Jill Scott]]\'s 2001 song "Watching Me" from her debut album \'\'Who Is Jill Scott?\'\'

In the late 70\'s, Ayers toured in Nigeria for six weeks with Fela Anikulapo Kuti, widely acknowledged as Africa\'s number one musician.<ref>No Author. "An Open Letter from Roy Ayers." The Indianapolis Recorder January 1, 1980: 10. Print.</ref>

==Career==
Their first [[hit record|hit]] was the 1977 "Uptown Festival," released on [[Soul Train Records]]. Its success inspired Griffey and [[Don Cornelius]] to replace [[session musician|session]] singers with popular [[Soul Train]] dancers [[Jody Watley]] and [[Jeffrey Daniel]] to join original Shalamar lead singer Gary Mumford. Gerald Brown took over the spot vacated by Mumford in 1978 for the [[Disco Gardens]] album which featured the hit "Take That To The Bank". After conflicts over lack of payment from [[Dick Griffey]] and [[Solar Records]], Brown would leave the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDWhuwbYtIM |title=Unsung Shalamar Unfiltered Part 8 Gerald Brown "Take That To The Bank" Conclusion |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref> [[Howard Hewett]] replaced Brown in 1979.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4478|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Ron Wynn |accessdate=20 Oct 2011}}</ref>

The group was joined up with [[record producer|producer]] [[Leon Sylvers III]] in 1979, signed with Griffey\'s [[SOLAR Records]] and scored a [[United States|US]] million seller with "[[The Second Time Around (Shalamar song)|The Second Time Around]]."

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the group had a string of hits with songs such as "Take That to the Bank" (1978), "I Owe You One" (1980) and 1982\'s "I Can Make You Feel Good", "[[A Night to Remember (Shalamar song)|A Night to Remember]]", "There It Is" and "Friends".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The album of the same title \'\'[[Friends (Shalamar album)|Friends]]\'\' was also a big seller in the UK in 1982 crossing the genres of [[popular music|pop]], disco and [[soul music|soul]]. The band\'s record sales in the UK increased when Daniel demonstrated his [[Popping|body-popping]] [[dancing]] skills on [[BBC Television]]\'s music programme, \'\'[[Top of the Pops]]\'\', premiering the [[Moonwalk (dance)|Moonwalk]] on television for the first time.  [[Michael Jackson]] was a [[fan (person)|fan]] of the group, in particular, Daniel and his dance moves, after watching him on \'\'Soul Train\'\'.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  Jackson and Daniel met after, and Jackson took his then 12 year old sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] to see Shalamar perform at Disneyland.  Daniel co-choreographed Jackson\'s "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" and "[[Smooth Criminal]]" [[music video|videos]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} along with Jackson himself.

The "classic" lineup of Shalamar (Hewett, Watley, and Daniel) scored a total of three [[Music recording sales certification|gold albums]] in the US with \'\'Big Fun\'\', \'\'Three for Love\'\' (which eventually went [[music recording sales certification|platinum]]) and \'\'Friends\'\'.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

The group took a knock when Watley and Daniel separately left the band over conflicts within the group and other issues with Dick Griffey and Solar Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shalamaronline.com/2013/07/jeffrey-daniel-spills-beans-on-shalamar.html |title=Shalamaronline.com |publisher=Shalamaronline.com |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}</ref> Adding to the subsequent departure was Watley\'s increasing frustration with SOLAR Records and Dick Griffey shortly after the release of their next [[album]], \'\'[[The Look (Shalamar album)|The Look]]\'\', in 1983.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/><ref name="AMG"/> Nonetheless, the album yielded a number of UK hit [[single (music)|single]]s including "Disappearing Act", "Dead Giveaway" and "[[Over and Over (Shalamar song)|Over and Over]]". The album itself moved Shalamar into a more [[New wave music|new wave]]/[[synthpop]] direction, with rock [[guitar]]s to the fore. But \'\'The Look\'\' generally was not the success that \'\'Friends\'\' had been the previous year.

With a mid 1980s line-up change with [[Micki Free]] and Delisa Davis, Shalamar returned to the US Top 20 in 1984 with "Dancing in the Sheets" from the \'\'[[Footloose (soundtrack)|Footloose]]\'\' [[soundtrack]], peaking at #17, and they won a [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Grammy]] for "Don\'t Get Stopped in Beverly Hills" from \'\'[[Beverly Hills Cop]]\'\' in [[Grammy Awards of 1984|1984]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/><ref name="AMG"/>

Hewett departed to begin his [[solo (music)|solo]] career in 1985, and was replaced by Sydney Justin. Following Hewett\'s departure, the band faded into temporary obscurity.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/><ref name="AMG"/> \'\'[[Circumstantial Evidence (Shalamar album)|Circumstantial Evidence]]\'\' (1987) did not sell well, and the band broke up shortly after \'\'[[Wake Up (Shalamar album)|Wake Up]]\'\' was released in 1990.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Reunions==
In 1996, Watley rejoined with Hewett and Daniel, plus [[LL Cool J]], on [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds|Babyface]]\'s million-selling single "[[This Is for the Lover in You]]"; a [[cover version|cover]] of a hit single from Shalamar\'s 1980 album \'\'[[Three for Love]]\'\'.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{cite book

In 1999, [[Howard Hewett]] and [[Jeffrey Daniel]] reformed Shalamar and played in Japan.  This was followed by UK tours in 2000, 2001 and 2003.  From 2003, Shalamar continued touring with the line up of [[Howard Hewett]], [[Jeffrey Daniel]] and [[Carolyn Griffey]]. In 2005 this line up appeared on the UK [[television program|television series]], \'\'[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time]]\'\', with original members Daniel and  Hewett, and with [[Carolyn Griffey]] (a long-time friend and [[fan (person)|fan]] of the original band, and daughter of Shalamar founder and Solar Record boss Dick Griffey). Carolyn\'s mother is [[Carrie Lucas]] for whom Watley sang backing vocals.  They reached the grand final of \'\'Hit Me, Baby, One More Time\'\' in May 2005, ultimately losing out to [[Shakin\' Stevens]].

Shalamar was featured in a segment of [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]\'s series \'\'[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]\'\', in which Watley, Daniel and Hewett shared their stories about the creation of the group, the lack of payment and royalties from Solar Records, success, egos, and the breakup of the classic lineup.  Dick Griffey, Micki Free, Delisa Davis, and Sydney Justin were also interviewed for the episode.

In October 2009, the reformed Shalamar of Hewett, Daniel and Griffey, performed as a part of "The Ultimate Boogie Nights Disco Concert Series", at IndigO2 within [[The O2 (London)|O2 Arena]] Entertainment Avenue in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gtvone.com/2009/11/03/shalamar-a-shadow-of-their-former-selves/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122064440/http://gtvone.com/2009/11/03/shalamar-a-shadow-of-their-former-selves/ |archivedate=2009-11-22 |title=

}}
\'\'\'Skyy\'\'\' (a.k.a. New York Skyy) was an [[United States|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Funk music|funk]]/[[disco]] [[musical ensemble|band]] based in [[New York City|New York]].  They are perhaps best known for their 1981 hit, "[[Call Me (Skyy song)|Call Me]]", as well as their 1989 "comeback" hits, "[[Start of a Romance]]" and "[[Real Love (Skyy song)|Real Love]]".

==Career==
The seeds for Skyy were sown in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] in 1973, when sisters Denise, Delores, and Bonne Dunning first met musician Solomon Roberts, Jr. The [[record producer]]/[[keyboardist]] Randy Muller (who was also a member [[Brass Construction]] and an [[arrangement|arranger]] for [[B.T. Express]]) soon became involved with the project.  By 1976, the Skyy lineup of the three Dunning sisters as [[singer|vocalists]], Roberts as the male vocalist/[[guitarist]], Anibal Anthony Sierra on [[guitars]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], Larry Greenberg on keyboards, Gerald Lebon on [[bass guitar|bass]], and Tommy McConnell on [[drum kit|drums]] had solidified.

In the late 1970s, Skyy signed to [[Salsoul Records]].  After several albums that saw moderate success in the [[R&B]] market, the group crossed over to the mainstream in a big way with the release of the \'\'Skyy Line\'\' album in late 1981.  Featured on this album was the single "[[Call Me (Skyy song)|Call Me]]", which gave the group their first (and only, to date) [[top 40]] hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop charts]], peaking at number 26 in 1982.  It also became the first of several number one [[R&B chart|R&B]] hits for Skyy.  Meanwhile, the group continued to record for the Salsoul label up through the release of their 1984 \'\'Inner City\'\' album (Salsoul would fold in 1985), scoring several additional [[chart-topper|hits]] on the R&B chart during that time.

In the mid-1980s, the group signed with [[Capitol Records]] and released their next album, \'\'From the Left Side\'\' in 1986.  Apart from the [[Top 40|top ten]] R&B single, "Givin\' It (to You)", the album saw limited success, and the group left Capitol soon thereafter.

Things were looking rather bleak for the band by the late 1980s.  However, after signing to [[Atlantic Records]], Skyy launched a major comeback in 1989 with the release of their successful \'\'Start of a Romance\'\' album.  This release spun off two number one [[R&B chart|R&B]] singles, with both the title track ("[[Start of a Romance]]") and the [[quiet storm]] classic, "[[Real Love (Skyy song)|Real Love]]" claiming the top spot.  "Real Love" also became the group\'s second and final crossover pop hit peaking at number 47 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in early 1990.  The second single released from the album (between the title track and "Real Love"), "Love All the Way" also cracked the R&B top 50.  By the release of the \'\'Nearer to You\'\' album in 1992, the hits had again dried up, and the band has not released a new studio album since then.

In 2014, the French Nu-Disco act Solidisco released an updated version of Skyy\'s 1980 single "Here\'s To You", in which the group received credits due to the original version being used.

\'\'\'Slave\'\'\' was an [[Ohio]] [[list of funk musicians and bands|funk band]] popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  [[Trumpet]]er Steve Washington and Mark Hicks (Drac) formed the group in [[Dayton, Ohio]]  in 1975.

==Career==
Trombonist Floyd Miller teamed with Tom Lockett Jr. (tenor & alto sax), Carter Bradley (keyboards), Mark Adams (bass), Mark Hicks (lead and rhythm guitar, background vocals), Danny Webster (rhythm and lead guitar, lead and background vocals), Orion Wilhoite (keyboards) and Tim Dozier (drums). [[Drummer]]/[[percussionist]] [[Steve Arrington]], along with [[Singer|vocalists]] [[Aurra|Starleana Young]], then [[Aurra|Curt Jones]] and keyboardist Ray Turner came aboard in 1978, with Arrington ultimately becoming lead vocalist. Their first big [[chart-topper|hit]] was the [[single (music)|single]] "Slide" in 1977 for [[Cotillion Records]], where they remained until 1984. Their best work was usually based on bass licks and the band\'s general [[arrangement]]s emphasis on the rhythm section and soaring lead vocals.

Other [[Top 40|Top Ten]] R&B hits were "Just a Touch of Love" in 1979, "Watching You" in 1980, and "Snap Shot" in 1981. They added Charles Carter on sax and brother Sam Carter on keyboards. Young, Washington, Jones and Lockett departed to form Aurra in 1981. Slave added Roger Parker, Delbert Taylor, Jr., and Kevin Johnson as replacements. Arrington himself left in 1982 after the \'\'Showtime\'\' album. The band continued on, though much less successfully, into the late 1980s.

They moved to [[Atlantic Records]] for one [[Gramophone record|LP]] in 1984, then switched to the [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based Ichiban Records in 1986. Their most recent release was \'\'The Funk Strikes Back\'\' in 1992. Rhino issued \'\'Stellar Fungk: The Best of Slave Featuring Steve Arrington\'\', an [[anthology]] of their finest cuts, in 1994.

==Career==
Thomas first attracted interest in his work as an [[accompanist]] with [[Donald Byrd]] and [[Cannonball Adderley]], before working as a [[session musician]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], and releasing [[single (music)|singles]] on the [[Goldwax Records]] [[record label|label]].  He had little [[solo (music)|solo]] success until he moved to [[Glades Records]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], and in late 1972 he released "Why Can\'t We Live Together".  The [[gramophone record|record]] topped the [[United States|U.S.]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], made the top three in the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]], and [[Top 40|Top Ten]] in many other countries including the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> The track peaked at #12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> This [[gramophone record|disc]] sold over two million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

He was earlier part of a group called Phillip & The Faithfuls, which also included the singer Phillip Reynolds, releasing material for the Goldwax imprint, including "Love Me", "What\'Cha Gonna Do" and "\'If You Love Her" (all in 1964). He then became a session musician in Memphis, continuing to release solo sides for Goldwax, including "Have Some Boogaloo" and "It\'s My Life" in 1967. In 1970, he had switched labels to the Climax imprint and one side called "What\'s Bothering Me." Relocating to Miami, Florida, in 1972, Thomas played sessions for the TK group labels, signing to the Glades Records imprint, where, later that year, he released "Why Can\'t We Live Together".

Thomas followed up the release with "People Are Changin" b/w "Rainbow Power", which reached the charts in 1973. In 1974, he released the album \'\'You\'re The Song I Always Wanted To Sing\'\'. He went on to release six further Glades singles and then, in 1975 recorded a duet with [[Betty Wright]] entitled "It\'s What They Can\'t See". From 1976 through 1980, Thomas recorded singles for both the Glades imprint and the T.K. Disco label, including "Stone To The Bone", "Africano", "Touch To Touch", "The Magician", "Freak In, Freak Out", and "Drown In My Own Tears" and the albums "The Magician" (Glades, 1976) and "Touch To Touch" (Glades, 1977). He also continued to work on sessions for [[TK Records]] [[recording artist|artist]]s, including [[Gwen McCrae]], and in later years as a producer.

Thomas went on to record several R&B hits culminating in "Gotta Give A Little Love (Ten Years After)", a U.S. Top 30 soul entry in 1984 for Gold Mountain Records. Thomas appeared on [[Nicole McCloud]]\'s 1985 album \'\'What About Me?\'\', singing on a duet with her called "New York Eyes".  This track reached #41 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

| page= 557}}</ref> The follow-up "People Are Changin\'" made the charts the next year, and he continued to issue singles.  The perception of him as a [[one-hit wonder]] is belied by his continued success in the R&B chart, where he had several further hits through 1984. In the 1990s, he worked as a producer for LaFace Records and released the album \'\'With Heart and Soul\'\' for the DTM Records.

\'\'\'The Temptations\'\'\' are an American vocal group known for their success with [[Motown Records]] during the 1960s and 1970s. Known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and flashy wardrobe, the group was highly influential to the evolution of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]] music.<ref>Graff, Gary (1988-08-29).

Retrieved on 2005-11-05.</ref> {{As of|2015}}, the Temptations continue to perform with one living original member, [[Otis Williams]], still in the lineup.

Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with less or more members), the group formed in 1960 in [[Detroit, Michigan]] under the name "The Elgins". The original founding members were originally members of two rival Detroit vocal groups: [[Otis Williams]], [[Elbridge Bryant|Elbridge "Al" Bryant]], and [[Melvin Franklin]] of Otis Williams & the Distants, and [[Eddie Kendricks]] and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by [[David Ruffin]], who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group\'s biggest hits, including "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]" (1964), "[[Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg]]" (1966), and "[[I Wish It Would Rain]]" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by [[Dennis Edwards]], with whom the group continued to record hit records such as "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]" (1969) and "[[Ball of Confusion (That\'s What the World is Today)]]" (1970). The group\'s lineup has changed frequently since the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams from the act in 1971. Later members of the group have included singers such as [[Richard Street]], [[Damon Harris]], [[Ron Tyson]], and [[Ali-Ollie Woodson]], with whom the group scored a late-period hit in 1984 with "[[Treat Her Like a Lady (The Temptations song)|Treat Her Like a Lady]]".

Over the course of their career, the Temptations have released four [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] number-one singles and fourteen [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B number-one singles]], and their material has earned them three [[Grammy Award]]s. The Temptations were the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award - for "Cloud Nine" in 1969<ref>Ribowsky (2010), pg. 197</ref> - and in 2013 received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|inducted]] to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, "My Girl", "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]", and "[[Papa Was a Rollin\' Stone]]", are among [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. The Temptations were also ranked at #68 on \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine\'s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time.

==History==

===Origins===
Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams started singing together in church as children. By their teenage years, they formed a doo-wop quartet in 1955 with [[Kell Osborne]] and Wiley Waller, naming themselves the Cavaliers.<ref name="HardinEarlyYears">{{cite web | last = Hardin | first = Ritchie | title = The Tangled History of The Temptations | publisher = The Ritchie Hardin Network | date = July 17, 2004 | url = http://www.ritchie-hardin.com/soul/temps0.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051018055156/http://www.ritchie-hardin.com/soul/temps0.html | archivedate = 2005-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-02-09 }}</ref> After Waller left the group in 1957, the remaining trio left Birmingham to break into the music business. The group settled at Detroit where they changed their name to the Primes under the direction of Milton Jenkins. The Primes soon became well known around the Detroit area for their meticulous performances.<ref name="Siberians">Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 26\xe2\x80\x9330.</ref> Jenkins later created the "sister group", The Primettes, later known as [[the Supremes]]. Kendricks was already seen as a "matinee idol" in the Detroit area while Williams was well received for his baritone vocals.<ref name="HardinEarlyYears"/> [[Texarkana, Texas|Texas]] teenager Otis Williams moved to Detroit as a youngster to be with his mother. By 1958, Williams was the leader of a vocal group named Otis Williams and the Siberians. The group included Elbridge "Al" Bryant, James "Pee-Wee" Crawford, Vernard Plain and Arthur Walton. The group recorded a song, "Pecos Kid" for a label run by radio deejay Senator Bristol Bryant.<ref name="havegun">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 232</ref> Shortly after its release, the group changed its name to The El Domingoes. Following this, [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] native Melvin Franklin replaced Arthur Walton as bass vocalist and Franklin\'s cousin, Detroit-born [[Richard Street]], replaced Vernard Plain as lead singer. Signing with [[Johnnie Mae Matthews]]\' Northern Records, the group had their name changed again to The Distants.

The group recorded two Northern singles including "Come On" (1959) and "Alright" (1960).<ref name="Distants">Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 32\xe2\x80\x9338.</ref> Between these releases, Albert "Mooch" Harrell replaced Pee-Wee Crawford.<ref name="Distants" /> "Come On" became a local hit and the Warwick Records label picked the record up for national distribution.<ref name="Distants" /> Following the release of "Alright", Matthews appointed Williams the group leader, and the group\'s name was changed to Otis Williams & The Distants.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 40.</ref> During this period, both the Primes and Distants were influenced by other vocal groups including [[the Miracles]].<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 30, 40\xe2\x80\x9341.</ref> Other inspirations included the [[The Cadillacs|Cadillacs]], [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers]], [[the Drifters]], and [[the Isley Brothers]].<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 9, 32.</ref> Though "Come On" was a local hit in the Detroit area, the Distants never saw much record sales and "Alright" wasn\'t as successful. After receiving an offer from [[Berry Gordy]] to sign with [[Motown Records]], the Distants got out of their contract with Northern Records. However, Mooch Harrell and Richard Street shortly departed from the group and the remaining members lost use of the Distants name. Richard Street later formed another Distants group who recorded for the Thelma label in the early 1960s.

===Early years===
[[File:Pre-ruffin-tempts.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A promotional image of the original early 1960s Temptations lineup. Clockwise from top right: Otis Williams, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, and Elbridge "Al" Bryant.]]
Members of the Distants were acquainted with the Primes as both groups participated in the same talent shows and performed at the same public venues. Friendly rivals, the Primes were considered to be the more polished and vocally stronger group of the two. The Primes disbanded in 1960 after Kell Osborne moved to California. Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams returned to Alabama following the band\'s dissolution. While visiting relatives in Detroit, Kendricks called Otis Williams, who desperately needed two more members for an audition for Gordy\'s label and offered Kendricks a lead singer place in his new group. Kendricks agreed on the condition he bring Paul Williams with him. Otis Williams happily agreed and Kendricks and Paul Williams moved back to Detroit to join the new group.

The original name for the new lineup of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Elbridge "Al" Bryant, Eddie Kendricks, and Paul Williams was the Elgins. Under that name, the group auditioned for Motown in March 1961. Already impressed with some of the members after hearing session work, Berry Gordy agreed to sign the group to the Motown imprint, Miracle. However, before signing, Gordy discovered another group was using the name of Elgins. The group began tossing about ideas for a new name on the steps of the [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] studio. On a suggestion from Miracle Records employee Billy Mitchell, songwriter Mickey Stevenson, and group members Otis Williams and Paul Williams, The Temptations became the group\'s new moniker. The "Elgins" name would re-surface at Motown in 1965, when Gordy renamed a quartet called the Downbeats as [[the Elgins]].

The Temptations\' first two singles, "[[Oh Mother of Mine]]" and "[[Check Yourself]]", with Paul Williams on lead, were released on Miracle before Gordy closed the label down and reassigned the band to his latest imprint, Gordy Records. On the Gordy imprint, Eddie Kendricks sang lead on the Temptations\' first charted single, "[[(You\'re My) Dream Come True|Dream Come True]]", which peaked at #22 on the R&B chart in 1962. Later that year, the Temptations began touring as part of the [[Motortown Revue]]. The group would issue eight recordings between 1961 and 1963 without much success. Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks split the leads during this early period, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead, as they would on a song titled "Isn\'t She Pretty". For a brief time, the group almost had their name changed to The Pirates, and recorded the songs "Mind Over Matter" and "I\'ll Love You Till I Die" under that name. Eventually the label and the group decided against it. One hit song, "[[Do You Love Me]]", was originally set to be recorded by the Temptations. When he couldn\'t get a hold of the group, Gordy produced a version for [[the Contours]]. In 1963, the Temptations began working with [[Smokey Robinson]] as producer and writer. Robinson\'s first work with the group was the Paul Williams-led "[[I Want a Love I Can See]]". While the song failed to chart, it did eventually become a popular live performance spot for the group and particularly for Paul Williams in general. Due to their lack of hits, the group was given the nickname, "The Hitless Temptations".

During this time, [[David Ruffin]] began following the group around as he aspired to join the group. During a local Detroit performance, Ruffin joined the group onstage and impressed the group with his vocal talent and dancing skills.<ref>Williams and Romanowski (1988), pp. 68\xe2\x80\x9370.</ref> Following that same time, Al Bryant had grown frustrated with the group\'s lack of success and became restless and uncooperative, preferring the mundane routine of his day job as a milkman over the rigors of rehearsal and performing. After a heated quarrel with Paul and hitting him in the head with a beer bottle following a disastrous performance at the 1963 Motown company [[Christmas]]/[[New Years Eve]] party, Bryant was summarily fired from the group. As a result, [[David Ruffin]] was brought in as his replacement in January 1964. Though Ruffin\'s brother, [[Jimmy Ruffin|Jimmy]] was also considered for the slot, David was selected following his performance with them in 1963. Bryant continued to perform in a number of other local groups, and died at the age of 36 in [[Flagler County, Florida]] of [[liver cirrhosis]] on October 26, 1975.

===The "Classic Five" Era===
In [[1964 in music|January 1964]], Smokey Robinson and Miracles bandmate [[Bobby Rogers]] co-wrote and produced "[[The Way You Do the Things You Do]]" with Eddie Kendricks on lead and the single became the Temptations\' first Top 20 hit that April.

Shortly afterward, "The Way You Do The Things You Do" and several pre-David Ruffin singles were compiled into the group\'s first album, \'\'[[Meet The Temptations]]\'\', released in early 1964. The next two Temptations singles in 1964, "[[Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)]]" along with "[[I\'ll Be in Trouble]]" and its [[B-side]] "[[The Girl\'s Alright With Me]]",  all featured Kendricks on lead. However, producer Smokey Robinson saw potential in the "mellow" yet "gruff" voice of David Ruffin, and thought that if he could write the perfect song for his lead, then the group could have a Top 10 hit.<ref name="NPRstory">Blair, Elizabeth (June 4, 2000). "[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1074993 Weekend Edition: \'My Girl\']". \'\'NPR\'\'. Retrieved May 17, 2009.</ref>

While traveling as part of Motown\'s [[Motortown Revue]] later that year, Robinson and fellow Miracles member [[Ronnie White]] wrote "[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]", which the Temptations recorded in the fall of 1964 with Ruffin singing his first lead vocal for the group. Released as a single on December 21, 1964, the song became the Temptations\' first number-one pop hit in [[1965 in music|March 1965]], and is their signature song to this day.

After the success of "My Girl", Ruffin sang lead on the next three singles: "[[It\'s Growing]]", "[[Since I Lost My Baby]]", and "[[My Baby (Temptations song)|My Baby]]", all of which made it to the Top 20 in 1965. The [[B-side]] to "My Baby", "[[Don\xe2\x80\x99t Look Back (Temptations song)|Don\xe2\x80\x99t Look Back]]", featured a stirring lead from Paul Williams, and was a [[sleeper hit]] on the R&B charts and a standard for vocal group playlists.

Norman Whitfield had requested the opportunity to write for the group and in 1966, Berry Gordy promised him that if Robinson\'s "[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]", with Eddie Kendricks on lead, failed to chart in the Top 20, Whitfield would be allowed to produce the next song. "Get Ready" subsequently missed its mark, and Gordy issued the Whitfield-produced "[[Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg]]", with David Ruffin on lead, as the next single. "Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg" outperformed "Get Ready" on the \'\'Billboard\'\' charts, and Whitfield became the Temptations\' new main producer. He began pulling the group away from the [[ballad]]-based productions espoused by Robinson, toward a harder-edged and [[brass]]-heavy soul sound reminiscent of [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]].

Nearly all of the singles produced by Whitfield prior to 1968 featured David Ruffin on lead, including the R&B number-one/pop Top 10 hits "[[Beauty Is Only Skin Deep]]", "[[(I Know) I\'m Losing You]]"<ref name=pc50>{{Pop Chronicles|50|4}}</ref> and the early 1967 hit "[[(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It\'s You That I Need]]". Other important singles from this period include "[[All I Need (The Temptations song)|All I Need]]", produced by [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]], a Whitfield prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, and the "[[You\'re My Everything]]", on which Kendricks and Ruffin share lead. Studio albums during the "Classic Five" period apart from \'\'Meet The Temptations\'\' include \'\'[[The Temptations Sing Smokey]]\'\' (1965), \'\'[[The Temptin\' Temptations]]\'\' (1965), \'\'[[Gettin\' Ready]]\'\' (1966), \'\'[[The Temptations with a Lot o\' Soul]]\'\' (1967), and \'\'[[The Temptations Wish It Would Rain]]\'\' (1968).

During this period, the various songwriting partners of Norman Whitfield included [[Roger Penzabene]], [[Edward Holland, Jr.]], and Temptations road show manager and guitarist [[Cornelius Grant]]. Subsequently, [[Barrett Strong]], who sang the very first hit at Motown in 1959, "[[Money (That\'s What I Want)]]", began working with Whitfield and Penzabene on Temptations material after Eddie Holland left Motown with the rest of the [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] songwriting/production team in 1967. Two of the Whitfield-Strong-Penzabene collaborations, "[[I Wish It Would Rain]]" and "[[I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)]]", became hits in early 1968 after the [[suicide]] of Roger Penzabene in December 1967. Subsequently, Barrett Strong became the sole collaborator of Norman Whitfield.

===Exit David Ruffin, enter Dennis Edwards===
From early 1964 to mid 1968, the Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars and as a result, appeared frequently on television shows such as \'\'[[American Bandstand]],\'\' \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]],\'\' and \'\'[[The Hollywood Palace]].\'\' At the same time, the group began to achieve a crossover success, catering to middle America with a pop standards album (\'\'[[The Temptations in a Mellow Mood]]\'\', 1967), the success of which resulted in performances at the famous [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in [[New York City]] along with dates at other similar supper clubs. Outside of music, the Temptations were made honorary members of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.

By 1967, David Ruffin had begun demanding special treatment as lead singer, riding to and from gigs in a private [[mink]]-lined [[limousine]] with his then-girlfriend, Motown singer [[Tammi Terrell]], instead of in the group limousine used by the other four Temptations. The other members slowly became irritated and annoyed with Ruffin\'s behavior. Following Motown\'s decision to rechristen [[the Supremes]] as \'\'[[Diana Ross & the Supremes]]\'\', Ruffin felt entitled to the same treatment and demanded that his group be renamed as well, to \'\'David Ruffin & the Temptations\'\'.  Ruffin was also causing friction with Berry Gordy by demanding an accounting of the group\'s earnings;<ref name="Accounting" /> Motown partially acquiesced by allowing The Temptations to retain an outside accounting firm, but the firm did not have full access to the books from The Temptations\' manager, International Talent Management, Inc. - a subsidiary of Motown.<ref name="Accounting">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 122-124, 174-177</ref>

Some of this behavior was attributed to the fact that by this time Ruffin had begun using [[cocaine]] regularly, building further tension within the group and causing him to miss a number of group meetings, rehearsals, and concerts.  There was a consensus among the rest of the group that Ruffin needed to be replaced. When Ruffin missed a June 1968 engagement at a Cleveland supper club in order to attend a show by his new girlfriend Barbara Gail Martin (daughter of Dean Martin),<ref>Ribowsky (2010), pg. 171</ref> it was decided that he had crossed the line. The other four Temptations drew up legal documentation, officially firing Ruffin from the group on June 27, 1968.<ref>Ribowsky (2010), pg. 181</ref> The next day, [[Dennis Edwards]], a singer formerly of the Contours that Eddie Kendricks and Otis Williams already had pegged as a potential Ruffin replacement,<ref name="Interview with Dennis Edwards" /> was hired to take Ruffin\'s place.

Edwards and Ruffin were good friends, and at first, Ruffin went along with the changing of the guard and encouraged Edwards. However, at Edwards\' official debut with the Temptations in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]] on July 7, Ruffin came to the show and jumped onstage, taking the microphone from Edwards, singing lead on "Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg", and disappearing as quickly as he\'d appeared.<ref name="RuffinMicSteal">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 184-187</ref> Ruffin repeated this stunt several times throughout the group\'s July tour run. Despite the group hiring extra security to keep Ruffin out, he continued to find ways to sneak into the venue and jump onstage when the group performed one of the songs he had once sung lead on.<ref name="RuffinMicSteal" />

In a story recounted several times by Dennis Edwards,<ref name="Interview with Dennis Edwards" /> though refuted by Otis Williams and Temptations road manager Don Foster,<ref name="RuffinReturn" /> after several of these stunts, the positive audience reactions and a remorseful Ruffin\'s pleas to be let back into the act convinced the other Temptations to do so. Otis Williams informed the then still-new Edwards that the group would lay him off and rehire Ruffin while in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]]. However, when Ruffin failed to show up on time for the next night for his "return" engagement, Edwards was kept on, and the prospect of rehiring Ruffin ceased to be entertained.<ref name="Interview with Dennis Edwards">{{cite web|last=Meros|first=Tom|title=Dennis Edwards (Interview)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djjZtVCRBQk}}</ref><ref name="RuffinReturn">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 187-188</ref>

After Gaithersburg, Ruffin stopped attempting to bogart the Temptations\' concerts and instead turned his attention to the Motown offices back in Detroit. He sued Motown in October 1968, seeking a release from the label, but Motown countersued to keep the singer from leaving and the case was eventually settled out of court.<ref name="RuffinLawsuit">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 199-200</ref> The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown as a solo artist to finish out his contract.<ref name="RuffinLawsuit" />

Edwards\' first album with the Temptations was \'\'[[Live at the Copa (Temptations album)|Live at the Copa]]\'\', recorded at the group\'s return to the Copacabana nightclub. The year 1968 also saw the debut of the first of a number of collaborations for the Temptations with Diana Ross & the Supremes. The results included two studio albums: 1968\'s \'\'[[Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations]]\'\', which featured Edwards\'s first studio recordings with the group and the number-two hit single "[[I\'m Gonna Make You Love Me]]"; and  \'\'[[Together (Supremes and Temptations album)|Together]]\'\'. There was also a joint tour and two [[NBC]] television specials, \'\'[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]\'\' (aired December 9, 1968) and \'\'[[G.I.T. on Broadway]]\'\' (aired November 12, 1969).

===Psychedelic soul===

[[File:The Temptations on the Ed Sullivan Show.JPG||thumb|right|The Temptations perform on \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]\'\' in September 1969. Left to right: [[Otis Williams]], [[Melvin Franklin]], [[Eddie Kendricks]], [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Dennis Edwards]].]]
The addition of Dennis Edwards to the Temptations coincided with the adoption of a new sound for the group by producer Norman Whitfield, and in the fall of 1968, Whitfield began producing [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-based material for the Temptations, derived primarily from the sound of [[funk]] band [[Sly & the Family Stone]]. This new style, which debuted with the Top 10 hit single "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]"<ref name=pc50/> in October 1968, was a marked departure from the David Ruffin-era ballads. The instrumentation was [[funk]]ier, the beat was hard-driving, and all five Temptations traded lead vocals, similar to Sly & the Family Stone. "Cloud Nine", the centerpiece of the group\'s landmark \'\'[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations album)|Cloud Nine]]\'\' LP, was a Top 10 hit and won Motown its first [[Grammy Award]], for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Vocal Group Performance]] [[Grammy Awards of 1969|of 1969]].

The blending of the Motown sound and psychedelic rock sound resulted in a new subgenre of music called "[[psychedelic soul]]", also evident in the work of Diana Ross and the Supremes ("[[Reflections (The Supremes song)|Reflections]]", "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]"), Marvin Gaye\'s version of "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]", and the music of [[the 5th Dimension]], [[the Undisputed Truth]], and [[the Friends of Distinction]]. More Temptations psychedelic soul singles would follow in 1969 and 1970, among them "[[Runaway Child, Running Wild]]" (a number-one R&B hit), "[[I Can\'t Get Next to You]]" (a number-one pop hit), "[[Psychedelic Shack (song)|Psychedelic Shack]]", and "[[Ball of Confusion (That\'s What the World Is Today)]]", but the formula began to wear thin when "Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)", only went to #33 Pop in the fall of 1970. The group\'s other important albums from this period included \'\'[[Puzzle People]]\'\' (1969) and \'\'[[Psychedelic Shack (album)|Psychedelic Shack]]\'\' (1970). \'\'Psychedelic Shack\'\' includes the original version of "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]", later made famous by [[Edwin Starr]].

===Exit Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams===
Paul Williams, who suffered from [[sickle-cell disease]], fell into [[Clinical depression|depression]] because of the stress of touring and personal issues. By the late 1960s, he had developed a serious case of [[alcoholism]].<ref name="paulwilliamsdecline">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 165, 212, 217\xe2\x80\x93222</ref> As his physical and mental health began to decline sharply, it made performing increasingly difficult.

In late 1968, [[Richard Street]], lead singer of Motown act the [[The Monitors (American band)|Monitors]] and a former Distant, was hired by Otis Williams to tour with the group as a backup replacement for Williams.<ref name="paulwilliamsdecline" /><ref name="RStreetABBackup">{{cite book | title=Ball of Confusion: My Life as a Temptin\' Temptation | publisher=Tate Publishing | author=Street, Richard with Flanigan, Gary | authorlink=Richard Street | year=2014 | pages=102\xe2\x80\x93105}}</ref> For most shows, save for his solo numbers, Williams would dance and [[lip-sync]] onstage to parts sung live by Street into an offstage mic behind a curtain.

Eddie Kendricks became detached from the group after David Ruffin\'s firing and as the health of Paul Williams continued to fail. In addition, Kendricks preferred the ballad material from the earlier days and was uncomfortable with the psychedelic soul material the group was now performing. Kendricks rekindled his friendship with Ruffin, who persuaded him to go solo. Kendricks no longer felt he had a say in Otis Williams\'s handling of the group and was also convinced Motown\'s handling of the Temptations\' finances was cheating the group out of money.<ref name="KendricksvOtis">Ribowsky (2010), pg. 213-216, 219-221</ref>

Kendricks lobbied strongly in 1970 to have the Temptations go on "strike" - no performances, no recordings - until Berry Gordy and the Motown staff would be willing to go over all group finances with independent accountants.<ref name="KendricksvOtis" /> Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin strongly opposed this idea, and regular group in-fighting between Kendricks, Otis Williams, and Franklin grew from this disagreement.<ref name="KendricksvOtis" /> After a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, one final confrontation between the three caused Kendricks to walk out in-between shows and not return. Both Kendricks and Williams then agreed that Kendricks would be leaving the group.<ref name="KendricksvOtis" />  Kendricks later stated that he actually considered leaving as early as 1965, but remained with the Temptations and unsuccessfully attempted to get permission to record a solo album without leaving the group.<ref name="eddiekendricksinterview">Interview with Eddie Kendricks, \'\'Urban Street.\'\' Retrieved from [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW1I7TWdWW8] on May 17, 2009</ref>

Before Kendricks officially left the Temptations, he and Paul Williams recorded the lead vocals for "[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]", a ballad that became Kendricks\' final single with the group. Included on the \'\'[[Sky\'s the Limit (The Temptations album)|Sky\'s the Limit]]\'\' LP along with the original album version of "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]", "Just My Imagination" was released as a single in [[1971 in music|January 1971]], and the song began steadily climbing the U.S. pop singles chart, peaking at #1 two months later. By the time "Just My Imagination" topped the charts, Kendricks had negotiated his release from the group and signed a solo deal with Motown\'s Tamla label.

The Temptations originally hired [[Ricky Owens]], from the [[Los Angeles]]-based vocal group [[the Vibrations]], to replace Kendricks. However, Owens only played two dates with the group before he was fired for forgetting the words to his solo numbers due to nervousness.<ref>Ribowsky (2010), Pg. 226</ref> For several weeks of the spring of 1971, the Temptations were without a fifth member. Owens meanwhile returned to the Vibrations and died in [[Los Angeles, California]] on December 6, 1996 at the age of 57.

Whitfield took the remaining Temptations quartet and re-recorded "It\'s Summer", the B-side to "[[Ball of Confusion (That\'s What the World Is Today)]]", as a replacement single. "Smiling Faces Sometimes" was released as a single for [[the Undisputed Truth]] instead, becoming a Top 5 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] in 1971. Meanwhile, "It\'s Summer" peaked at #51 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first Temptations single to miss the Top 40 since "[[Farewell My Love]]" eight years earlier.

After his doctor declared a few weeks later that he was unable to continue performing due to medical reasons, Paul Williams quit the Temptations in May.<ref>Ribowsky (2010), Pg. 227</ref>  Richard Street officially took Williams\' place, although Williams continued to be paid his customary one-fifth of group revenue (Street was paid on salary for the first eighteen months of his tenure),<ref>Ribowsky (2010), Pg. 236</ref> and worked when he could with the group as an adviser and choreographer. After Williams had recovered enough to record again, he recorded two sides in 1973 for a debut solo single. However, on August 17, 1973, Williams died in Detroit at the age of 34 from a gunshot wound, his death ruled a suicide by the [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] coroner.

===The Temptations in the early 1970s===
[[File:Temptations - solid rock.jpg|right|thumb|200px|\'\'Solid Rock\'\', the first studio album featuring Richard Street and Damon Harris, featured the new members prominently on its front cover. Pictured L-R: Damon Harris, Richard Street (top row), Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Dennis Edwards (bottom)]]
In May 1971, The Temptations finally found a permanent replacement for the first tenor position in twenty-year-old [[Baltimore]] native [[Damon Harris]]. Otis Williams, Edwards, Franklin, Street, and Harris continued recording and performing, and Norman Whitfield continued producing hits for them. There were Top 40 hits such as "[[Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)]]" (1971), a message from the Temptations to David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, and "Take a Look Around" (1972). During this period, the group toured with [[Quiet Elegance]] as their back-up singers. Quiet Elegance featured [[Lois Reeves]], the sister of [[Martha Reeves]], alongside Frankie Gearing and Millie Vaney-Scott.

Late 1972, was the release of "[[Papa Was a Rollin\' Stone]]", a [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and produced by Whitfield. Originally a three-minute record written and produced for the  [[Undisputed Truth]], Whitfield took the somber tune and created a sprawling, dramatic twelve-minute version for the Temptations\xe2\x80\x94a forerunner of the extended single, soon to become popular in clubs and discoth\xc3\xa8ques. An edited seven-minute version was released as a single and became one of the longest hit singles in music history: it hit #1 on the pop charts and #5 on the R&B charts. In 1973, "Papa Was a Rollin\' Stone" won the Temptations their second Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Group]]. Whitfield and arranger/conductor Paul Riser won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance|Best R&B Instrumental Performance]] for the instrumental version on the B-side, and Whitfield and Barrett Strong won the songwriting Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]].

After "Papa Was a Rollin\' Stone", Whitfield stopped working with Barrett Strong, and began writing the Temptations\' material on his own. The success of "Papa" led Whitfield to create more elongated, operatic pieces, including the Top 10 hit "[[Masterpiece (Temptations song)|Masterpiece]]" (1973) and several of the tracks on the resulting \'\'[[Masterpiece (Temptations album)|Masterpiece]]\'\' album. Tensions developed between Whitfield and the group, who found Whitfield arrogant and difficult to work with, and the group citing his habitual tardiness, his emphasis of the instrumental tracks over the vocals on many of his productions, and the declining singles and albums sales as other sources of conflict, sought to change producers.<ref name="ChangingProd">Williams and Romanowski, (2002) pp. 161\xe2\x80\x93166</ref> Otis Williams complained about Whitfield\'s actions and the Temptations\' stagnant sales to Berry Gordy; as a result, the group was reassigned to [[Jeffrey Bowen]], co-producer of the 1967 \'\'[[In a Mellow Mood (Temptations album)|In a Mellow Mood]]\'\' album.<ref name="ChangingProd" />

The final Norman Whitfield-produced Temptations album, \'\'[[1990 (Temptations album)|1990]]\'\', was released in December 1973, and included the Top 30 single "[[Let Your Hair Down (The Temptations song)|Let Your Hair Down]]". Shortly afterwards, Whitfield left Motown, and in 1975 established [[Whitfield Records]], taking the Undisputed Truth and [[Willie Hutch]] with him, along with [[Rose Royce]]---who performed an instrumental track for "Let Your Hair Down" before recording their 1976 smash \'\'[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]\'\'.

===Dry spell===
Bowen\'s first LP with the Temptations was [[1975 in music|January 1975]]\'s \'\'[[A Song for You (The Temptations album)|A Song for You]]\'\', which included a cover of the titular [[Leon Russell]] tune (popularized with soul audiences by [[Donny Hathaway]]), along with the pop Top 40/R&B number-one hits "[[Happy People (The Temptations song)|Happy People]]" (featuring the [[The Commodores|Commodores]] as the instrumentalists) and "[[Shakey Ground]]" (featuring instrumentation by [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]\'s [[Eddie Hazel]] along with [[Billy Bass Nelson]]). "[[Glasshouse (The Temptations song)|Glasshouse]]", the group\'s final Top 40 Pop hit was also included. Damon Harris was fired from the group during the recording of \'\'A Song for You\'\', as his behavior and work ethic were deemed unprofessional,<ref>Williams and Romanowski, (2002) pp. 170\xe2\x80\x93171</ref>  and his replacement was [[Washington, D.C.]] native [[Glenn Leonard]], formerly of the [[The Unifics|Unifics]].<ref>Williams and Romanowski, (2002), p. 172</ref>

A number of producers, including Bowen, [[Brian Holland]], James Carmichael, and even the Temptations themselves tried producing hits for the next three LPs, \'\'[[House Party (The Temptations album)|House Party]]\'\' (November 1975), \'\'[[Wings of Love]]\'\' ([[1976 in music|March 1976]]), and \'\'[[The Temptations Do the Temptations]]\'\' (August 1976). None of these recordings were as commercially successful as \'\'A Song for You\'\' however, and none of their associated singles entered the Billboard charts.<ref>Williams and Romanowski, (2002), pp. 249, 259</ref>

As time progressed, Bowen pushed Dennis Edwards further to the front of the group.  This was evident on \'\'Wings of Love\'\', where several tracks featured Edwards\' vocal more prominently than the other Temptations\' backing vocals.<ref name="Williams177">Williams and Romanowski, (2002), p. 177</ref> Otis Williams felt that this was hurting the group, accused Motown of inattention, and cited this as the reason for the group\'s declining sales and popularity. After \'\'The Temptations Do the Temptations\'\' was recorded in 1976, Edwards was fired from the group,<ref>Williams and Romanowski, (2002), p. 183</ref> and with new lead [[Louis Price]] on board, they left Motown for [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Williams and Romanowski, (2002), pp. 178\xe2\x80\x93182</ref>

Success continued to elude the group at Atlantic, however. Their two releases on Atlantic \xe2\x80\x93 \'\'[[Hear to Tempt You]]\'\' (1977), and \'\'[[Bare Back]]\'\' (1978), along with their associated singles, had failed to perform any better at Atlantic than their last handful of singles had at Motown. As a result, in 1979, Atlantic released the group from its contract,<ref name="Williams177"/> and shortly afterwards, the Temptations met once again with Smokey Robinson and Berry Gordy, who re-signed the group to Motown in 1980.<ref name=WR190>Williams and Romanowski, (2002), pp. 193\xe2\x80\x93197</ref>

===Return to Motown and \'\'Reunion\'\'===
[[File:Tempts-reunion.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Cover of the 1982 \'\'Reunion\'\' album. Pictured from top left: David Ruffin, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, Glenn Leonard.]]
Upon the return to Motown several lineup changes occurred. Louis Price departed from the group and joined the Drifters. Dennis Edwards\xe2\x80\x94who had made an unsuccessful attempt at developing a solo career during his three-year exit from the group\xe2\x80\x94returned to the lineup. And Berry Gordy co-wrote and produced "Power", the Temptations\' first single under the new contract. "Power", from [[Power (The Temptations album)|the album of the same name]], hit #11 on the R&B charts but failed to chart in the Top 40. Two years of under-performing singles and albums followed, including [[The Temptations (album)|an eponymous album]] with [[Philadelphia]]-based producer [[Thom Bell]], until Motown began planning a Temptations reunion tour in 1982.

Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin agreed to rejoin the group for the new album, aptly titled \'\'[[Reunion (Temptations album)|Reunion]]\'\', and its subsequent promotional tour. [[Rick James]], Melvin Franklin\'s nephew and the Motown [[funk music|funk]] star who had previously used the Temptations as backup vocalists on his 1981 hit "[[Super Freak]]", wrote, produced, and guested on the \'\'Reunion\'\' album\'s lead single, "Standing on the Top". The single went to number-six on the R&B charts and featured Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards trading back and forth on lead.

While the ensuing \'\'Reunion\'\' tour with all seven Temptations (Ruffin, Kendricks, Otis Williams, Franklin, Edwards, Richard Street, and Glenn Leonard) was financially successful, it ended up being a stressful venture. Kendricks\' voice had weakened after decades of [[chain smoking]], Ruffin, still addicted to drugs, missed a number of the performances due to being incapacitated, and current group members Dennis Edwards and Glenn Leonard were causing problems. At the conclusion of the \'\'Reunion\'\' tour, Ruffin and Kendricks departed, and they began touring and performing together as a duo.

One more album, \'\'[[Surface Thrills]]\'\', released in 1983, featured a sharp departure in the group\'s sound by incorporating elements of then-current rock. Following its release, Glenn Leonard was let go and replaced by [[Ron Tyson]], who was with the Philadelphia groups [[the Ethics]] and [[Love Committee]]. Tyson had been a staff songwriter at Atlantic during the Temptations\' tenure at that label, and co-wrote several songs on the album \'\'Hear to Tempt You\'\'.

===From the 1980s to the 1990s===
By this time, the Temptations\' releases were no longer performing well on the pop charts, though some singles still made the R&B Top 20. "Love on My Mind Tonight," a single from \'\'Surface Thrills\'\', charted at number 17.

The lineup of Franklin, Williams, Street, Tyson, and Edwards proved to be short-lived. The five performed on \'\'[[Motown 25]]\'\' and released the [[direct to video]] \'\'The Temptations: Live in Concert\'\' (filmed at [[Harrah\'s Atlantic City]]). The album \'\'[[Back to Basics (The Temptations album)|Back to Basics]]\'\', released later in 1983, was the first album featuring Ron Tyson on lead.  "Sail Away," produced by a returning Norman Whitfield and featuring Ron Tyson\'s first lead vocal, peaked at number 13. In addition, a then-relatively unknown singer/musician, [[Ali-Ollie Woodson]] was featured on one track, "Stop the World Right Here (I Wanna Get Off)."  Woodson was a Detroit native who had been a potential candidate to replace Dennis Edwards back in 1977.  Meanwhile, Edwards (who also had his share of lead vocals on the \'\'Back to Basics\'\' album) was again fired in 1984, for missing rehearsals or showing up [[hangover|hungover]]. He then attempted a second solo career, scoring a hit with the 1984 single "[[Don\'t Look Any Further]]", a duet with [[Siedah Garrett]]. At this point, Woodson officially joined the group, taking Edwards\' place. Woodson\'s first lead on a single was 1984\'s "[[Treat Her Like a Lady (The Temptations song)|Treat Her Like a Lady]]", co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by former [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] members [[Al McKay]] and Ralph Johnson. The single became their biggest success on R&B radio since 1975, reaching number-two on the R&B charts, and just missing the Pop Top 40 at number 48. The group experienced similar success in 1986 with the single "Lady Soul", another Top 5 R&B smash.

Ollie Woodson remained with the Temptations until 1987, when he was fired for consistent lateness. He was replaced by the again-returning Dennis Edwards. The group recorded one album during Edwards\'s third tenure, \'\'[[Together Again (The Temptations album)|Together Again]]\'\', released in late 1987. The following year, Otis Williams published his autobiography, \'\'Temptations\'\', co-written with Patricia Romanowski, chronicling the careers of the group from the Primes/Distants days and focusing on the lives of Williams and Melvin Franklin. (An updated version of the book was published in 2002.)

Edwards was fired from the group for the third and final time in late 1988, with Woodson re-joining the lineup. On January 18, 1989, the Temptations were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The event honored Edwards, Franklin, Otis Williams, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks (now performing as "Eddie Kendrick"), and, posthumously, Paul Williams. Most of the Temptations, present and former, showed no ill feelings towards one another, although Otis Williams reported that Kendricks would not speak to him during the ceremony.<ref name=WR190 /> The Temptations ended their induction ceremony with a performance of Paul Williams\' signature song, "Don\'t Look Back", dedicated to his memory.

After reuniting at the induction ceremony, and much to the chagrin of Otis Williams and Motown, Edwards, Ruffin, and Kendrick made plans to tour and record as "Ruffin, Kendricks and Edwards, Former Leads of The Temptations". The tour was in fact carried out, but production on the album was canceled when 50-year-old David Ruffin died in Philadelphia after a cocaine overdose on June 1, 1991. Kendricks was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] soon after; he continued to perform until his death on October 5, 1992 in his native Birmingham.

===The Temptations in the 1990s===

Richard Street missed a performance in 1992 after undergoing emergency surgery to remove kidneystones. Otis Williams, unaware of Street\'s surgery, called him angrily about his absence. Street felt Williams was unsympathetic, and as a result, he left the group in 1993 after twenty-two years. His replacement was [[St. Louis]] native [[Theo Peoples]].

By the early 1990s, bass Melvin Franklin began missing performances due to failing health and [[Ray Davis (musician)|Ray Davis]], former bass man of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], began touring as a fill-in during 1993.<ref name="raydavis">{{cite web|url=http://vermontreview.tripod.com/Interviews/raydavis.htm |title=Ray Davis-The Original P Interview |publisher=Vermontreview.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> Franklin died after suffering a [[brain seizure]] at the age of 52 on February 23, 1995, and Davis was named his official replacement. The group subsequently finished production on \'\'[[For Lovers Only (The Temptations album)|For Lovers Only]]\'\', an album of pop standards featuring two tracks recorded with Melvin Franklin prior to his death.

This lineup would not last, however, as Davis was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]]<ref name="raydavis"/> and left shortly after completing the album. Davis died in New Brunswick, New Jersey of respiratory problems and complications of lung cancer on the evening of Tuesday July 5, 2005.

The group continued as a quartet for a short time before recruiting bass [[Harry McGilberry]], a former member of the Futures. \'\'For Lovers Only\'\' would also be the last contribution for lead Ali-Ollie Woodson; he was released from the group shortly after McGilberry\'s hiring<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thetemptations.com/v-web/gallery/former-concerts/tempts4 |title=Ali and Harry together in concert |publisher=Thetemptations.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> due to health problems:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otiswilliams.net/history.aspx |title=Otis Williams |publisher=Otiswilliams.net |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> he suffered two bouts of throat cancer in a short time. He was replaced by new member [[Terry Weeks]], who had served as his sub.

The Temptations\' new lineup, consisting of Otis Williams, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples, and newcomers Harry McGilberry and Terry Weeks, toured throughout 1997, and was featured in the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XXXII]] in early 1998, which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Motown. Later that year, The Temptations released \'\'[[Phoenix Rising (Temptations album)|Phoenix Rising]]\'\', vocally arranged by 1980s producer Narada Michael Walden, Claytoven Richardson, Theo Peoples, Tony Lindsey and [[Skyler Jett]], which became their first million-selling album in over twenty years. The album was anchored by "Stay", a single featuring Theo Peoples on lead and including a [[sampling (music)|sample]] from "My Girl", which became a number-one hit on the adult contemporary charts.

Peoples was fired from the group before the release of \'\'Phoenix Rising\'\' because of issues with drug addiction,<ref>{{cite web|last=wcao1234|title=THEO PEOPLES VISITS LEE MICHAELS & HEAVEN 600|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XAtX5ib2uQ}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Barrington "Bo" Henderson]]. Henderson lip-synched to Peoples\'s vocals in the "Stay" music video, and the completed album features lead vocals on different tracks by both Henderson and Peoples. Peoples would go on to join the [[Four Tops]] the following year.

==Musical style==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Unlike many other R&B groups, each member of the Temptations was a lead singer of some capacity, and The Temptations\' songs depended upon the individual members\' interaction as a group. Although the group always had an appointed main lead singer who dominated most of the lead vocals (from Paul Williams to David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards, and later singers such as Louis Price, Ali-Ollie Woodson, and Terry Weeks), that singer was never given more of a promotional push than the other members. Co-lead songs, with two or more of the singers sharing the lead vocals, are common in the Temptations catalog, particularly among the psychedelic-era recordings of the late 1960s/early 1970s.

===The "Motown Sound" (1961\xe2\x80\x931968)===
Following their first Motown hit, the group would alter their style several times over the ensuing years, adapting to the popular styles of the day while retaining their signature visual and vocal styles. The earliest Temptations recordings backed by Motown\'s stalwart studio band, the [[Funk Brothers]], reflect the influence of producers Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, and featured a cohesive blend of black rhythm and blues along with elements of white [[pop music]] that later came to be known as the "[[Motown Sound]]". Recordings made prior to 1966, such as "My Girl", were built around songs with simple, direct lyrics supported by an R&B rhythm section with orchestral strings and horns added for pop appeal. During this period, each recording usually featured only one lead singer, usually David Ruffin or Eddie Kendricks, although Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams each had solo numbers of their own at various times during this period.

[[Melisma]] and other complicated vocalization techniques featured in the arrangements of most other Motown groups of the period were essentially eschewed by the Temptations for a more direct, yet obviously [[gospel music|gospel]]-rooted vocal approach, in order to make the songs more palatable for white audiences. Creative control remained primarily in the hands of Smokey Robinson. Although, individual members of the Temptations periodically co-wrote some of their own songs, most frequently by Eddie Kendricks, who also handled the vocal arrangements for all of the Temptations\' material.

In 1966, Norman Whitfield changed the group\'s dynamic, moving them away from the previous one lead singer model and adding elements derived from the rougher soul of artists such as [[James Brown]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and the performers at [[Stax Records]]. Whitfield and his lyricists crafted Temptations songs with shifts of dynamics, syncopated [[horn stab]]s, and more intricate harmony arrangements which spotlighted each singer\'s unique vocal range. Onstage, this change was reflected in the group\'s use of a custom-made four-headed microphone stand, invented by David Ruffin, which allowed each member freedom to perform without having to all crowd around one or two microphones. Under Whitfield\'s control, the Temptations retained their white pop appeal, but also gained popularity amongst black audiences as well.

===Psychedelic and cinematic soul (1968\xe2\x80\x931973)===
When David Ruffin was replaced by Dennis Edwards, and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] became popular, Whitfield again restructured the Temptations\' sound, this time driving the group almost completely into a "psychedelic soul"-type sound. However, ballads in the traditional style of the group were still being recorded as B-sides and album fillers, with the lone exception being "Just My Imagination".

Most other recordings from this period in 1968\xe2\x80\x931970 such as "Cloud Nine" and "Psychedelic Shack" featured echoed vocal tracks, distorted [[guitar]] lines with prominent use of the wah-wah pedal, hard-hitting drums, and various [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] and other sound effects. The majority of these songs feature at least two lead singers and often, all five Temptations sang lead, trading bars \xc3\xa0 la the Family Stone. Dennis Edwards, whose vocal style had a rougher, more Southern-soul based sound than that of David Ruffin, was often featured prominently on most of these recordings.

Inspired heavily by the concurrent works of [[Sly Stone]], the lyrics for these songs centered primarily around then-current social issues such as [[Racial integration|integration]], the [[Vietnam War]], and self-consciousness. In addition, in an attempt to get the social message contained therein across to their audiences more clearly, many of the psychedelic soul recordings of this period were presented in mixes of extended length, often up to twice, triple or quadruple the length of the typical three-minute Motown song.

Tracks such as the album version of "Run Away Child, Running Wild" from \'\'Cloud Nine\'\', "Take a Stroll Thru Your Mind" from \'\'Psychedelic Shack\'\', and "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]" from \'\'Sky\'s the Limit\'\', all run at least eight minutes. At the insistence of Norman Whitfield, a large portion of the additional running time for each song consisted of instrumental passages without vocals. For example, the hit version of their smash 1972 single "Papa Was a Rolling Stone" was nearly seven minutes, featuring an instrumental intro that was almost two minutes, a rarity for songs of that era.

"Psychedelic soul" soon gave way to "cinematic soul", highlighting a further series of lengthy recordings featuring detailed orchestration, extended instrumental introductions and bridging passages. Often focusing on lyrics about the [[ghettos]] and inner cities of black America, these songs were heavily influenced by the work of singer-songwriters [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]]. Unlike Hayes and Mayfield however, the Temptations had no creative control over their recordings, and were in no way fond of the twelve- and thirteen-minute long songs being forced upon them by Norman Whitfield, whose contributions were the focal point of Temptations albums such as \'\'[[Solid Rock (The Temptations album)|Solid Rock]]\'\', \'\'[[All Directions]]\'\', and particularly \'\'Masterpiece\'\'.

===From funk to disco to adult contemporary (1974 to present)===
In 1974, after Whitfield was dismissed as the producer for the Temptations, the group altered its sound to accommodate a balance of both up-tempo dance material as well as ballads. The vocal arrangements began to again focus primarily on one lead singer per track, although some leads were still being shared periodically. In addition, the Temptations themselves, after fighting Motown and Berry Gordy for creative control, began to write and produce some of their own material. From this point on, the Temptations focused almost exclusively on songs about romance. However, songs about social issues similar to the recordings made during the tenure of Norman Whitfield were periodically produced as well.

Temptations recordings of the mid `70\'s focused significantly on the influences of [[funk music]] from artists such as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and Sly and the Family Stone, and members of both acts contributed significantly to material recorded by the group during this period. In addition, their signature ballad sound, reduced to filler material during much of the Whitfield period, was restored to the lush, full productions of the earlier hits produced by Smokey Robinson. After a brief diversion into [[disco]] in the late-1970s, the Temptations settled into a form of an [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]-rooted type of R&B, a style in which they continue to record.

Although the group continues to feature dancing as an important aspect of its act, as the ages of its members have increased, live shows have focused on less intricate choreography.

===Legacy and influence===

With their tailored suits and detailed choreography, The Temptations set the bar high for male soul and R&B groups of the period. Before the Temptations became popular, most black vocal groups were rough, high-energy acts featuring vocals which were more raw and dance movements which were more improvisational. Only a few performers, including contemporaries Marvin Gaye, [[Sam Cooke]], and the Four Tops, showed the refined style that would be popularized by the Temptations.

Producer Berry Gordy insisted that all his acts be equally appealing to both white as well as black audiences, and employed an extensive creative team to help tailor Motown talent for the crossover success he desired. Motown [[choreographer]], [[Cholly Atkins]], along with Paul Williams created the trademark precise and energetic, yet refined, dance steps used by the Temptations onstage. The most famous of these, the "Temptation Walk", or "Temptation Strut", was adapted from similar moves by [[the Flamingos]] and [[the Vibrations]], from those two sources, Cholly Atkins and Paul Williams crafted the resulting signature dance routine.

Like other similar independent companies of the period, Motown was not a member of the [[Recording Industry of America]], preferring to stay independent and handling their own widely varied distribution through thousands of "Mom & Pop" record stores and small radio stations. As such, hit singles by Motown artists such as the Temptations never achieved official "gold" or "platinum" [[RIAA certification]] until after Motown joined the RIAA in 1977.

During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of soul groups showed significant influence from the Temptations, among them [[the Delfonics]], [[the Chi-Lites]], [[The Parliaments|Parliaments]], featuring [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[the Dramatics]], [[Daryl Hall & John Oates]] (from 1965 to 1967 one of Daryl Hall\'s earliest bands was named The Temptones), and Motown labelmates [[the Jackson 5]] and [[the Undisputed Truth]]. These acts and others, showed the influence of the Temptations in both their vocal performances and their onstage choreography. Several more recent soul and R&B vocal groups, including [[New Edition]] led by [[Johnny Gill]], [[Jodeci]], [[BLACKstreet]], [[Dru Hill]], and, most notably, [[Boyz II Men]] in the 1980s also showed significant influence from the Temptations.

The Temptations\' songs have been covered by scores of musicians, from R&B singers such as [[Luther Vandross]] ("Since I Lost My Baby"), to pop vocalists such as [[Bette Midler]] ("Just My Imagination"), to rock bands such as [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]] ("[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]"), [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]], [[Duran Duran]] ("Ball of Confusion (That\'s What the World Is Today)" and [[the Rolling Stones]] ("My Girl", "Ain\'t Too Proud to Beg", "Just My Imagination") and Mick Jagger\'s collaboration with reggae artist [[Peter Tosh]] on ("Don\'t Look Back"). [[Great Britain|British]] rock singer [[Rod Stewart]] released a cover of "I\'m Losing You" in 1971; in 1991, he collaborated with the Temptations on the single "The Motown Song".

The lives and careers of The Temptations were one of several inspirations for \'\'[[The Five Heartbeats]]\'\', a 1991 film about a 1960\'s Motown-esque male group starring [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]], [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]], [[Leon Robinson|Leon]], and [[Harry J. Lennix]].

In 2004, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine ranked The Temptations #67 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty| work = Rolling Stone Issue 946 | publisher = Rolling Stone | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty | accessdate = 2007-02-05}}</ref>  They received the [[Lifetime Achievement Grammy]] Award in 2013.  On Saturday August 17, 2013, The Temptations were officially inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|R&B Music Hall of Fame]] at the inaugural ceremony held at the Waetejen Auditorium on the campus of Cleveland State University.

\'\'\'24-7 Spyz\'\'\' (pronounced "twenty-four-seven spies") are a band from the [[South Bronx, New York]], formed in 1986, originally consisting of Jimi Hazel (real name, Wayne K. Richardson) (guitar), Rick Skatore (real name, Kenneth D. Lucas) (bass), Kindu Phibes (drums), and P. Fluid (real name, Peter Forrest) (vocals). The band is best known for mixing [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]]. The fact that they are [[African Americans]] playing variations of heavy metal led critics to compare them to bands such as [[Living Colour]] and [[Bad Brains]]. Though they were pioneers in the fusion of these particular music styles, influencing many bands, they have never achieved substantial commercial success. After several lineup changes, the band broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2003 before releasing their first new album of original material in over a decade in 2006. As of October 2014, the lineup of the band includes Jimi Hazel, Rick Skatore, drummer Phillip "Fish" Fisher and guitarist [[Ronny Drayton]].

==Early days==
Upon their formation in 1986, the band immediately earned a dedicated following in [[New York]] due to the eclectic mix of their music. The band would switch gears from [[Motown]] and [[Soul music|soul]] sounds with lush vocal harmonies to violent [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] with ease, sometimes several times within the course of one song.

==In-Effect Records==
In 1988, In-Effect Records, a [[subsidiary]] of [[Relativity Records|Relativity]], signed the band, which, by now, included new drummer Anthony Johnson, and released their debut album, the genre-hopping \'\'[[Harder Than You]]\'\', produced by Bob Musso and Jimi Hazel, in December 1988. The first single was a cover of the [[Kool And The Gang|Kool & The Gang]] song "Jungle Boogie." Critics and fans took notice of the band\'s left-wing political stance and the unique sound of their tight-knit, high-energy music. The album sold just under 300,000 units due<ref>{{cite web | title = Adventures in Black-Rock with Jimi Hazel of 24-7 Spyz: part 4| publisher = sharemyguitar.com| url = http://sharemyguitar.com/blog/adventures-in-black-rock-with-jimi-hazel-of-24-7-spyz-part-4/| accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> to non-stop touring worldwide and became an underground hit. It remains a pioneering classic in the [[Rock music|rock]]/[[funk]]/[[Hip hop music|hip hop]] genre made popular in later years by such bands as [[311 (band)|311]], [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Kid Rock]]. The video for "Jungle Boogie" was the first video on [[MTV]] to air on the specialty shows \'\'[[120 Minutes]]\'\', \'\'[[Yo! MTV Raps]]\'\', \'\'Hard 60\'\', and \'\'[[Headbanger\'s Ball]]\'\'.

The band\'s second album, 1990\'s \'\'[[Gumbo Millennium]]\'\', produced by Jimi Hazel and Tom Soares, was once again released through In-Effect Records. The album was much softer than the previous effort, focusing mostly on clean guitar and lush [[R&B]] harmonies and grooves although it still contained elements of [[thrash metal]] and punk. The first single, "Don\'t Break My Heart!," while commercially viable, failed to receive radio airplay. Regardless, the album sold over 300,000 units once again due to massive amounts of touring and proved to be an underground success. It soon brought the attention of several [[Record label|major labels]]. The band were soon opening for [[Jane\'s Addiction]] on the \'\'Ritual De Lo Habitual\'\' tour. The tour brought the band to a new audience but their growing success could not halt the sudden departure of Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid. Fluid made the announcement of his departure during the band\'s live performance on the final date of the [[Jane\'s Addiction]] tour. Allegedly, he had not made it known to his bandmates beforehand. Johnson followed suit and, as a result of the departures, the band dropped out of a planned co-headlining tour with [[Suicidal Tendencies]]. Fluid soon made it known that he intended to start a new band named The P. Fluid Foundation.

==East West Records America==
Despite the loss of two of the band\'s four members, Rick Skatore and Jimi Hazel decided to continue on. Jeff Brodnax was brought in as the new vocalist along with [[Cro-Mags]] and Bad Brains drummer, Mackie Jayson. Jayson rehearsed with the band for a short time but soon left the band and was replaced by Joel Maitoza. The new lineup received rave reviews and the band was soon signed to [[East West Records|East West Records America]], a division of [[Atlantic Records]] headed by label president, [[Sylvia Rhone]]. The company tested the marketability of the new band by releasing a five-song EP titled \'\'[[This is...24-7 Spyz!]]\'\', produced by Jimi Hazel and Bruce Calder in 1991. 

In 1992, the band received their largest commercial exposure to date by appearing in a [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] television commercial that aired for the first five months of the year. Soon after, the hour-long \'\'Strength In Numbers\'\' album, produced by [[Terry Date]] and Jimi Hazel, was released and proved to be the band\'s most critically acclaimed release to date. The album saw the band depart from its [[New York hardcore]] roots to concentrate more on [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. Unfortunately, by that time, popular music had begun shifting away from musical dexterity and in favor of the simplicity of [[grunge]]. The album\'s single, "Break The Chains,"  received minor radio airplay and MTV exposure but Sylvia Rhone pulled the label\'s support before dropping the band altogether in the midst of what many feel was their creative peak. To the band\'s dismay, the label only pressed 18,000 pieces and allotted 2,000 for press purposes, thus making the disc widely unavailable almost immediately.<ref>{{cite web | title = Adventures in Black-Rock with Jimi Hazel of 24-7 Spyz: part 5| publisher = sharemyguitar.com| url = http://sharemyguitar.com/blog/adventures-in-black-rock-with-jimi-hazel-of-24-7-spyz-part-5/| accessdate = 2011-05-21}}</ref>

Disgusted by their dealings with East West and Sylvia Rhone, the band members began working on other musical projects. Hazel and Skatore looked to form a new band, Black Angus, with [[Follow for Now]] drummer Bernard "Enrique" Coley. The Black Angus sessions were eventually recorded with drummer and longtime friend Carlton Smith of the [[Royal Crescent Mob]]. Maitoza formed Shockhead with vocalist Joseph McCraw and Nixons bassist Ricky Wolking, recording one disc, titled \'\'Television\'\', which was produced by Jimi Hazel. Brodnax concentrated on his band, Egypt.

==The Enemy Label==
When Hazel and Skatore discovered how popular the first two albums remained in [[Europe]], they reunited with Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid, now performing as Forrest (his real last name) to release \'\'[[Temporarily Disconnected]]\'\', produced by Jimi Hazel. The album was released exclusively in [[Europe]] by [[Enemy Records]], and was followed by a quick tour of the continent before Johnson and Fluid left the band once again.
-
Alternate versions of the next studio album were released in 1996. In March, \'\'6\'\', produced by Jimi Hazel, was released exclusively in Europe through the Enemy label. The album contained covers of [[The Association]]\'s "[[Along Comes Mary]]" and [[Love (band)|Love]]\'s "[[7 and 7 Is]]." The album was titled \'\'6\'\' due to it being the sixth release by the band. In September 1996, What Are Records released \'\'[[Heavy Metal Soul by the Pound]]\'\', the [[United States|American]] version of \'\'6\'\'. The track listing would remain almost identical to \'\'6\'\' with the exception of the removal of "Along Comes Mary" and "7 and 7 Is" and the additions of "Earth And Sky" and "Save The World" as replacements.

Both versions of the album saw the band returning as a trio with Jimi Hazel on guitar and lead vocals, Rick Skatore on bass and Joel Maitoza returning to the drums for the first time in four years. Two tracks recorded before Maitoza\'s return featured guest drummer Carlton Smith of Royal Crescent Mob. Additional vocals were contributed by [[Doug Pinnick]] of [[King\'s X]] for the songs "Love And Peace" and "Yeah X 3".

The next release was the \'\'[[If I Could (EP)|If I Could]]\'\' EP, available exclusively through their fan club and featuring remixes and live performances of several songs. In 1998, a disagreement between Hazel and Skatore led to the dissolution of 24-7 Spyz.

==Solo albums and reformations==
In 2000, Hazel co-wrote several songs for a band named Crime, who were using the material to shop for labels. Skatore re-emerged in 2001, playing bass in a band named Block 16 alongside [[Savatage]] guitarist [[Chris Caffery]]. The band\'s first release, \'\'Too Brutal For Radio\'\' also featured appearances by [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]], Ray Freeman Jr, [[Mosh Ben-Ari]], Ronen Barak and [[Spread Eagle (band)|Spread Eagle]] vocalist, Ray West. After the release of the album, Skatore suffered from a collapsed lung. Despite their prior disagreements, Hazel came to the aid of his friend by performing together as 24-7 Spyz for a benefit concert at [[New York City]]\'s [[CBGB]]\'s. Proceeds from the show went towards Skatore\'s medical bills.
[[File:Loz jhazel mmm.png|thumb|Jimi Hazel with 24-7 Spyz in 2012]]
In 2002, Hazel released his first solo CD, \'\'21stCenturySouthBronxRockStar\'\' on his own label, The Gumbo Recording Company. It was followed by the formation of Maitoza\'s new band, Crown 10, in May 2003. 2003 also saw Hazel and Skatore reunite for a second [[CBGB]]\'s performance with Tony Lewis on drums. Later that year, Hazel and Skatore would announce the official re-formation of 24-7 Spyz. In 2005, the band released a limited edition DVD titled \'\'[[HMS4L: The Many Lives of Walter Rattamus]]\'\' through their website. The DVD tells the history of the band through the various incarnations and also includes commentary from Jimi Hazel and Rick Skatore.
[[File:Ronandjimi.png|thumb|left|[[Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal]] with Jimi Hazel at a show in Brooklyn]]
In 2006, the band released \'\'[[Face the Day]]\'\', with new drummer Tobias Ralph, through The Gumbo Recording Company label. The disc was produced by Jimi Hazel and [[Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal]] and was the first 24-7-Spyz studio album in a decade. Shortly thereafter, the band released a live performance from 1998 as a digital download and CD titled \'\'[[Can You Hear the Sound?]]\'\'.

In 2009, Hazel and Skatore began focusing their attention on a new side project called A.N.M. (Anti Nigger Machine). Other members of the band included [[Doug Pinnick]] (vocals), Greg Fulton (guitar & vocals), Spacey T (guitar & vocals) & Philip "Fish" Fisher (drums & percussion). Later that year, they released a four-song demo via their MySpace page. In 2010, the band began soliciting donations to fund the recording of their first album.

On August 6, 2011, 24-7 Spyz performed at the Highline Ballroom in New York City. The show saw former members Jeff Brodnax and Joel Maitoza return for a reunion of the \'\'Strength in Numbers\'\' era lineup.<ref>{{cite web | title = 24-7 Spyz Announce Reunion Show In New York!| publisher = Afro-Punk| url = http://www.afropunk.com/profiles/blogs/ap-quickie-247-spyz-announce| accessdate = 2011-05-24}}</ref> In November 2011, the band announced that the lineup would continue performing together with the \'\'Strength In Numbers Twentieth Anniversary Tour\'\' beginning with a string of European dates from late February through March, 2012. In September 2012, it was announced that the band had officially parted ways with Brodnax and Maitoza once again. It was also stated that Maitoza, Ralph and Lewis would all take part in recording drum tracks for a planned upcoming album. In November 2012, the band announced that Sekou Lumumba of Bedouin Soundclash had officially joined the band on drums. Guitarist Ronny Drayton would join the band soon after. On April 27, 2014, an image posted by the band on their official Facebook page stated that the band was on hiatus. In October 2014, the band announced via their official Facebook page that Phillip "Fish" Fisher, a founding member of [[Fishbone]], had taken the position as drummer for the band. In January 2015, it was officially announced that the band had emerged from their self-imposed hiatus with plans to not only perform select dates in Europe but also to release a single and a new EP later in the year.<ref>{{cite web | title = 24-7 Spyz| publisher = Seaside Touring| url = http://seaside-touring.com/artists/band-24-7-spyz/| accessdate = 2015-02-22}}</ref>

==Activity of former members==
Anthony Johnson reppeared as the drummer for the band Middle Man before moving on to perform a lead role in the [[Off Broadway]] production of \'\'[[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]]\'\'. He was also featured in the [[HBO]] film \'\'[[Stomp Out Loud]]\'\'. While performing in Stomp, Johnson was recruited to play drums for Japanese pop star, [[Bonnie Pink]]. Johnson relocated to Japan where he lived and toured with the band for a time. He was named as the drummer for [[Ben Folds]] during a tour supporting Folds\' solo album, \'\'[[Rockin\' the Suburbs]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ben Folds Now One| publisher = Rolling Stone| url = http://uk.real.com/music/artist/Ben_Folds/articles/374932/-related-articles-page-3/| accessdate = 2009-12-28}}</ref> In 2005, he made an appearance on the self-titled, five song release by Lost Tricks, a band fronted by actor Trevor Oswalt. He has also performed with artists such as [[Eagle-Eye Cherry]], [[Dionne Farris]] and [[Vanessa Daou]]. Johnson lives in [[New York City]] where he continues to participate in music, as a member of [[The Morning After Girls]], and theatre.<ref>{{cite web | title = Anthony Johnson Biography| publisher = taisuke.com| url = http://www.taisuke.com/anthony/bio.html| accessdate = 2009-12-29}}</ref>

P. Fluid and the P. Fluid Foundation played clubs in and around [[New York City]] but never released an album. Shortly after leaving 24-7 Spyz for the second time, P. Fluid, now using the name Forrest Thinner, formed Blkvampires. The band released a five song EP titled \'\'The Collector\'s Item\'\' through the Catch A Fire website. These five songs had previously been recorded by 24-7 Spyz and released on \'\'Temporarily Disconnected\'\'. In 2005, the [[New York City]] based band released their debut, [http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/blkvampires self titled album] compiling seven previously unreleased tracks as well as the five songs previously included on the \'\'The Collector\'s Item\'\' EP. In 2010, the band released a followup ten-song EP/DVD titled \'\'Blkcula\'\'. A five-song release, titled \'\'The Devil\'s Music\'\', followed in 2012. Also in 2012, Thinner was the creative director and publisher of a book titled \'\'The HarlequinX\'\'. The book, based on a short film and characters created by Thinner, was written by CJ Cassidy and edited by Hector Valle. Thinner can also be seen in the film \'\'Riot on the Dance Floor\'\', an upcoming documentary about [[City Gardens]], a legendary nightclub formerly located in [[Trenton, New Jersey]].

Joel Maitoza has continued playing drums & other percussion with bands such as Crown 10, Shockhead, Don Lithgow, Seventrain and Kerry Conally and remains heavily involved in session work and producing. From 2000-2006, Joel managed the thrash-groove metal act Brick Bath on the Pavement/Crash Music label. In 2007, Joel began working with French guitarist, Christophe Godin. Maitoza reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 for a reunion of the \'\'Strength in Numbers\'\' lineup and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band\'s European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Maitoza had parted with the band for a third time but would be one of several former 24-7 Spyz drummers to contribute drum tracks to the band\'s planned 2013 album.

Jeff Brodnax went on to join the band Egypt. During his time with the band, they released two albums, \'\'Drowning in the Promised Land\'\' and \'\'Soul Hammer\'\'. The singer later released a solo album titled \'\'Acoustic EP\'\' in 2002. It was followed in 2009 by an album titled \'\'Forcing Me To Bend\'\' which he continues to support through touring. Like Maitoza, Brodnax reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band\'s European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Brodnax had parted with the band for a second time.

\'\'\'Tony Oladipo Allen\'\'\' (born 1940 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]) is a
Nigerian drummer, composer and songwriter who currently lives and works in Paris. His career and life story have been documented in his 2013 autobiography \'\'Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat\'\', co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of [[Fela Kuti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/Tony-Allen/|work=[[Duke University Press]]|title=Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat|accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>

As drummer and musical director of [[Fela Kuti|Fela Anikulapo Kuti]]\'s band Africa 70 from 1968 to 1979, Allen was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of [[Afrobeat]] music. Fela once stated that, "without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tony-allen-the-veteran-afrobeat-drummer-is-shaking-his-sticks-as-hard-and-as-brilliantly-as-ever-770993.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Tony Allen: The veteran Afrobeat drummer is shaking his sticks as hard and as brilliantly as ever|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=18 January 2008|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref> He has also been described by [[Brian Eno]] as "perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=27798|publisher=www.allaboutjazz.com|title=Steve Reid: Staying in the Rhythms|first=Ian|last=Patterson|date=24 December 2007|accessdate=22 April 2008}}</ref>

==Early career==
A self-taught musician, Allen began to play drum-kit at the age of eighteen, while working as an engineer for a Nigerian radio station. Allen was influenced by music his father listened to ([[J\xc3\xb9j\xc3\xba music|Juju]], traditional [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] ceremonial music), but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums \xe2\x80\x93 feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (now [[Kofi Ghanaba]] \xe2\x80\x93 who developed a highly sought sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop \xe2\x80\x93 working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).

Allen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\'Sir\' Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, "the Cool Cats". Tony was able to fill the drum-set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers and the Melody Makers.

==Fela and Africa \'70==
In 1964, Fela Ransome Kuti invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen\'s unique sound: "How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this \xe2\x80\x93 jazz and highlife?" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti\'s "Koola Lobitos" highlife-jazz band.

In 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa \'70 band developed a new militant African sound- mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela\'s new African groove that blended these disparate genres.

Allen recounts how Fela and he wrote in 1970: "Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa \'70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play\xe2\x80\xa6 You can tell a good drummer because we\xe2\x80\xa6 have four limbs\xe2\x80\xa6 and they are\xe2\x80\xa6 playing different things\xe2\x80\xa6 the patterns don\'t just come from Yoruba\xe2\x80\xa6 [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa."<ref>Graeme Ewens, \'\'Africa O-Ye!\'\', 1991.</ref>

Allen recorded over 30 albums with Fela and Africa \'70, arguably Fela\'s best works. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of the Africa \'70. Arguments over royalties/pay, and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating, that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen\'s three solo recordings: \'\'Jealousy\'\' (\'75), \'\'Progress\'\' (\'77), \'\'No Accommodation For Lagos\'\' (\'79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa \'70, taking many members with him. \'What makes me decide it\'s time to go? It\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 everything...and (his) carelessness....like he doesn\'t care, like he doesn\'t know ...he doesn\'t feel he\'s done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.\' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\'

==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==
Allen formed his own group, recording \'\'No Discrimination\'\' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Ad\xc3\xa9]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded \'\'N.E.P.A.\'\' in 1985.

Post-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as \'\'afrofunk\'\'.

Allen returned with a much anticipated new project for his thirteenth release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, \'\'Lagos No Shaking\'\' (Lagos is OK), signified Allen\'s return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. \'\'Lagos No Shaking\'\' was released on 13 June 2006.

==Current work==
In 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]\'s compilation album \'\'[[Red Hot and Riot]]\'\' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled "No Agreement."

Allen played drums throughout the 2003 album \'\'Love Trap\'\' by Susheela Raman and has also performed with her live.

In 2004 he recorded with Parisian artist [[S\xc3\xa9bastien Tellier]] on the Frenchman\'s album \'\'[[Politics (S\xc3\xa9bastien Tellier album)|Politics]]\'\' including the popular song "[[La Ritournelle]]".

In 2006, Allen joined with [[Damon Albarn]], [[Paul Simonon]], and [[Simon Tong]] as drummer for [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]].

Allen plays drums on two tracks on the 2007 album \'\'5:55\'\' by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]: "5:55" and "Night-Time Intermission", backed by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].

He also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for "[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.

He has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]\'s albums \'\'Supermoon\'\' (2007) and \'\'ReCreation\'\' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks "1000 Ways" and "African Diamond."

His album entitled \'\'Secret Agent\'\' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen \xe2\x80\x93 Feature \xe2\x80\x93 Musicfeeds.com.au]. Retrieved on 15 March 2009.</ref>

Allen has influenced a range of artists across a number of genres. In the single [[Music Is My Radar]] (2000) [[Blur (band)|Blur]] pay homage to Tony Allen, and the song ends with [[Damon Albarn]] repeating the phrase "Tony Allen got me dancing."<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2153.html Damon Albarn and Paul Simonon \xe2\x80\x93 Features \xe2\x80\x93 Music, \'\'Time Out\'\' London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

He has collaborated with Albarn and [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] in a project called [[Rocketjuice and The Moon]] with an album released in 2012. Albarn collaborated with him again for the single \'\'Go Back\'\' in 2014, that is part of the album \'\'Film of Life\'\', released in October.

Anderson joined James in 1965 replacing Anna King, and stayed for three years as his main female singer, until replaced by [[Marva Whitney]] in 1968. She rejoined in 1969 after Marva departed, staying for a further three years until 1972, after which [[Lyn Collins]] took over from her.

In 1970 she released her most famous song, the feminist anthem "The Message from the Soul Sisters."

A single on James\' I-Dentify label by Mommie -O appeared in 1975 featuring a cover of [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]]\' hit "[[Once You Get Started]]" and [[Bobby Womack]]\'s "Stop On By" (which had recently been covered by Rufus).

Vicki married James Brown\'s right-hand man Bobby Byrd in the mid-1960s and is the mother of UK-based Carleen and Jhelisa, who both came to prominence in the 1990s with a couple of strong albums each. Vicki toured the UK with the James Brown Funky People Revue in the late 1980s and again with husband Bobby Byrd in the mid-1990s.

\'\'\'Antibalas\'\'\' (Spanish for "bulletproof") is a [[Brooklyn]]-based [[afrobeat]] band that is modeled after [[Fela Kuti]]\'s Africa 70 band and [[Eddie Palmieri]]\'s Harlem River Drive Orchestra. Although their music generally follows the musical architecture and language of afrobeat, it incorporates elements of [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[dub music|dub]], [[improvised music]], and traditional drumming from [[Cuba]] and [[West Africa]].

==History==
Founded in 1998 by [[Mart\xc3\xadn Perna]] as "Conjunto Antibalas", the group first performed on May 26, 1998, at St. Nicks Pub in [[Harlem]] at a poetry night organized by renowned visual artist [[Xaviera Simmons]]. Over the course of the next few months, the group solidified with a core of eleven band members and expanded their repertoire of original songs. For the first year of the group\'s existence, they performed exclusively at non-commercial venues such as block parties, lofts, and public parks, before securing a Friday night residency at the now-defunct NoMoore in August 1999. Called Africalia!, the residency lasted from August 1999 till April 2001, when the club was shut down by fire officials during the Giuliani administration\'s crackdown on nightclubs and cabarets. Guitarist and producer/engineer [[Bosco Mann|Gabriel Roth]] wrote several of the earlier tunes and oversaw recording and production of the first three records.

Over the next few years, the band\'s presence grew; by summer 2000 Antibalas had released their first album \'\'Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1\'\' and had toured twice in England, while continuing to play at venues throughout [[New York City]]. Recording with the group in the early days was Cameroonian drummer Jojo Kuo, who can be heard on the studio recordings of "Uprising" and "Machete".

By early 2002, the horn-driven outfit had released their second album, \'\'Talkatif\'\', and continued to tour throughout the United States and Europe. In summer 2004, their third studio album, \'\'Who is This America?\'\', was released on [[Ropeadope Records]]. Antibalas\'s album, \'\'Security\'\', was produced by [[John McEntire]] and released on the ANTI- label in 2007.

Antibalas has performed in 35 countries, from Japan to Turkey to Portugal to Australia, and throughout New York City, from [[Carnegie Hall]] to [[Central Park]] Summerstage to the [[Rikers Island]] prison facility.

The group has received guest visits from several musicians from Fela Kuti\'s Afrika 70 and Egypt 80 bands, including [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]] (drums), [[Femi Kuti]] (alto sax), [[Seun Kuti]] (tenor sax), Tunde Williams (trumpet), Oghene Kologbo (guitar), Nicolas Addey (congas), [[Dele Sosimi]] (keyboards), Ola Jagun (drums/percussion), and Jojo Kuo (drums) among others.

In the summer of 2008, Antibalas was featured off-Broadway in \'\'[[Fela!]]\'\', a musical celebrating the life of Fela Kuti. The group arranged and performed the show\'s score of music originally performed by Kuti. In the fall of 2009, \'\'Fela!\'\' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Eugene O\'Neill Theatre]], once again with Antibalas.

In 2010, the band released their \'\'Rat Race\'\' EP, with an arrangement of [[Bob Marley]]\'s "[[Rastaman Vibration|Rat Race]]" featuring Amayo on vocals, as well as "Se Chifl\xc3\xb3" featuring Chico Mann as vocalist.

In 2011, the band reunited with producer and former Antibalas guitarist [[Gabriel Roth]] at [[Daptone]] Studios in [[Bushwick]], [[Brooklyn]], to record their fifth full-length album, entitled \'\'Antibalas\'\'. The album was released on August 7, 2012, on the [[Daptone]] label.

The band resumed a heavy touring schedule beginning in April 2012 with their debut tour in [[Brazil]], performing in [[S\xc3\xa3o Paulo]] and [[Recife]], and kicked off a US tour at the Outsidelands Festival in San Francisco, followed by a tour of California. On August 24, 2012, Antibalas made their national television debut, performing their single "Dirty Money" on [[NBC]]\'s \'\'[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]\'\'. On September 11, they resumed their US/Canada tour with 30 dates in the Midwest, East Coast, Southeast and Gulf Coast, including the [[Austin City Limits Festival]]. On October 4, they appeared on [[NPR]]\'s Tiny Desk Concerts.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/event/music/162165793/antibalas-tiny-desk-concert?autoplay=true 2012 Tiny Desk Concerts appearance], NPR.</ref> The band toured in Europe in October and November 2012, followed by an Australian tour in March 2013.

In 2015, The Antibalas horn section collaborated with [[The Dap-Kings]] horn section, [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Bruno Mars]] to record \'\'[[Uptown Funk]]\'\' and other tracks off of Mark Ronson\'s 2015 album [[Uptown Special]].  They also performed \'\'[[Uptown Funk]]\'\' together on [[Saturday Night Live]] in November 2014.<ref>{{cite news | last = Rogers | first = Ray | title = Mark Ronson Says New Single With Bruno Mars \'Uptown Funk\' Is a Milestone for Both of Them |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date = November 10, 2014 | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/6312180/mark-ronson-bruno-mars-uptown-funk | accessdate = March 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = RYZIK | first = MELENA | title = Back to the Studio, With Hits in Hand: Mark Ronson\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Solo Album, \xe2\x80\x98Uptown Special,\xe2\x80\x99 Is a Star Collaboration | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 11, 2015 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/arts/music/mark-ronsons-fourth-solo-album-uptown-special-is-a-star-collaboration.html?_r=0  | accessdate = March 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Fusilli | first = Jim | title = Big-Name Musicians Get Funky: Mark Ronson once again proves he has superb taste in funk and R&B on \xe2\x80\x98Uptown Special\xe2\x80\x99 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = January 12, 2015 | url = http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-name-musicians-get-funky-music-review-of-uptown-special-1421105224 | accessdate = March 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Johnston | first = Maura | title = Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson head \xe2\x80\x98Uptown\xe2\x80\x99 to No. 1 | work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = January 9, 2015 | url = http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/01/09/bruno-mars-and-mark-ronson-head-uptown/69hzSRwLYZx83tukiRXNlM/story.html  | accessdate = 2015-03-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Schiff|first = Mark|title = Mark Ronson shares funky new song with Bruno Mars, announces upcoming album|work = [[AXS (ticket merchant)|AXS]]|date = November 10, 2014|url = http://www.axs.com/news/mark-ronson-shares-funky-new-song-with-bruno-mars-announces-upcoming-a-27617|accessdate = March 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last = Molanphy|first = Chris|title = Why Is Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars\xe2\x80\x99 "Uptown Funk!"

==Biography==
Arrington played in various local bands before joining and touring with The Murphy\'s, a lounge band out of [[Toledo, Ohio]], in 1975. About a year later Arrington relocated from [[Ohio]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] where he learned Latin percussion and drumming as well as playing with Coke Escovedo and [[Pete Escovedo]] and [[Sheila E]].

He joined the [[funk]] group [[Slave (band)|Slave]] (founded 1975) on their third LP, called \'\'[[The Concept]]\'\', in 1978 \xe2\x80\x93 originally to play percussion, then later becoming the [[drummer]] and a [[backing vocalist]]. Eventually Arrington took over lead vocals, singing on the [[hit single]]s "Just a Touch of Love", "Watching You" (which has been [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[Snoop Dogg]]) and "Wait for Me".

Arrington left Slave in 1982, forming Steve Arrington\'s Hall of Fame,<ref>{{cite book |title= FUNK The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of The One|last=Vincent |first=Rickey |year=1996 |publisher=St Martin\'s Griffin |pages=228 and 283}}</ref><ref name="Wynn">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p15477/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Steve Arrington|last=Wynn|first=Ron|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> and had hit singles such as "Weak At The Knees" (which was sampled by [[Jay-Z]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[N.W.A]], and others), and "Nobody Can Be You But You".

His most successful [[album]] was his 1985 solo work \'\'[[Dancin\' in the Key of Life]]\'\', whose title track became a [[Top 40|Top Ten]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[hit record|hit]]. The single also spent three weeks at number two on the dance charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=23}}</ref>  Another single from the album, "Feel So Real"  reached #6 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May that year.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In 1984 Arrington experienced a religious conversion, later becoming a licensed minister and, in 1990, he left [[pop music]] until his re-emergence in October 2009, when he released the R&B, Funk, spiritual album \'\'Pure Thang\'\'.

In September 2010 [[Stones Throw Records]] announced that Arrington was working with producer [[D\xc3\xa2m-Funk]] on a new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2010/09/steve-arrington-dam-funk-i-be-trippin |title=Steve Arrington & Dam-Funk "I Be Trippin"|publisher=Stonesthrow.com|accessdate=1 November 2014}}</ref> In February, Arrington did an interview with The Revivalist<ref name="http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/2011/03/02/steve-arringtons-revival-exclusive-audio-video-funk/">{{cite web|first=Boyaun|last=Gao|title=Steve Arrington\xe2\x80\x99s Revival: Exclusive Audio, Video, & Funk| date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2011|url=http://revivalist.okayplayer.com/2011/03/02/steve-arringtons-revival-exclusive-audio-video-funk/}}</ref> and told them his new album, "Love, Peace and Funky Beatz", was due out in late summer or early fall 2011.

She also speaks at length in the documentaries \'\'[[Before the Music Dies]]\'\' and \'\'The Black Power Mixtapes.\'\'

==Early life==
Erykah Badu was born Erica Abi Wright in [[Dallas]], Texas on February 26, 1971. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister Nayrok alone after their father, William Wright Jr., deserted the family early in their lives. To provide for her family, the children\'s grandmother often helped to look after them while Badu\'s mother, Kolleen Maria Wright (n\xc3\xa9e Gipson), worked as an actress in theatrical productions. Influenced by her mother, Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing with her mother at the Dallas Theatre Centre.

By the age of 14, Badu was free-styling for a local radio station alongside such talent as [[Roy Hargrove]]. In her youth, she had decided to change the spelling of her first name from Erica to Erykah, as she believed her original name was a "slave name." The term \'kah\' signifies the inner self. She adopted a surname of \'\'Badu\'\' because it is her favorite jazz [[scat singing|scat]] sound; also, among the [[Akan people|Akan]] people in [[Ghana]], it is the term for the 10th-born child.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_4_99/ai_69202784 | work=Jet | title=Erykah Badu | first=Clarence | last=Waldron | year=2001}}</ref>

Upon graduating from [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]], Badu went on to study theater at [[Grambling State University]], a [[historically black college]]. To concentrate on music full-time, she left the university in 1993 before graduating, and took on several minimum-wage jobs to support herself. She taught drama and dance to children at the South Dallas Cultural Center.

Working and touring with her cousin, Robert "Free" Bradford, she recorded a 19-song demo, \'\'Country Cousins\'\', which attracted the attention of [[Kedar Massenburg]]. He set Badu up to record a duet with [[D\'Angelo]], "Your Precious Love," and eventually signed her to a record deal with [[Universal Records]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

In a 2010 article for [[PopMatters]], music writer Tyler Lewis elaborated on the term in retrospect, stating: "The term \'neo-soul\' has been the subject of intense debate ever since Kedar Massenburg coined it as a way to market Erykah Badu\'s \'\'Baduizm\'\' 13 years ago. Given the way black music has been named by (usually) outsiders ever since the blues, the reaction to the name by artists who ostensibly fit into the \'neo-soul\' category represents a wonderful example of black self-determination in an industry that is still defiantly wedded to narrow definitions and images of black folks."<ref name="Lewis">Lewis, Tyler (September 28, 2010).

The group had dozens of [[record chart|charting]] [[single (music)|singles]] from the 1960s to the 1980s, including "[[Soul Finger]]" ([[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] number 17, [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] number 3) in 1967, "Son of Shaft" (R&B number 10) in 1972, and "[[Boogie Body Land]]" (R&B number 7) in 1980.

==History==
The Bar-Kays began in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] as a [[recording studio|studio]] [[session musician]] group, backing major [[musician|artists]] at [[Stax Records]]. They were chosen in 1967 by [[Otis Redding]] to play as his [[backing band]] and tutored to do so by [[Al Jackson, Jr.]], [[Booker T. Jones]], and the other members of the [[Booker T. & the M.G.\'s|M.G.\'s]].<ref>https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/the-bar-kays/id382848</ref> Their first single, "[[Soul Finger]]", was issued on April 14, 1967, reaching #3 on the U.S. \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' R&B Singles chart and #17 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. On December 10, 1967, Redding, his manager, and band members Jimmie King (born June 8, 1949; [[guitar]]), [[Ronnie Caldwell]] (born 1948; [[electric organ]]), [[Phalon Jones]] (born 1949; [[saxophone]]), and Carl Cunningham (born 1949; drums) died when their airplane plunged into [[Lake Monona]] while attempting to land at [[Dane County Regional Airport|Truax Field]], both near [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  Redding and the band were scheduled to play their next concerts in Madison. Trumpeter [[Ben Cauley]] survived the crash.  [[Bassist]] [[James Alexander (musician)|James Alexander]] was on another plane, as the plane only held seven passengers. Cauley and Alexander rebuilt the group.

The re-formed band consisted of Cauley; Alexander; Harvey Henderson, saxophone; Michael Toles, guitar; Ronnie Gorden, organ; [[Willie Hall (drummer)|Willie Hall]], drums and later Larry Dodson (formerly of fellow Stax act [[The Temprees]]), [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]]. The group backed dozens of major Stax artists on [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] afterwards, including [[Isaac Hayes]]\'s \'\'[[Hot Buttered Soul]]\'\'.

Cauley left the group in 1971, leaving Alexander, Dodson (vocals, vibes), Barry Wilkins (guitar), Winston Stewart (keyboards), Henderson (tenor sax, flute), Charles "Scoops" Allen (trumpet), and Alvin Hunter (drums) to create the album \'\'Black Rock\'\'.<ref>{{cite book |title=The great rock discography|last=Strong|first=Martin Charles|authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=The National Academies |isbn=1841953121|page=144 |accessdate=19 March 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DE9qW3YfHG4C&pg=PA144&dq=Bar-Kays+charles+allen&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u6xmT6jrGYeEsALX4f22Dw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Bar-Kays%20charles%20allen&f=false}}</ref> [[Lloyd Smith]] joined in 1973 and the band changed musical direction during that decade to have a successful funk music career.

In 1983, Sherman Guy left the group and Larry (LJ) Johnson took his place on vocals and percussion. Charles Allen left the group just before the group took a more commercial direction.<ref>{{cite book |title=All music guide to soul: the definitive guide to R&B and soul|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |isbn=0879307447 |page=34 |accessdate=19 March 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o552g5xRRiwC&pg=PA35&dq=Bar-Kays+charles+allen&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u6xmT6jrGYeEsALX4f22Dw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&q=%22charles%20allen%22&f=false}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Bar-Kays continued to have [[hit record|hits]] on R&B charts well into the 1980s. Marcus Price was also a member of the Bar-Kays, until he was murdered coming from rehearsal in 1984, a crime never solved by the Memphis police. The band took a hiatus in the late 1980s, but regrouped in 1991, with Alexander once again being the only original member involved. Since 1991, Larry Dodson, Archie Love, Bryan Smith, and Tony Gentry have been added to the group.

Alexander\'s son is the award-winning [[rap music|rapper]] and [[record producer]], [[Jazze Pha|Phalon "Jazze Pha" Alexander]], who was named after deceased band-member [[Phalon Jones]]. Jazze Pha produced the most recent effort by the group, "Grown Folks", released in 2012.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

\'\'\'Frankie Beverly\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Harris Beverly\'\'\', December 6, 1946) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[musician]], [[songwriter]], and [[record producer|producer]], known primarily for his [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] with the [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]], [[Maze (band)|Maze]].

==Early life and career==
Beverly started out singing [[gospel music]] in church as a schoolboy in Philadelphia. He has claimed that his first professional [[concert]] was a tour with [[The Silhouettes]] (famous for their 1958 [[hit single]], "[[Get a Job (song)|Get a Job]]") when he was only twelve years old.  However, this is disputed by those associated with the group, whose members were never known to mention him while they were alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesilhouettes.org/frankie-beverly.htm |title=Frankie Beverly - A Silhouette? |accessdate=2008-01-20 }}</ref>

As a teenager he formed The Blenders, a short-lived [[a cappella]], [[doo-wop]] group that were influenced by [[The Dells]], [[The Moonglows]], and [[The Del Vikings]]. After that outfit dissolved, he founded The Butlers, which would be the first group he recorded with in 1963. As time passed, they caught the attention of the record producer [[Kenny Gamble]], who eventually released recordings by the group.

It turned out that music performed by The Butlers did not fit into the "Philly Sound", and after some heavy touring, the group relocated to [[California]]. The unit was re-christened as Raw Soul and caught the attention of a sister-in-law to [[Marvin Gaye]]. Gaye featured them as an opening act at his shows, and also convinced Beverly to change the band\'s name to Maze.

The group\'s popularity was enhanced considerably in the UK by DJ Greg Edwards in the late 1970s and early 1980s when they performed live at London\'s Lyceum Ballroom for broadcast on [[Capital Radio]].  They are best known there for their UK #57 [[hit single]], "Joy and Pain".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Style==
Beverly\'s onstage attire (all-white custom designed and made, casual clothing, including slacks, long-sleeved shirt, and a baseball cap) has become his signature dress style over the years.

His son, Anthony, who has toured as a drummer with Maze, recently organized a tribute to his father, founding the record label Brantera as an homage to the work of Maze.<ref>[http://www.michaelbaisden.com/features/bside/frankie-beverly-and-anthony-beverly Michael Baisden Show- "B-Side Artist" page] Accessed 2009-10-24</ref>

\'\'\'Bloodstone\'\'\' is an [[Americans|American]] [[Rhythm & blues|R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|group]], most popular in the 1970s and early 1980s. The band [[record chart|charted]] thirteen [[song]]s between 1973 and 1984.

==Biography==
Formed in 1962, in Kansas City, Missouri, the group was a high school doo-wop group called The Sinceres. In 1967-68 they were backed by and toured with a large Kansas City horn band known as the Smokin\' Emeralds and performed their version of a Motown-style review which drew large crowds at a venue called the Place in the Westport district of KC. By 1971, the band consisted of Melvin Webb on drums, Roger Durham on percussion, Charles Love on guitar and vocals (born Charles Dee Love, Jr., April 18, 1945, [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Kansas]], died March 6, 2014, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]]),<ref>http://obituaries.expressionstributes.com/?m=c5e9323458</ref> Charles McCormick on bass, Harry Williams on percussion, and Willis Draffen on guitar.

After learning to play their respective musical instruments, moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. After arriving in Los Angeles, the group met their prospective managers George Braunstein and Ron Hamady. They also replaced their drummer Melvin Webb with Eddie Summers, a resident of Los Angeles, California. The managers decided to change their name from The Sinceres to Bloodstone. Later the group traveled to London, England where they achieved a recording contract with Decca Records. The original members were Charles McCormick, Willis Draffen, Jr., Charles Love, Harry Williams, Roger Durham and Eddie Summers. The first album was entitled \'\'Bloodstone\'\', whereas there were two singles released simultaneously called, "That\'s The Way We Make Our Music", and "Girl (You Look So Fine)", written and arranged by Eddie Summers the newest member. Their second album, \'\'Natural High\'\' reached the [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[Top 40|Top 10]]. The album was written by various members of the group Bloodstone, with their single "[[Natural High (Bloodstone song)|Natural High]]" reaching number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop]] chart. It received blanket airplay in Europe, particularly on Radio Luxembourg. It reached number 40 on the UK chart in August 1973 and was featured in the Decca "World Of Hits" series of compilation albums.  

Bloodstone\'s other [[hit record|hits]] include, "Never Let You Go", "Outside Woman" and "My Little Lady". Bloodstone was instrumental in the "black rock" and funk movement of the 1970s, and even had a hand in the [[brown-eyed soul]] movement with some [[Latin music]]-tinged hits. Bloodstone performed with [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Elton John]], and [[The Impressions (American band)|The Impressions]]. Their 1973 album \'\'Natural High\'\', [[record producer|produced]] by [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]], sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in July that year.<ref>{{cite book | first= Joseph | last= Murrells | year= 1978 | title= The Book of Golden Discs | edition= 2nd | publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London | page= 325 | isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}</ref> They achieved a moderate comeback in the early 1980s with McCormick replacement Ron Wilson. Their album \'\'We Go a Long Way Back\'\' (1982), whose title track reached the R&B chart Top 5, also produced a follow-up single "Go On and Cry" that reached number 18. The group continued to record into the mid 1980s. They continue to tour and perform to this day with original members Charles McCormick, Charles Love, Harry Williams and newer member Donald Brown. Bloodstone also starred in and wrote all the music for a [[film]] entitled \'\'Train Ride To Hollywood\'\' (1975).<ref> Whitburn, Joel (2004)The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\'\'.

As Blowfly, he has recorded numerous albums, mostly of [[sex]]-based [[parody|parodies]] of other songs, but also including original sexually explicit songs. His stage name originated from his [[grandmother]], who overheard him as a child singing "[[The Twist (song)|Do the Twist]]" as "Suck My Dick", and said "You is nastier than a [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]]."

==Biography==
Reid wrote and produced for artists including [[Betty Wright]], [[Sam & Dave]], [[Gwen McCrae]], [[Jimmy "Bo" Horne]], [[Bobby Byrd]], and [[KC & the Sunshine Band]]. And he recorded many songs of his own in the \'60s and \'70s including "Nobody But You Babe".

Reid would also write [[sexually explicit]] versions of hit songs for fun but only performed them for his friends at [[parties]] or in the [[Recording studio|studio]]. In 1971 he along with a band of [[studio musicians]] recorded a whole album of dirty songs under the name Blowfly. The album, \'\'The Weird World of Blowfly\'\', features Reid dressed as a low-rent [[supervillain]] on its cover.  Reid created this [[alter ego]] to protect his career as a songwriter. Reid continued to perform in bizarre costumes as his Blowfly character and continued to record sexually explicit albums throughout the 70s and 80s. The albums were widely popular as "party records". 

Many of Blowfly\'s songs featured [[rapping ]]<nowiki/>and many consider Blowfly to have been the first [[dirty rap]]per. The explicit version of his song "Rapp Dirty" (a.k.a. "Blowfly\'s Rapp [sic]") helped the album \'\'Blowfly\'s Party\'\' reach #26 on  [[Billboard magazine]]\'s Black Albums chart and #82 on the [[Billboard Top 200]] in 1980.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Blowfly\'s profane style earned Reid legal trouble. He was sued by songwriter [[Stanley Adams (singer)|Stanley Adams]], who was [[ASCAP]] president at the time, for spoofing "[[What a Diff\'rence a Day Makes]]" as "What a Difference a Lay Makes". Reid\'s own compositions have been sampled by dozens of hip hop, R&B, and electronic artists (such as Beyonce, Wu Tang Clan, DJ Quik, DMX, Method Man & Redman, Main Source, DJ Shadow, Eazy-E, RJD2, Jurassic 5, Big Daddy Kane, Mary J. Blige, Brand Nubian, and the Avalanches) but Reid has received almost no money from sampling due to signing away most of his royalties.<ref>http://www.roanoke.com/arts_and_entertainment/music/cape-and-all-clarence-blowfly-reid-s-the-man/article_199cbbb7-969a-5f52-beee-dab6b9014b1c.htm</ref>

Reid\'s daughter is former WNBA player [[Tracy Reid]].

===21st century===
After 17 years of sporadic touring and occasional re-recording of his classic raps, Blowfly signed with [[Jello Biafra]]\'s [[independent record label]] [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2005. \'\'Fahrenheit 69\'\', the first album under the new contract, featured appearances from [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]] of [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]], [[King Coleman]], Gravy Train, and [[Afroman]]. Other tours have included a headlining appearance at the [[Ponderosa Stomp]] in New Orleans and shows with [[Rudy Ray Moore]] (Dolemite), [[Devin The Dude]], DJ Frane, and [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]]. 

\'\'[[Blowfly\'s Punk Rock Party]]\'\', a 2006 album release from Alternative Tentacles, features several [[punk rock]] classics given the Blowfly treatment\xe2\x80\x94including a rewrite of the [[Dead Kennedys]] song "[[Holiday in Cambodia]]" recast as "[[R. Kelly]] in [[Cambodia]]", which features Biafra (the song\'s composer and original singer) playing a trial judge.

Blowfly completed his first tour of [[Australia]] in March 2007, and toured [[Germany]] with [[Die \xc3\x84rzte]] in 2008.  Blowfly performed at the 2010 [[Big Day Out]] music festival, held in Australia and New Zealand.

The documentary film \'\'[[The Weird World of Blowfly]]\'\', directed by Jonathan Furmanski, premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in 2010<ref name=NYT/> and received a wider release in September 2011.<ref>[http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2011/08/blowfly-music-documentary-cinema-release/ Blowfly\xe2\x80\x99s Party: Cinema Dates Confirmed for \xe2\x80\x98Dirty Rapper\xe2\x80\x99 Documentary] \'\'MusicFilmWeb.com\'\' Retrieved 8 August 2011</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Eddie Bo came from a long line of ship builders with the male members of his family being bricklayers, carpenters and masons by day and musicians by night.  Eddie\'s mother was a self-taught pianist in the style of friend, [[Professor Longhair]].  The Bocage family was involved in the traditional jazz community with cousins Charles, Henry and [[Peter Bocage|Peter]], who played with  [[Sidney Bechet]], contributing to jazz orchestras before [[World War II]].<ref name="eddiebo.com"/>

Eddie graduated from Booker T. Washington High School before going into the army.  After his army stint, he returned to New Orleans to study at the Grundwald School of music.  There he learned piano, music theory and to sight read, and arrange music.  It was at this time that he was influenced by Russian classical pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]]<ref>[http://www.bigeasy.com/new-orleans-music/bo.html New Orleans Nightlife and Music&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 New Orleans Musicians:  Eddie Bo] Retrieved on August 29, 2007</ref> and was introduced to [[bebop]] pianists [[Art Tatum]] and [[Oscar Peterson]].

Like a lot of other local musicians Eddie frequented the premier blues venue in town, the Dew Drop Inn on LaSalle Street.<ref>Stephenson, M. Watson, T. Wight, P.  (2006) "The Curtailed Eddie Bo Interview" [http://www.bluesandrhythm.co.uk/documents/bo.pdf Blues and Rhythm website] Retrieved on August 30, 2007</ref> Eddie began playing in the New Orleans jazz scene and went under the name of Spider Bocage, later forming the Spider Bocage Orchestra. He made a switch to [[R&B]] after deciding it was more popular and brought in more money.<ref>[http://www.ready-steady-go.org.uk/Eddie%20Bo.htm Ready Steady Go website] Retrieved on August 29, 2007</ref> In the 1950s he and a group of New Orleans musicians toured the country supporting singers [[Big Joe Turner]], [[Earl King]], [[Guitar Slim]], [[Johnny Adams]], [[Lloyd Price]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Smiley Lewis]], and [[The Platters]].<ref name=official />

===Recording career===
His first released record was in 1955 for Johnny Vincent\'s [[Ace Records (US)|Ace Records]].  His next release, in 1956 on [[Apollo Records (1944)|Apollo Records]], was "I\'m Wise" which Little Richard later recorded as "Slippin\' and Slidin\'".  In 1961, Eddie had a hit with the novelty dance song "Check Mr Popeye" ([[Swan Records]], originally released on [[Ric Records]]).  Eddie also wrote "My Dearest Darling" for [[Etta James]] which put her at the top of the R&B charts and "In The Same Old Way" for [[Tommy Ridgley]].<ref name=official />

In the late 1960s he recorded the renowned "Pass The Hatchet" under the nom de disque, Roger and the Gypsies for Joe Banashak\'s Seven B label as well as "Fence of Love" and "SGB" (Stone Graveyard Business) under his own name. He either wrote or produced most of the titles on Seven B records.

In 1969, at the height of [[funk]], he penned and sang "Hook and Sling" (Scram Records) which reached No. 13 on the R&B charts in that year.<ref name=amgcharts>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3724/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Eddie Bo Charts & Awards: Billboard singles]</ref>  It was his biggest hit since "Check Mr Popeye" and was recorded in just one take.  The next year saw another hit with "Check Your Bucket" on his own Bo-Sound imprint.

He produced and arranged records by such artists as [[Al "Carnival Time" Johnson]], [[Art Neville]], [[Chris Kenner]], [[Chuck Carbo]], [[Irma Thomas]], [[Johnny Adams]], Mary Jane Hooper, [[Robert Parker (singer)|Robert Parker]], and The Explosions. (The Vibrettes \'Humpty Dump\' on Lujon is commonly incorrectly attributed to Eddie Bo, due to the similarity of the drumming style with James Black).

Eddie Bo worked and recorded for more than 40 different record labels, including Ace, Apollo, Arrow, At Last, Blue-Jay, Bo-Sound, Checker, Chess, Cinderella, Nola, Ric (for which his carpentry skills were used to build them a studio), Scram, Seven B, and Swan.

In the 1970s Eddie, absorbed in the renovation business, disappeared from the music scene only to rise up again at the end of the decade with two albums, "The Other Side of Eddie Bo" and "Watch for the Coming," which he produced himself.  In the 1980s and 1990s he recorded with the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]] and resurrected his Bo-Sound label. He joined [[Willy DeVille]] to play on two DeVille records, \'\'[[Victory Mixture]]\'\' and \'\'[[Big Easy Fantasy]],\'\' and he toured with DeVille as well. He later joined up with [[Raful Neal]] and Rockin\' [[Tabby Thomas]] playing and recording under the names The Louisiana Legends, The District Court and The Hoodoo Kings.<ref>[http://www.telarc.com/gscripts/title.asp?gsku=3532 "The Hoodoo Kings" liner notes]</ref>

He bought a doctor\'s office and salon on Banks Street which he and his manager converted into an eatery for Bo\'s fans called "Check Your Bucket" after his 1970 hit.<ref>Jensen, Lynne.

\'\'\'William Earl "Bootsy" Collins\'\'\' (born October 26, 1951) is an American musician and singer-songwriter.

Rising to prominence with [[James Brown]] in the early 1970s, and later with [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], Collins\'s driving bass guitar and humorous vocals established him as one of the leading names in funk.<ref>{{cite web |last=Planer |first=Lindsay |url={{Allmusic |class=album |id=r31268 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Stretchin\' Out in Bootsy\'s Rubber Band \xe2\x80\x93 Bootsy\'s Rubber Band |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> Collins is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic.

==Biography==

===1960s\xe2\x80\x931970s===
With his elder brother [[Phelps "Catfish" Collins]], Frankie "Kash" Waddy and [[Philipp\xc3\xa9 Wynne]], Collins formed a funk band called [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]] in 1968.

In March 1970, after most of the members of James Brown\'s band quit over a pay dispute, The Pacemakers were hired as Brown\'s backing band and they became known as [[The J.B.\'s]]. (They are often referred to as the "original" J.B.\'s to distinguish them from later line-ups that went by the same name.) Although they worked for Brown for only 11 months, the original J.B.\'s played on some of Brown\'s most intense funk recordings, including "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]", "[[Bewildered]] (1970)",  "[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]", "[[Soul Power]]", "[[Talkin\' Loud and Sayin\' Nothing]]", and two instrumental singles, the much-sampled "[[The Grunt]]" and "These Are the J.B.\'s".

After parting ways with James Brown, Collins returned to Cincinnati and formed [[House Guests]] with his brother [[Phelps Collins]], Rufus Allen, Clayton "Chicken" Gunnels, Frankie Waddy, Ronnie Greenaway and Robert McCullough. The House Guests released "What So Never the Dance" and another single on the House Guests label, as well as a third as The Sound of Vision on the House Guests label.

Next Collins moved to Detroit, after Philipp\xc3\xa9 Wynne suggested joining [[The Spinners (American band)|The Spinners]], for whom Wynne had been singing.  However, following the advice of singer and future [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] member [[Mallia Franklin]], Collins had another choice. Franklin there introduced both Collins brothers to [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], and 1972 saw both of the Collins brothers, along with Waddy, join [[Funkadelic]]. Collins played bass on most of Funkadelic and all of Parliament\'s albums (with the exception of \'\'[[Osmium (album)|Osmium]]\'\') through the early 1980s, garnering several songwriting credits as well.

In 1976 Collins, Catfish, Waddy, Joel Johnson, Gary "Mudbone" Cooper, Robert Johnson and [[The Horny Horns]] formed [[Bootsy\'s Rubber Band]], a separate touring unit of Clinton\'s P-Funk collective. The group recorded five albums together, the first three of which are often considered to be among the quintessential P-Funk recordings. The group\'s 1978 album \'\'[[Bootsy? Player of the Year]]\'\' reached the top of the R&B album chart and spawned the #1 R&B single "[[Bootzilla]]".

Like Clinton, Collins took on several [[alter ego]]s, from Casper the Funky Ghost to Bootzilla, "the world\'s only rhinestone rockstar monster of a doll", all as parts of the evolving character of an alien rock star who grew gradually more bizarre as time went on (see [[P-Funk mythology]]). He also adopted his trademark "space bass" around this time.

===1980s\xe2\x80\x931990s===
Collins released two 1980 albums, his first "solo" album "Ultra-Wave", and \'\'[[Sweat Band]]\'\', on George Clinton\'s Uncle Jam label with a group billed as Bootsy\'s Sweat Band.   He also was credited for producing the debut of P-Funk spinoffs [[Zapp and Roger]].

In 1984, he collaborated with [[Jerry Harrison]] of [[Talking Heads]] to produce "[[Five Minutes (Bonzo Goes to Washington song)|Five Minutes]]", a dance record sampled and edited from [[Ronald Reagan]]\'s infamous "[[Five minutes speech|Five Minutes]]" speech.  The record was credited to "Bonzo goes to Washington" (also referenced in the 1985 [[Ramones]] song "[[My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)|Bonzo goes to Bitburg]]", derived from Reagan\'s starring role as Professor Peter Boyd in the 1951 comedy film \'\'[[Bedtime for Bonzo]]\'\').

After a nearly five-year hiatus, he had a comeback in 1988 (with some help from producer [[Bill Laswell]]).  \'\'[[What\'s Bootsy Doin\'?]]\'\' flaunted a new sound that foreshadowed the 1990s, such as the dance floor smash "Party on Plastic".   Laswell introduced Collins to Herbie Hancock, resulting in \'\'[[Perfect Machine]]\'\'.  The techno-funk they recorded featured turnables for scratch appeal, and the smoothly-stylized vocals of [[Leroy "Sugarfoot" Bonner]] of chart-topping [[Ohio Players]].

In 1990, Collins collaborated with [[Deee-Lite]] on their massive hit "[[Groove Is in the Heart]]" where he contributed additional vocals. Although he also appeared in the music video playing the bass, the bassline in the song is actually a sample of a [[Herbie Hancock]] song called "Bring Down the Birds".   Bootsy\'s Rubber Band became the de facto backing musicians for Deee-Lite during a world tour.  The Rubber Band also recorded the EP "[[Jungle Bass]]", their first recording in 11 years.

In 1992, he joined with guitarist [[Stevie Salas]] and drummer [[Buddy Miles]] to form the funk-metal fusion group [[Hardware (band)|Hardware]].  The trio released one album, \'\'[[Third Eye Open (Hardware album)|Third Eye Open]]\'\', before disbanding.

Collins collaborated with [[Del McCoury]], [[Doc Watson]] and [[Mac Wiseman]] to form the [[GrooveGrass Boyz]].  They produced a fusion of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and funk.

In 1994, he contributed to the [[Soup Dragons]]\' last album, \'\'[[Hydrophonic (Soup Dragons album)|Hydroponic]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=soup_dragons |title=Soup Dragons |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>

Bootsy\'s New Rubber Band formed this year, releasing \'\'[[Blasters of the Universe]]\'\'.

In 1995, Collins played in the remake of [[Jimi Hendrix]]\'s "[[If 6 Was 9]]," for Axiom Funk, a Funkadelic-like one-off supergroup produced by Bill Laswell and featuring (Funkadelic members) George Clinton, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, (the guitar of the late) Eddie Hazel, Gary Shider and Bill Laswell. The group released only one album (\'\'[[Funkcronomicon]]\'\'), and the song also appeared in the soundtrack of the movie \'\'[[Stealing Beauty]]\'\'.

Bootsy\'s New Rubber Band put forth the live release "[[Keepin\' dah Funk Alive 4-1995]]", recorded over two nights in Tokyo.

In 1996, Collins collaborated on George Clinton\'s album \'\'[[T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.]]\'\'

===2000s===
In 2000, Collins served as "[[AmsterJam|Heineken\'s Amsterjam 2005]]" curator and master of ceremonies on [[Randall\'s Island]], New York, and appeared with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Little Richard]], and [[The Roots]]\' [[Questlove]], in an American TV commercial for the [[Motorola ROKR]] phone.

Collins has collaborated extensively with [[Bill Laswell]] and made appearances on two [[Fatboy Slim]] records [[Illuminati (EP)|Illuminati]], as well as reading a poem at the end of [[Late Night Tales: Fatboy Slim|FatBoy Slims\'s release]] in the [[LateNightTales]] DJ mix series. Collins provided "vocal spice" on the [[TobyMac]] album \'\'Welcome to Diverse City\'\'. He also appears on Nicole C. Mullens\' latest album, \'\'Everyday People\'\'. He has also worked with the Lo-Fidelity Allstars on the album \'\'Don\'t be Afraid of Love\'\', with [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]], and with [[Buckethead]] on several occasions, for example on Buckethead\'s first album, \'\'Bucketheadland\'\'. Collins was featured in the 2002 film \'\'[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]\'\'. In 2004 he appeared on Snoop Dogg\'s \'\'[[R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece|Rhythm & Gangsta]]\'\' album and on the cover of "[[The Joker (song)|The Joker]]" on the Fatboy Slim album \'\'[[Palookaville (Fatboy Slim album)|Palookaville]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.jivemagazine.com/review.php?rid=760 | author=Misty Thomas | title= Fatboy Slim \xe2\x80\x93 Album: Palookaville | date=October 4, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-21 | journal=JIVE Magazine }}</ref>

He also performed a cover of the "Power of Soul" on the 2004 tribute album \'\'[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]\'.

Since then, Collins has also frequently collaborated with fellow bassist [[Victor Wooten]].

In October 2005, Collins co-wrote a song celebrating the resurgence of his hometown team, the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]] called "Fear Da Tiger" which features "raps" written and performed by several Bengals players, including [[defensive end]] Duane Clemons, offensive tackle Stacy Andrews, and center Ben Wilkerson.  An edited version of the song was made into a music video which features cameos by many other Bengals players. Collins appeared with Little Richard, [[Bernie Worrell]], and other notable musicians as the band playing with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] for the \'\'[[Monday Night Football]]\'\' opening during for the 2006 season. Collins was the only all star to return with Williams for the 2007 season.

He also sings "Marshal Law", the theme song of the Cincinnati Marshals indoor football team. He debuted the song on April 29,{{year missing|date=November 2011}} at half time of a Marshals home game against the West Palm Beach Phantoms.

In 2006, [[ABC Entertainment]] / [[A Charly Films Release]] released a DVD/CD from Collins and the New Rubber Band\'s concert at the 1998 [[North Sea Jazz Festival]]. Soon after the release, Collins split from long-time friend and guitarist Odhran "The Bodhran" Rameriz, citing creative differences as the reason.

Later that same year, Collins released the holiday album \'\'[[Christmas Is 4 Ever]]\'\'. This represents the first Christmas-themed album made by any member of the P-Funk musical collective. The album features re-workings of Christmas standards as well as original compositions.

Also in 2006, Collins recorded music for the animated television series \'\'[[Loonatics Unleashed]]\'\'. Collins also voiced the character Bootes Belinda in the episode The Music Villain.<ref name="Epstein">{{cite web|title=Bootsy Collins interview|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Bootsy+Collins/|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]|date=October 10, 2006|accessdate=2007-03-03|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert}}</ref>

In April 2007, Collins announced plans to begin a restaurant/club with Cincinnati area restaurateur Jeff Ruby called "Bootsy\'s."  The venue operated 2008\xe2\x80\x932010 before closing. It featured live musical acts, a museum dedicated to Collins\' musical career and Spanish, Central and South American cuisine.

In June 2007, Collins, along with [[Phelps Collins]], [[Clyde Stubblefield]], [[John "Jabo" Starks]], and [[Bernie Worrell]], participated in the recording of the soundtrack for the movie \'\'[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]\'\'.  In December of that year they (sans Worrell) went on to perform the first tribute concert remembering James Brown.

In July 2007, Collins also told \'\'Billboard\'\' magazine that he was working on a project by the name of [[Science Faxtion]] and an album called \'\'[[Living on Another Frequency]]\'\' in which he serves as bassist and co-producer along with his lead vocalist [[Greg Hampton]]. The band also features guitarist Buckethead and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Brain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051629/collins-looks-to-future-with-science-faction |title=Collins Looks To Future with Science Faction |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> The album was released in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bootsycollins.com/news.html |title=Bootzilla Productions |publisher=Bootsycollins.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>

Collins produced \'\'Junkyard Waltz\'\' by funk band [[Freekbass]] from Ohio, which was released in October 2008.

In 2009, Collins collaborated with [[Talib Kweli]] and [[Hi-Tek]] on the track "Internet Connection".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla0zZyWTjY |title=Reflection Eternal \xe2\x80\x93 Internet Connection 2009 NEW!!!\xe2\x80\x8f |publisher=YouTube |date=February 25, 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>

In October 2010, he was awarded a \'\'Bass Player\'\' Magazine Lifetime Achievement Award at the Key Club in Los Angeles.

In March 2011, Collins and his wife visited Franklin L. Williams M.S #7\'s Little Kids Rock program, donated a bass guitar, gave the children a bass lesson, and rapped with them while they played the blues. He is now an honorary board member of the organization.<ref>[http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/bootsy-collins/ Bootsy Collins]. Little Kids Rock. Retrieved on 2014-04-25.</ref>

On April 15, 2011, he appeared on \'\'[[Later... with Jools Holland]]\'\', performing a memorable snippet of funk with [[Jools Holland|Jools]].

In June 2011, Collins played the 10th Annual [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] in [[Manchester, Tennessee]].

In the fall of 2011, Collins began being featured in a TV commercial for Old Navy, in which he is making "[[boots]]", made by boots, made by Bootsy to be sold at Old Navy.

Collins portrayed a radio DJ in the 2013 video game, \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto V]]\'\', in which several of his own songs were featured.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/gaming/the-best-part-of-gta-v-will-be-the-radio-again/article14307396/ The best part of GTA V will be the radio, again].

==Legacy==
He has been mentioned in the song "[[Genius of Love]]" by [[Tom Tom Club]] in the line "Clinton\'s musicians such as Bootsy Collins raise expectation to a new intention", while "Got more bass than Bootsy Collins" is a line in the song "Rumble in the Jungle" by [[the Fugees]]. His influence in popular culture is seen in that he has been referenced by a number of television series. In \'\'[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]\'\' episode "Sooooooul Train", Geoffrey sneaks into the \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\' tapings posing as Collins, while in \'\'[[The Mighty Boosh]]\'\' episode "[[The Legend of Old Gregg]]" an alien creature named \'The Funk\' lands on Collins\' house, giving him his ability to play the bass guitar "like some kinda delirious funky priest", as well as the ability to see around corners. His song "I\'d Rather Be with You", from the album \'\'Stretchin\' Out in Bootsy\'s Rubber Band\'\' was featured in the movie \'\'[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]\'\' and on January 26, 2007, Collins gave the commencement address at the graduation ceremony at [[The Art Institute of Ohio - Cincinnati]]. [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], who cited Collins as one of his primary influences, appeared in unmistakably Collins style clothing in the video for RHCP\'s "[[Dani California]]", and Collins\' "What\'s a Telephone Bill?" was sampled for [[2Pac]]\'s "Str8 Ballin\'" track from his \'\'[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]\'\' album. In 2009, Collins appeared in the \'\'[[Everybody Hates Chris]]\'\' episode "Everybody Hates Tasha".

==Bass guitars==
His original "Space Bass" and its replacement (before recovery from theft) was made in Warren, Michigan by Larry Pless of Gus Zoppi\'s music store. The first Space Bass had a mahogany body and maple neck, white finish, and mirror pick guard. This is the Space Bass on the cover of 1976 album \'\' [[Stretchin\' Out in Bootsy\'s Rubber Band]].\'\'<ref>\'\'The Creation of the Space Bass\'\' by Larry Pless</ref>

Collins\' current signature instrument is a custom-built [[Star (polygon)|star]]-shaped bass guitar he calls the "Space Bass", built for him by Manuel "Manny" Salvador of GuitarCraft in 1998. In 2006 Collins made an agreement with [[Traben Bass Company|Traben]] to make a signature Collins model bass called the "Bootzilla".  During the 2010 [[NAMM Show]], Collins\' new signature bass guitar was released by [[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick]], a customized Infinity Bass called "Bootsy Collins Black Star Signature Bass" or "Bootsy Collins Orange Star Signature Bass", depending on the color of the stars on it.

==Bootsy Collins\' Funk University==
In July 2010, Collins, in partnership with former child actor [[Cory Danziger]],<ref>{{cite web|last=O\'Neal |first=Sean |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bootsy-collins-establishes-firstever-funk-universi,41456/ |title=Bootsy Collins establishes first-ever Funk University, declares himself "Professor Bootsy" &#124; Music &#124; Newswire |publisher=The A.V. Club |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> launched Funk University ("Funk U"), an [[Virtual university|online-only]] bass [[Music school|guitar school]] in which he also serves as [[curator]] and lead professor. Funk University offers an intense curriculum tailored for intermediate to advanced bass players as well as anyone interested in a deeper understanding of funk. The curriculum is based on bass theory, history of funk, and Collins\' own musical history given by Collins himself, augmented by lessons and exercises in bass and rhythm from guest bassist professors such as [[Les Claypool]], [[Meshell Ndegeocello|Meshelle Ndegeocello]], [[John B]] (Williams) and [[Victor Wooten]]. Enrolled students gain access to the virtual campus which, in addition to the multimedia lectures, includes a comprehensive subject library containing audio and multimedia music files, [[tablature]]s, and articles. Students participate in interactive questionnaires, polls, competitions (including track submissions), and are subjected to regular reviews by faculty members, who have designated "office hours" during which students can ask questions. Students and faculty can post or reply in the university\'s [[online forum]] (the Cafeteria).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefunkuniversity.com/ |title=Bootsy Collins Funk University \xe2\x80\x93 Online Bass Guitar School |publisher=Thefunkuniversity.com |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> Eventually, the curriculum will be expanded to include other instruments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Braiker |first=Brian |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/bootsy-collins-launching-funk-university/story?id=10704312 |title=Bootsy Collins Launching Funk University \xe2\x80\x93 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=May 24, 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>

 ****** Brainstorm (US band)

b'{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
\'\'\'Brainstorm\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] band, based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] in the late 1970s. Their debut [[album]], \'\'[[Stormin\' (album)|Stormin\']] \'\', was their best selling album, and was released in 1977 on Tabu Records, executive-produced by [[Clarence Avant]] and produced by [[Jerry Peters]]. It contained the [[disco]] [[hit single]] "[[Lovin\' is Really My Game]]", which was featured in [[54 (film)]] starring [[Mike Myers]], and won the 1978 Billboard Magazine Light Radio/Heavy Disco Record of the Year. The album also contained the radio hit "This Must Be Heaven", which is considered a soul classic, by virtue of its continued air play 34 years later. Other single releases from subsequent albums included 1978\'s "On Our Way Home", and "Hot For You", featuring [[Belita Woods]] on lead vocals.

The members of the band (on the \'\'[[Stormin\' (album)|Stormin\']] \'\' album) were [[Belita Woods]], bandleader and saxophonist [[Chuck Overton]], [[Lamont Johnson (jazz musician)|Lamont Johnson]] on fretless bass and vocals ("This Must Be Heaven"), [[Renell Gonsalves]] on drums, [[Treaty Womack]] on vocals, percussion and flute, Bob Ross (a.k.a. [[Professor RJ Ross]]) on keyboards, [[Gerald (Jerry) Kent]] on guitar, [[Cameo (band)|Jeryl Bright]] on trombone, and [["Leaping" Larry Sims]] on trumpet.  Future [[Wham!]]/[[George Michael]] [[bassist]], [[Deon Estus]], was also a member of the band for a time. A teenage [[Regina Carter]], who later became internationally known and respected as a jazz violinist, joined the band around 1978 and performed for a time with them. The [[Brothers Ali]], Jerome and Jimmy (bass and guitar), joined about the same time in 1978, these days performing in Las Vegas and other venues.

Members of Brainstorm continued their musical careers with other bands or in production. Woods later went on to perform as part of the [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective in touring sets around the world.  Sims became the [[trumpet]]er for the [[Sounds of Blackness]], which won two [[Grammy Award]]s during the 1990s.  Bright went on to play [[trombone]] with the funk band [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] for over twenty five years, and later released an album with other former Cameo members [[Aaron Mills]], and Thomas TC Campbell, known as MCB (which was also the title of their album). [[Trenita (Treaty) Womack]] performs regularly with the [[Funk Brothers]] as well as a wide variety of other artists, and appeared in [[Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film)]], an award-winning documentary, as percussionist. [[Gerald (Jerry) Kent]] has produced a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]]-affiliated self-published CD in 2006, under the name [[Kent\'s Way Overdue]] entitled \'\'[[Tone Paintings]]\'\', an original jazz-fusion guitar-based collection of instrumental cuts. He also plays guitar and bass with the [[IDMR Detroit Choir]], which choir was used in the closing scenes of [[Standing in the Shadows of Motown (film)]], singing background harmony behind [[Chaka Khan]] in a [[Grammy]] 2003 winning performance of [[What\'s Going On (song)|What\'s Going On]]. [[William Wooten]], who joined the band after the first album playing keyboards, now tours with [[The Dramatics]] and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]]. [[E. L.(Lamont) Johnson]] has released new material and has a website as well (see external links), and teaches bass. [[Renell Gonsalves]] performs with a wide variety of artists, as a skillful Latin-jazz percussionist (His father was renowned jazz saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]], late of the [[Duke Ellington]] band). [[Professor RJ Ross]] has written and co-produced a number of music projects with well-known artists in California including a 2008 CD "Face to Face".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/brainstorm.htm |title=Brainstorm &#124; SoulTracks - Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |publisher=SoulTracks |date= |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref>

\'\'\'Breakwater\'\'\' is a [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] [[United States|American]] band from [[Philadelphia]], formed in 1971. The original members of Breakwater consisted of Gene Robinson, James Gee Jones, Linc \'Love\' Gilmore, Steve Green, Vince Garnell, Greg Scott, John \'Dutch\' Braddock, and Kae Williams, Jr.

The band released two albums: \'\'Breakwater\'\' in 1978, and \'\'Splashdown\'\' in 1980. The latter features the song "Release the Beast", which was sampled for the [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]] track "Intro" in the album \'\'[[Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition]]\'\'. "Release the Beast" was later sampled by [[Daft Punk]] for the song "[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]", which appeared on the album \'\'[[Human After All]]\'\'.

==Sound==
The sound of Breakwater\'s music is normally that of slow jams, but they have been known to incorporate [[rock music]] and [[funk]] styles into their songs, much like their song titled "You". "Release the Beast" is best known by non-funk music fans, and the band\'s sound can be closer compared to that of [[Con Funk Shun]] or [[Earth, Wind & Fire]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

They were heard on [[Todd Rundgren]]\'s hit "[[Hello It\'s Me]]" which reached #5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in 1972.  Other notable appearances include [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]\'s \'\'[[Mothership Connection]]\'\' and the [[Casiopea (album)|debut album]] of the Japanese fusion group [[Casiopea]].  They also appeared on [[Frank Zappa]]\'s live album \'\'[[Zappa in New York]]\'\', which was recorded during a special appearance of the brothers (along with members of the [[Saturday Night Live]] band) at Zappa concerts at the [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]], October 26\xe2\x80\x9329, 1976.

\'\'\'B.T. Express\'\'\' (originally named \'\'\'Brooklyn Transit Express\'\'\') was an [[United States|American]] [[funk]]/[[disco]] group, that had a number of successful songs during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Vincent, Ricky|title=Funk|year=1996|publisher=St Martins Press}}</ref>

==Career==
The group was part of the "Brooklyn sound" of the early 1970s, formed from three players of the group King Davis House Rockers.  The House Rockers were a local dance band who had released a couple of obscure singles (1967\'s "We All Make Mistakes Sometimes" on Verve Records, 1972\'s "Rum Punch")<ref>{{cite book|author=Shapiro, Peter|title=Soul and R&B|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guide Press}}</ref>  The three players (guitarist Richard Thompson, tenor sax player Bill Risbrook, and alto sax player Carlos Ward) formed Madison Street Express along with bassist Louis Risbrook (later Muslim-monickered Jamal Rasool), percussionist Dennis Rowe, drummer Terrell Wood, and vocalist Barbara Wood.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite AV media notes|author=Rounce, Tony|title=BT Express CD Release|date=2005|publisher=Edsel Records}}</ref>  They along with producer Jeff Lane signed with production company Roadshow Records to record writer [[Billy Nichols]] "[[Do It (\'Til You\'re Satisfied)]]."  The record was shopped around to major labels until it was accepted at Scepter Records.  Scepter suggested the group change its name from Madison Street Express, hence the Brooklyn Transit Express.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The single was released in August 1974, and reached the top 10.  Lane took the group back into the studios at that point to record a second single and pitch a full album to the label.  Scepter agreed to the LP and to Roadshow Records having its own label within Scepter Records.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The first two singles were hits, both number 1 R&B releases and both Top 5 pop singles in the US.<ref name="Charts">{{cite web|author=B.T. Express |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bt-express-mn0000059949/awards |title=B.T. Express - Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref>  The album hit number 1 on the R&B album chart and number 5 on the Pop album chart of the US.<ref name="Charts"/>  These recordings were also hits in the spreading disco culture, "Do It" peaking on club playlists before Billboard started a separate disco chart, but the follow-up single sat for five weeks at number 1.<ref name="Charts"/>  They were certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] releases.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

BT Express released an album per year through 1978.  With the third album, Leslie Ming was brought in as drummer and keyboardist Michael Jones was added as keyboardist.  Jamal, who had converted to the Muslim faith, gave Jones the name [[Kashif]] Saleem, which he used after departing the group, in 1979, to pursue producing ("Mighty M Productions" with Morrie Brown and Paul Laurence Jones) and solo recording ventures.  That year songwriter [[Billy Nichols]] and drummer Leslie Ming also departed the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billynicholsmusic.com/ |title=Billy Nichols Music |publisher=Billy Nichols Music |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref>  In 1976 Scepter records was experiencing business difficulties that soon ended the company, and BT Express was given a distribution deal with Columbia Records, which, though it gave them greater exposure, resulted in less attention being paid to their production, since they had so many acts to concentrate on.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  The group did not achieve the level of radio or sales success on Columbia that they had on the more nurturing but by-then defunct Scepter.  They stayed with Columbia for five  years, with Lane producing through 1978, then Nichols producing their fifth album before he departed for solo work, and Morrie Brown producing the sixth LP and several follow-up tracks.  The group switched labels to Coast To Coast Records for the 1982 LP, to Earthtone Records for a later 1982 single, and to manager King Davis\' own label in 1985.

==Biography==

===Five Stairsteps===
As a member of the Five Stairsteps, Burke wrote the group\'s first minor hit "You Waited Too Long" in 1966, but the group would see their biggest success with the million-selling song "O-o-h Child" in 1970. The group went on to sign with [[George Harrison]]\'s [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1975, and had their next hit with the Burke-penned "From Us to You", from their 1976 album \'\'2nd Resurrection\'\'. The group disbanded soon after.

===Solo career and session work===
Skilled as a [[guitarist]] and [[bassist]], Burke continued to work for the Dark Horse label as a session musician, while burgeoning a solo career of his own. In 1977, he released his self-titled debut album, which featured the songs "Keep on Singing", "Shuffle", and "From Me to You".

During this period he contributed instrumentation to songs by a diverse range of artists such as [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Terry Callier]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Gladys Knight]].

In 1981, \'\'Changes\'\', Burke\'s best-selling album to date, was released, containing the singles "Hang Tight" and his signature hit "Rising to the Top"\xe2\x80\x94a big success in Chicago. The song has become a popular sampling choice for [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artists, having been borrowed by artists such as [[Doug E Fresh]] ("Keep Risin To The Top"), [[Big Daddy Kane]] ("Smooth Operator"), [[LL Cool J]] ("Around the Way Girl"), [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] ("Take You There"), [[Mary J. Blige]] ("Love No Limit"), [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]] ("Born 2 Live"), [[Sean Price]] ("Sabado Gigante") and once again by LL Cool J for the song "[[Paradise (song)|Paradise]]", with [[Amerie]], though a lot of these songs have been mistakenly thought to use the bass line from the 1983 song "All Night Long" by the [[Mary Jane Girls]]. In 2006, "Rising to The Top" appeared in the soundtrack for the popular [[video game]] [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories]], on fictional [[Quiet Storm]] station [[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories soundtrack#VCFL|Vice City For Lovers]]. Burke\'s next release was the 1982 self-produced \'\'You\'re the Best\'\'.

Throughout the \'80s and into the \'90s, Burke continued his session and production work for artists such as [[Peabo Bryson]], [[The O\'Jays]], [[The Jones Girls]] and [[Keith Sweat]], and in 1998 released his last album to date \'\'Nothin\' but Love\'\', containing the hit "Indigenous Love", which was popular in the [[United Kingdom]] via the [[Expansion Records]] Label.

\'\'\'Bobby Howard Byrd\'\'\' (August 15, 1934 \xe2\x80\x93 September 12, 2007), better known as \'\'\'Bobby Byrd\'\'\', was an [[United States|American]] [[R&B]]/[[Soul music|soul]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[bandleader]], [[Artists and repertoire|talent scout]], [[record producer]], and [[musician]], who played an integral and important part in the development of [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] music in association with [[James Brown]]. Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown\'s joining the group; their agent later changed it to [[The Famous Flames]]. Byrd was the actual founder of The Flames and credited with the discovery of [[James Brown]]. As one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]]\'s Pioneer Award. Byrd helped to inspire the musical aspirations of James Brown, who launched his career with Byrd.

==Early life and career==
Byrd was born in [[Toccoa, Georgia]], to a religiously devout family, where they were respected members of the church congregation and active in their neighborhood there.<ref>Cliff White:  \'\'You Know He Got Soul," Polygram sleevenotes (1995).</ref> Byrd started being active in his local church choir with the group, the Zioneers, later making a name for himself as member of the Gospel Starlighters, which included his sister Sarah. At a time when church elders disapproved of secular singing, the band members would leave state and perform in South Carolina as the R&B group the Avons, eventually they left gospel behind and went on as the Avons. The original group consisted of Byrd, who played piano, organ and sang lead vocals; and Nafloyd Scott, Fred Pulliam and Doyle Oglesby.

==Meeting James Brown and the formation of The Famous Flames==
{{main|The Famous Flames}}
In 1952 Bobby Byrd was playing baseball against the inmates of the Alto Reformatory prison team and met [[James Brown]] who was serving time there on robbery charges. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd\'s family to oversee Brown\'s parole.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/14/AR2007091402400.html |title=Bobby Byrd, 73; Musician Credited In Igniting Career Of James Brown |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2007-09-15|accessdate=2013-01-04 |first=Adam |last=Bernstein}}</ref>
It began a personal and professional association that lasted until 1973 and although Byrd had twenty years plus as a solo performer it is his association with Brown for which he is chiefly remembered. Contrary to belief, the group had already changed its name to the Flames when Brown, who had brief careers as a boxer and a player in a semi-professional baseball team after his parole, asked Byrd for a spot in the group, with Brown first settling as a drummer. Eventually Brown was driven to perform as lead singer as he felt lead vocalists got more attention from women. Byrd recognized early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him: "I didn\'t need him in competition, I needed him with me, that\'s why I worked so hard to get him over to my group." <ref>Cliff White: \'\'You Know He Got Soul,\'\' Polygram sleevenotes (1995)</ref> In 1956, Clint Brantley signed on as the group\'s manager. With Johnny Terry and Nash Knox on board, the group became "The Famous Flames" under Brantley\'s suggestion and won them a deal with [[Ralph Bass]]\' [[Federal Records|Federal]] label, which was a subsidiary of [[Syd Nathan]]\'s [[King Records (USA)|King]] label, in February 1956. Their first record, "[[Please, Please, Please]]," which Byrd said he wrote with Johnny Terry, featured a lead vocal by [[James Brown]] and was issued with the billing, "James Brown and the Famous Flames," which did not go well with the rest of the group. After three sessions, the original Flames broke up. At the final session Byrd and Brown wrote the rhythm and blues dancer "Can\'t Be the Same," which was one of many collaborations with Brown for which Byrd failed to gain credit.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The Flames without Brown changed their name to Byrd\'s Drops of Joy but found the going tough so that when Brown approached them to reform the Flames they agreed. The power within the group was now with James Brown. At this point The Famous Flames became a straight vocal group, since Brown had begun to employ the old J.C. Davis outfit as his road band. Original Flames members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new Flames members [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]] and [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth]] were added. Along with Brown, these four men comprised the longest-lasting lineup of The Famous Flames. Original Flames guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned and was added to the band.The rest of the original Flames faded into obscurity.

With this lineup the group would have a series of hits between 1959 and 1964 and participated on many of the albums that helped to bring R&B to a crossover audience, including the landmark million-selling 1963 live album, \'\'[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]].\'\' Byrd and the Famous Flames also appeared together on a couple of appearances on \'\'[[The Ed Sullivan Show]],\'\' made a brief appearance in the film, \'\'[[Ski Party]]\'\' and upstaged headliners [[The Rolling Stones]] on the landmark  1964 rock concert/motion picture, \'\'[[The T.A.M.I. Show]].\'\' Byrd (and fellow Famous Flame [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]]) were credited as songwriters on the Flames hit, "[[Lost Someone]]," though Brown was the only member who sung on the recording. Its success led Brown to record more songs on his own but the majority of his early hits were as a member of the Famous Flames including songs such as "[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me]]," "[[I\'ll Go Crazy (James Brown song)|I\'ll Go Crazy]]," "[[Bewildered]]," "[[Think (The "5" Royales song)|Think]]," "[[Baby, You\'re Right]]," "[[I Don\'t Mind (James Brown song)|I Don\'t Mind]]," "[[Shout and Shimmy]]," and "[[Oh Baby, Don\'t You Weep]]." As was the case with some recordings, the Famous Flames were often not credited on album covers though ironically enough on recordings in which Brown appeared by himself, the group was credited, leaving fans to erroneously believe the Famous Flames was actually Brown\'s backing band, instead of the [[List of vocal groups|singing group]] that they actually were. The group continued performing together until 1968 when they left over monetary issues. The last Flames-associated recording to be released was the pre-funk soul hit, "[[Licking Stick - Licking Stick]]", to which Byrd contributed vocals, without the other members, who had departed before Byrd did that summer.

==Solo career and continual work with Brown==
After two years away, Byrd reunited with Brown in 1970. He hired, on the spot and without rehearsal, [[Bootsy Collins]], Bootsy\'s brother [[Catfish Collins|Catfish]], and their band to fill in for Brown\'s former band after they left him before a gig. After that performance, Byrd and Brown brought the band to a studio session where they recorded the seminal funk hit, "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]", which Brown and Byrd co-wrote and shared lead vocals on, though the recording was issued as a James Brown solo recording.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

When The Famous Flames were still together, Byrd and Brown co-formed the production company, Fair Deal, to distribute The Famous Flames\' recordings \xe2\x80\x93 and Brown\'s own solo recordings \xe2\x80\x93 to mainstream markets after years solely on the [[rhythm and blues]] circuit. This led to both Byrd and Brown\'s signing solo deals with [[Smash Records]]. In 1964, Byrd recorded his first solo hit, "Baby, Baby, Baby" with Anna King. A year later he had a bigger R&B hit with "We Are in Love", which reached #14. Later in the late 1960s, as Byrd and Brown together began working under the yet-to-be-named genre of [[funk]], Byrd had a hit with "I Need Help (I Can\'t Do It Alone)", a refrain later repeated in some of Brown\'s later hits.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1971, when Brown signed with [[Polydor Records]], he and Byrd formed the label, [[People Records]], and issued several records by other artists, including Byrd himself, who recorded the funk hit, "[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]". Byrd appeared onstage with Brown from 1970 until leaving his band again in 1973 due to a combination of issues, including uncredited compositions on some Brown hits, Brown\'s issues with singer [[Vicki Anderson]], whom Byrd eventually married and remained with until his death, and wanting to start a family with Anderson. Though he remained in contact with Brown following this final split, this departure ended Byrd\'s 21-year professional association with Brown, who had now gone by the nickname, "Godfather of Soul", after composing the soundtrack to the film, \'\'[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]\'\'. Without Byrd\'s help, however, Brown began struggling with production of the music on People and soon began experiencing financial troubles; Brown\'s recording success started dwindling as Brown\'s other band mates left for better opportunities.{{citation needed|date =September 2014}}

In 1993, Byrd recorded a solo album, \'\'On the Move\'\', on the [[Germany|German]] [[record Label]], Soulciety Records. After a few more live performances, Byrd decided to retire in 1996, though he occasionally re-emerged sometimes by the assistance of Brown: following his parole from drug and weapons charges in 1991, Brown hired Byrd to join him on stage for his pay-per-view 1992 concert. Byrd would occasionally perform for Brown in some venues. They would also collaborate on the song "Killing Is Out, School Is In" from Brown\'s final studio album, 2002\'s "The Next Step." At his funeral in December 2006, Byrd sung "Sex Machine" with Brown\'s other band mates paying homage to his late estranged friend and former performing partner.

In 2003, a few years prior to his death, Bobby, his wife Vicki, and Famous Flames Bobby Bennett and Lloyd Stallworth, sued lead singer James Brown and Universal Music for non-payment of royalties stating that monies that rightfully belong to them for numerous Famous Flames hits, and Byrd\'s hit "I Know You Got Soul," which was sampled by numerous rappers, including [[Eric B. & Rakim]], were sent by Universal to James Brown instead, who allegedly subsequently kept them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/doowopcafe/message/12245 |title=Yahoo!

However, rapper Jay-Z, who sampled Byrd\'s song "I\'m Not to Blame" for his recording, "You Don\'t Know," off his 2001 multi million-selling \'\'[[The Blueprint]],\'\' paid Byrd 65% of the royalties for the song, allowing Byrd and his family to secure a mortgage for their home, which was worth about $250,000.

==Personal life==
After splitting from Brown in 1973, Byrd and [[Vicki Anderson]], who left Brown\'s band at the same time as Byrd, married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=800&bih=485&tbm=isch&tbnid=T4s8EapkhXVdiM:&imgrefurl=http://davidcorio.com/photos/438-bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-london-uk-july-16-1987&docid=jJW0DrRHm9oWBM&imgurl=http://davidcorio.com/system/images/438/slideshow/bobby-byrd-vicki-anderson-02.jpg%253F1313249134&w=380&h=254&ei=-wjsT-CcDOHq2AWMxOHSAQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=102&vpy=153&dur=2058&hovh=183&hovw=275&tx=255&ty=75&sig=100011542216889892090&page=1&tbnh=134&tbnw=199&start=0&ndsp=8&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:76 |title=Google Image Result|publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://supersoulsound.com/jbsuperfan/?p=1755 |title=Bobby Byrd and Vicki Anderson publicity photos &#124; The James Brown SuperFan Club |publisher=Supersoulsound.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Byrd raised Anderson\'s daughter [[Carleen Anderson|Carleen]] sons Bartlett Anderson, James Byrd and Anthony Byrd, and shared a daughter, Keisha Byrd. The couple remained married throughout Byrd\'s lifetime. Though he had moved to Cincinnati after the Famous Flames signed with Federal/King, Byrd retained residences in Georgia and after leaving Brown, settled at [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]] for the remainder of his life.

===Death===
Bobby Byrd died on September 12, 2007 of cancer; he was 73.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049294/james-brown-colleague-bobby-byrd-dies-at-73 |title=James Brown Colleague Bobby Byrd Dies At 73 |publisher=\'\'Billboard\'\' |date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Isaac |first=Mike |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/09/soul-great-bobby-byrd-dead-at-73.html |title=Soul great Bobby Byrd dead at 73 |publisher=\'\'Paste\'\' magazine |date=September 13, 2007|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/gallery/entertainment/music/bobbybyrd0912/gxH5/#2311946 |title=Bobby Byrd, James Brown collaborator, dead at 73 |publisher=www.accessatlanta.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Numerous songs in [[rap music|rap]] music over the years used Byrd-associated songs such as "[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]," "[[Think (About It)|Think About It]]" (his screaming voice in the song \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s the one saying "Yeah!" followed by James Brown\'s "Woo!" ([[Yeah! Woo!]]) and his words in the song "you bet it ain\'t" were sampled), "[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]," "[[Soul Power]]," "[[Make It Funky]]" and "I\'m Not to Blame" amongst others. Byrd\'s music has had a lasting influence on numerous soul, R&B, rap, and hip-hop artists.

For years following his departure from Brown, several history revisionists{{who|date=January 2012}} have sometimes neglected to mention Byrd\'s impact in Brown\'s career even suggesting that Brown had started out as a solo artist when the record, "Please, Please, Please" was released in 1956. In truth, however, it was actually a recording by the Famous Flames. It was, in fact, Bobby Byrd and The Famous Flames who launched Brown\'s career, not the other way around. Indeed, the majority of Brown\'s early recordings between 1956 and 1962 were not solo recordings, but as a member of the Famous Flames, which made his 1986 solo induction to the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] controversial, as his first official solo recording was the cover of the instrumental R&B standard, "[[Night Train (Forrest, Simpkins, and Washington song)|Night Train]]." Though the late 1961 recording, "[[Lost Someone]]," was sung by Brown alone, the song was credited as a Famous Flames recording and featured Byrd and fellow member Lloyd Stallworth as co-writers, and Byrd also played organ on the recording.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In addition, claims made by uninformed individuals such as pop music writers and critics that the Famous Flames were a "band" or were backup musicians are also incorrect. The Famous Flames were a [[List of vocal groups|singing group]]. The "back-up band" was the James Brown Orchestra; a totally separate entity from The Famous Flames.

The early songs, most of which Byrd participated with the exception of "Try Me," featured Byrd and contributed a great deal to establishing Brown\'s career before he finally became a full-fledged solo artist with the release of "Papa\'s Got a Brand New Bag" in 1965. Though Brown asserted himself as the full-fledged leader, he was still just a member of the Flames until that group left him in 1968. In addition, it was Byrd who later saved Brown\'s career numerous times, starting with him returning to the Famous Flames at Brown\'s request after the group\'s initial breakup in 1957, helping him to coach the re-formed group, re-joining them at that point, and later hiring Bootsy and Phelps Collins to back Brown up in 1970 and who co-produced the hit recording, "Sex Machine," later helping with other artists{{who|date=January 2013}} on People Records. In the Famous Flames\' Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, Byrd is regarded as "one of the more important auxiliary figures in the career of a major artist in music history."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography | publisher = Rock & Roll Hall of Fame & Museum |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2004 Bobby Byrd\'s songs "I Know You Got Soul" and "Hot Pants" were featured on the \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]\'\' [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|soundtrack]], playing on fictional [[radio station]] [[Master Sounds 98.3]]. In September 2005 his song "Try It Again" appeared on the soundtrack of \'\'[[Indigo Prophecy]].\'

Byrd was portrayed by actor [[Nelsan Ellis]] in the 2014 James Brown bio film \'\'[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.getonupmovie.com/ |title=Get On Up |publisher=Getonupmovie.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>

==Induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and initial controversy==
In 1986, the first committee of the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] announced that Brown, The Famous Flames\' lead singer, would be inducted among nine other legendary musicians. However, the committee failed to include the other original Famous Flames, including Byrd, Johnny Terry, [[Bobby Bennett (The Famous Flames)|Bobby Bennett]], and [[Baby Lloyd Stallworth|Lloyd Stallworth]], leading to a controversy that lasted more than 25 years and puzzled longtime fans of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://longshotsblues.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/saturday-soul-check-james-brown |title=Saturday " Soul " Check ~ James Brown &#124; Longshot\'s Blog |publisher=Longshotsblues.wordpress.com |date=2010-12-04 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> In late 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame formed a special committee to discuss several pioneering groups they felt deserved to be inducted that were not initially inducted with their front men. This committee\'s decision led to their automatically inducting The Famous Flames, including group founder Byrd, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame without a need for nomination or voting, under the premise that they should have been inducted with Brown back in 1986, since, according to Rock Hall CEO Terry Stewart, Brown\'s first solo recording missed the 25-year criterion for performing musicians. Byrd, Stallworth (c. 2001), and Terry had long been deceased by this point, and Bobby Bennett, the only surviving member, accepted the honor on behalf of the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/the_famous_flames_james_brown.html |title=The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012) |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-famous-flames/bio/ |title=The Famous Flames Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDTJaDUaoVM |title=2012 Hall of Fame Inductee Bobby Bennett of The Famous Flames |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}</ref> Less than one year after The Famous Flames\' induction, Bennett himself died on January 18, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Rock |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/9308_remembering-bobby-bennett-the-famous-flames-dies/ |title=Remembering Bobby Bennett of the Famous Flames &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref>

\'\'\'Donaldson Toussaint L\'Ouverture Byrd II\'\'\' (December 9, 1932&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 February 4, 2013) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues trumpeter. A sideman for many other jazz musicians of his generation, Byrd was best known as one of the only [[bebop]] jazz musicians who successfully pioneered the funk and soul genres while simultaneously remaining a jazz artist. As a bandleader, Byrd is also notable for his influential role in the early career of renowned keyboard player and composer [[Herbie Hancock]].

==Biography==

===Early life & career===
Byrd attended [[Cass Technical High School]]. He performed with [[Lionel Hampton]] before finishing high school. After playing in a military band during a term in the [[United States Air Force]], he obtained a bachelor\'s degree in music from [[Wayne State University]] and a master\'s degree from [[Manhattan School of Music]]. While still at the Manhattan School, he joined [[Art Blakey]]\'s [[Jazz Messengers]], as replacement for [[Clifford Brown]]. In 1955, he recorded with [[Gigi Gryce]] [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Mal Waldron]]. After leaving the Jazz Messengers in 1956, he performed with many leading jazz musicians of the day, including [[John Coltrane]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and later [[Herbie Hancock]]. Byrd\'s first regular group was a quintet that he co-led from 1958\xe2\x80\x9361 with baritone saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]], an ensemble whose hard-driving performances are captured "live" on \'\'[[At the Half Note Cafe]]\'\'.

Byrd\'s 1961 LP \'\'[[Royal Flush (album)|Royal Flush]]\'\' marked the Blue Note debut for Herbie Hancock, who came to wider attention with Byrd\'s successful 1962 album \'\'[[Free Form]]\'\', and these albums also featured the first recordings of Hancock\'s original compositions. Hancock has credited Byrd as a key influence in his early career, recounting that he took the young pianist "under his wings" when he was a struggling musician newly arrived in New York, even letting him sleep on a hide-a-bed in his Bronx apartment for several years:

:"He was the first person to let me be a permanent member of an internationally known band. He has always nurtured and encouraged young musicians. He\'s a born educator, it seems to be in his blood, and he really tried to encourage the development of creativity."

Hancock also recalled that Byrd helped him in many other ways: he encouraged Hancock to make his debut album for Blue Note, connected him with [[Mongo Santamaria]], who turned Hancock\'s tune "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" into a chart-topping hit, and that Byrd also later urged him to accept Miles Davis\' offer to join his quintet.<ref>[http://townhall.com/news/us/2013/02/12/innovative-jazz-trumpeter-donald-byrd-dies-at-80-n1509994 "Innovative jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd dies at 80" (retrieved 12 February 2013)]</ref>

Hancock also credits Byrd with giving him one of the most important pieces of advice of his career \xe2\x80\x93 not to give away his publishing. When Blue Note offered Hancock the chance to record his first solo LP, label executives tried to convince him to relinquish his publishing in exchange for being able to record the album, but he stuck to Byrd\'s advice and refused, so the meeting came to an impasse. At this point, he stood up to leave, but when it became clear that he was about to walk out, the executives relented and allowed him to retain his publishing. Thanks to Santamaria\'s subsequent hit cover version of "Watermelon Man", Hancock was soon receiving substantial royalties, and he used his first royalty check of $3000 to buy his first car, a 1963 [[Shelby Cobra]] (also recommended by Byrd) which Hancock still owns, and which is now the oldest production Cobra still in its original owner\'s hands.<ref>Tom Cotter, "The Watermelon Man and the Cobra", \'\'Road & Track\'\' magazine, August 2007</ref>

In June 1964, Byrd played with [[Eric Dolphy]] in Paris just two weeks before Dolphy\'s death from [[insulin shock]].

===Electric Byrd===
By 1969\'s \'\'[[Fancy Free (Donald Byrd album)|Fancy Free]]\'\', Byrd was moving away from the [[Hard bop|hard-bop]] jazz idiom and began to record [[jazz fusion]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. He teamed up with the [[Mizell Brothers]] (producer-writers Larry and Fonce) for \'\'[[Black Byrd]]\'\' (1973) which was, for many years, Blue Note\'s best-selling album.<ref name=yardley>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/arts/music/donald-byrd-renegade-jazz-trumpeter-dies-at-80.html |title=Donald Byrd, Jazz Trumpeter, Dies at 80 |first=William |last=Yardley |page=A28 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name="bluenote">{{ Cite web | url=http://www.bluenote.com/artists/donald-byrd/blackbyrd | last=Huey | first=Steve |title=Black Byrd (1972) | website=Bluenote.com}}</ref> The title track climbed to No.&nbsp;19 on \'\'Billboard\'\'\xe2\x80\xb2s R&B chart and reached the Hot 100 pop chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;88. The Mizell brothers\' follow-up albums for Byrd, \'\'[[Street Lady]]\'\', \'\'[[Places and Spaces]]\'\' and \'\'[[Stepping into Tomorrow]]\'\', were also big sellers, and have subsequently provided a rich source of samples for [[acid jazz]] artists such as [[Us3]]. Most of the material for the albums was written by Larry Mizell. In 1973, he helped to establish and co-produce [[the Blackbyrds]], a fusion group consisting of then-student musicians from [[Howard University]], where Byrd taught in the music department and earned his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1976. They scored several major hits including "Happy Music" (No. 3 R&B, No.&nbsp;19 pop), "Walking in Rhythm" (No. 4 R&B, No.&nbsp;6 pop) and "Rock Creek Park".

During his tenure at [[North Carolina Central University]] during the 1980s, he formed a group which included students from the college called the "125th St NYC Band". They recorded the \'\'[[Love Byrd]]\'\' album, which featured [[Isaac Hayes]] on drums. "Love Has Come Around" became a disco hit in the UK and reached #41 on the charts.

Beginning in the 1960s, Byrd (who eventually took his PhD in [[music education]] from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1982) taught at a variety of postsecondary institutions, including [[Rutgers University]], the [[Hampton Institute]], [[New York University]], [[Howard University]], [[Queens College]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Cornell University]], [[North Carolina Central University]] and [[Delaware State University]].<ref>[http://www.desu.edu/jazz-artist-donald-byrd-named-artist-residence-0 Dr. Donald Byrd Named Artist in Residence], \'\'DSU Press Release\'\', September 4, 2009.</ref> Byrd returned to somewhat straight-ahead jazz later in his career, releasing three albums for [[Orrin Keepnews]]\' [[Landmark Records]], and his final album \'\'Touchstone\'\', a quintet.

Byrd died on Feb. 4 2013 in Dover, Del. He was 80.<ref name=yardley /><ref>[http://www.nj.com/greatday/stories/more.html The State of Jazz: Meet 40 More Jersey Greats], \'\'[[The Star-Ledger]]\'\', September 28, 2004.</ref>

\'\'\'Cameo\'\'\' is an American [[soul music|soul]]-influenced [[funk]] group that formed in the early 1970s. Cameo was initially a 13-member group known as the \'\'\'New York City Players\'\'\'; this name was later changed to Cameo to avoid a lawsuit from [[Ohio Players]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} another group from that era.

As of 2009, some of the original members continue to perform together, while two others were hired by the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Outkast]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Griffith |first=Spencer |url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/bassist-aaron-mills-best-years-may-be-ahead-of-him/Content?oid=1215789 |title=Bassist Aaron Mills\' best years may be ahead of him &#124; Music Feature &#124; Independent Weekly |publisher=Indyweek.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13}}</ref>
Cameo was a top R&B/Funk band in an era with notable peers such as:  [[Rick James]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], Bar-Kays, [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Ohio Players]] and [[The Isley Brothers]], and singers like [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Billy Paul]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Bootsy Collins]].

==History==
In 1974, Cameo started out with 10 members created by [[Larry Blackmon]] and called the \'\'\'New York City Players\'\'\'. Signed by [[Casablanca Records]] to their [[Chocolate City Records|Chocolate City]] imprint in 1976, the group soon changed its name to Cameo after concerns that \'\'New York City Players\'\' might cause confusion between them and the funk band [[Ohio Players]]. Prior to this, Blackmon, keyboardist Gregory Johnson, and the late [[Gwen Guthrie]] formed the band \'\'\'East Coast\'\'\', together with James Wheeler (alto saxophone), Melvin Whay (bass), Michael Harris (percussion), and [[Haras Fyre]] (also known as [[Haras Fyre|Pat Grant]]) on trombone. They released one self-titled album in 1973 on the independent [[record label|label]] Encounter.

Cameo started with a deep, funk sound, but it was obvious from the start their sights were set on the dance floor. Their first album was \'\'[[Cardiac Arrest (album)|Cardiac Arrest]]\'\'. The first hit single "[[Rigor Mortis (song)|Rigor Mortis]]" was the start of Cameo\'s hit-studded career; it went [[gold record|gold]]. \'\'[[Ugly Ego]]\'\', \'\'[[We All Know Who We Are]]\'\', and \'\'[[Secret Omen]]\'\' contained dance floor songs such as "I Just Want To Be" and "Find My Way", the latter of which was a major [[disco]] smash and was included on the soundtrack to \'\'[[Thank God It\'s Friday]]\'\'.  But the sleeper hit in the movie was [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078382/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd "It\'s Serious"].

The height of Cameo\'s career was in the 1980s, particularly \'\'[[Word Up! (album)|Word Up!]]\'\' with its hits, "[[Word Up! (song)|Word Up!]]" and "[[Candy (Cameo song)|Candy]]". The writers of "Word Up", Cameo\'s biggest hit, were Larry Ernest Blackmon (founder and front man) and Thomas Michael Jenkins (member of the group).

==Music career==
By the time \'\'[[Cameosis]]\'\' came out in 1980, Cameo had gained considerable momentum through singles such as "[[Shake Your Pants]]". Albums such as 1981\'s \'\'[[Knights of the Sound Table]]\'\' and 1982\'s \'\'[[Alligator Woman]]\'\' saw the band playing up their eclectic style.

1985\'s album \'\'[[Single Life]]\'\', featuring the title track and "Attack Me With Your Love" continued the band\'s momentum, paving the way for what was to come the following year.  The song "[[Word Up! (song)|Word Up!]]" hit the radio airwaves in mid-1986.  Critically acclaimed with large amounts of club and radio airtime, the resulting album \'\'[[Word Up! (album)|Word Up!]]\'\' turned Cameo into superstars. The follow-up tracks, "[[Candy (Cameo song)|Candy]]" and "Back and Forth" were also huge hits for the funk trio.

Two years later, Cameo would release \'\'[[Machismo (album)|Machismo]]\'\' to lukewarm pop response but favorable critical reviews and R&B success. Kendrick left the band at this point. Next, 1990\'s \'\'[[Real Men... Wear Black]]\'\' and 1992\'s \'\'[[Emotional Violence]]\'\' failed to reach the same commercial success of \'\'Word Up!\'\'. By this time, after their departure from Polygram on to their new label, [[Reprise Records|Reprise]], Blackmon represented himself (besides his band activities and side productions) as [[A&R]] agent for this label, a division of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It also saw the absence of Nathan Leftenant, but the return of guitarist Charlie Singleton as one of "main" members. Leftenant returned again for the next album, which they released on a new label (Way 2 Funky/Raging Bull), and recorded at their next headed location, Miami, Florida. In 1994 \'\'[[In the Face of Funk]]\'\' was released and got some club play, a single release, and at least one track that received critical acclaim (for "You Are My Love").

==Present==
Tomi Jenkins, who released his self-produced CD \'\'The Way\'\' in 2005, is writing and recording his follow-up EP. He is also the music supervisor/producer on the film \'\'Icemosis\'\',  the story of a 1970s fictional funk band. The film is in music production and they hope to have the film released in 2013. He is also the author of a murder mystery entitled "Crime, Love and Honor" which he is autographing and selling at concerts.

Aaron Mills continues to tour with Cameo as well as other artists. He has worked with [[Andre 3000]] and [[Big Boi]] to record a bassline for "[[Ms. Jackson]]".

Ex-Cameo vocalist John Kellogg became an entertainment lawyer representing such hit artists as the O\'Jays, the late Gerald Levert and LSG. He also pursued a career in music industry higher education, becoming Assistant Chair of the Music Business/Management department at one of the world\'s leading institutions of contemporary music, Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA.

Larry Blackmon & Tomi Jenkins recorded the next Cameo album with a tentative release scheduled for late fall 2012 or early 2013.

Gregory B. Johnson has released 2 CD\'s on his own label, Allspice Record Co.  "A New Hip" which is a smooth Jazz CD in 2007.  "Funk Funk (Just For A Little Time)" in 2012 which is an urban funk CD.

\'\'\'Daryl L. Cameron\'\'\' (born July 10, 1957, [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]), better known as \'\'\'Captain Sky\'\'\', is an American musician and singer.  Captain Sky\xe2\x80\x99s funk-based musical style, futuristic costumes, and psychedelic imagery are similar to those of [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], and other Parliament/Funkadelic projects.<ref name=Billboard />  In the liner notes to the first Captain Sky album, Captain Sky\xe2\x80\x99s origins are explained in this way:  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way, if you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering, Daryl Cameron somehow entered the phonebooth of his mind and emerged as Captain Sky.  Tune in again.\xe2\x80\x9d

With a group of other Chicago-based musicians, Captain Sky began recording around 1978 and released \'\'[[The Adventures of Captain Sky]]\'\' in that year followed quickly by \'\'Pop Goes The Captain\'\' in 1979.  Both albums were released by AVI Records.  Several singles were released from these albums, most notably \xe2\x80\x9cWonder Worm\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Sporm.\xe2\x80\x9d  By 1980, Captain Sky had moved to TEC records and on that imprint released his third album \'\'Concerned Party #1\'\'.  After several more singles, \'\'The Return of Captain Sky\'\', his final album was released in 1981 back on AVI records.  Since that time, Captain Sky has released singles sporadically on various labels and older tracks have been included on various compilations.

==Biography==
As leader of The Jimmy Castor Bunch in the 1970s, and also as a [[solo (music)|solo]] [[musician|artist]], he released several successful [[album]]s and [[single (music)|singles]]. The group reached the peak of their commercial success in 1972 with the release of their album, \'\'[[It\'s Just Begun]]\'\', which featured two [[hit record|hit]] singles: the title track and "[[Troglodyte (Cave Man)]]," which was a large hit in the [[United States|U.S.]], peaking at #6 in the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. The track stayed in the chart for 14&nbsp;weeks and was a million seller by June 30, 1972, and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] award from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|R.I.A.A.]]<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

The Castor band included [[keyboardist]]/[[trumpet]]er Gerry Thomas, [[bassist]] Doug Gibson, [[guitarist]] Harry Jensen, [[conga]] player Lenny Fridle, Jr., and [[drummer]] Bobby Manigault.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Thomas, who simultaneously recorded with the [[Fatback Band]], left in the 1980s to exclusively record with them.

Many of the group\'s tunes have been heavily [[sampling (music)|sampled]] in [[film]]s and in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]. In particular, the [[saxophone]] hook and groove from "It\'s Just Begun" and the spoken word intro and groove from "[[Troglodyte (Cave Man)]]" (namely, "What we\'re gonna do right here is go back...") have been sampled extensively. [[Industrial hip hop]] group [[Tackhead]] covered the song "Just Begun" for the digital release of their album \'\'[[For the Love of Money (album)|For the Love of Money]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.tackhead.com/info/discography/albums/#c700 |title=Discography: For the Love of Money |publisher=tackhead.com |date=2004 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>

}}\'\'\'Oliver Cheatham\'\'\' (February 24, 1948 \xe2\x80\x93 November 29, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] [[R&B]] singer who is best remembered for his 1983 hit "[[Get Down Saturday Night]]".<ref name="AMG">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p185157/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com biography]</ref> He also appeared on the 2003 single "[[Make Luv]]" by Italian DJ [[Room 5]], which reached #1 on the UK charts.

==Biography==
Cheatham was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Encouraged by his mother to sing, over the years he joined several local groups including The Young Sirs, Mad Dog And The Pups and Gaslight before releasing a single, "Hard Times" on the Tier [[record label]].  He then joined another group, the Sins of Satan, the group later being renamed as Roundtrip.  They finally took Cheatham\'s first name and recorded two albums as Oliver.<ref name=soulwalking>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Oliver%20Cheatham.html  Oliver Cheatham biography at Soulwalking.co.uk]. Retrieved 1 December 2013</ref>  

Cheatham then signed for [[MCA Records]] as a solo singer.  He worked with Al Hudson of the band [[One Way (American band)|One Way]] on his first album, \'\'The Boss\'\'.  His first chart success came in 1983 with "[[Get Down Saturday Night]]", co-written by Cheatham and One Way\'s Kevin McCord, which reached no.37 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]], and also reached no.38 on the [[UK singles chart]].  The album, \'\'Saturday Night\'\', produced by [[Al Perkins]], was released the same year.  In 1986, he moved to the Critique label, and had further success in the US with the singles "S.O.S." (R&B chart no.35), and "Celebrate (Our Love)". Other Cheatham singles included "Mama Said," "Put a Little Love in Your Heart," "Things to Make U Happy," and "Wish on a Star."<ref name="AMG"/>  After moving to the [[New York]]-based Warlock label, he recorded "Turn Out the Lights" and "Mindbuster" with [[Jocelyn Brown]].<ref name=soulwalking/><ref name="whitburnr&b"/>  He spent much of the 1990s working as a [[backing singer]] with artists including [[Leo Sayer]], and released his final album, \'\'Stand for Love\'\', in 2002.<ref name=soultracks/>

\'\'\'Stanley Clarke\'\'\' (born June 30, 1951) is an American [[jazz]] musician and composer known for his innovative and influential work on [[double bass]] and electric bass as well as for his numerous film and television scores. He is best known for his work with the fusion band [[Return to Forever]], and his role as a [[bandleader]] in several trios and ensembles.

==Early life and education==
Clarke was born in [[Philadelphia]]. He was introduced to the bass as a schoolboy when he arrived late on the day instruments were distributed to students and acoustic bass was one of the few remaining selections.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke |first=Stanley |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15879188 |title=Stanley Clarke: A Lyrical Bass Player |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref> He is a graduate of Roxborough High School in Philadelphia. Having graduated from the Philadelphia Musical Academy, (which was absorbed into the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in 1985), he moved to New York City in 1971 and began working with famous bandleaders and musicians including [[Horace Silver]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Dave Brubeck]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/stanley-clarke-soloreturn-to-foreversmv/27615|title=Interview:Stanley Clarke (solo,Return to Forever,SMV)|author=thodoris|work=Hit Channel}}</ref> [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Gato Barbieri]], [[Joe Henderson]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Gil Evans]] and [[Stan Getz]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=5737 |title=Stanley Clarke @ All About Jazz |first= |last= |work=musicians.allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=31 October 2013}}</ref>

Clarke was a member of the [[Church of Scientology]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/press-releases/celebrity-centre-international-43rd-anniversary.html |title=Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International Celebrates 43rd Anniversary |publisher=Scientologynews.org |date=2012-08-25 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref> but is no longer involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themortonreport.com/celebrity/hollywood/the-giant-list-of-celebrities-that-departed-scientology |title=The Massive List of Celebrities That Departed Scientology |publisher=The Morton Report |date=2013-08-11 |accessdate=2014-07-03}}</ref> His earlier musical productions would often reference [[L. Ron Hubbard]] on their LP sleeves.

==1970s==
During the 1970s Clarke joined the [[jazz fusion]] group [[Return to Forever]] led by pianist and synth player [[Chick Corea]]. The group became one of the most important fusion groups and released several albums that achieved both mainstream popularity and critical acclaim. Clarke also started his solo career in the early 1970s and released a number of albums under his own name. His best known solo album is \'\'[[School Days (album)|School Days]]\'\' (1976), which, along with [[Jaco Pastorius]]\'s [[Jaco Pastorius (album)|self-titled debut]], is one of the most influential solo bass recordings in fusion history. His albums \'\'[[Stanley Clarke (album)|Stanley Clarke]]\'\' (1974) and \'\'[[Journey to Love]]\'\' (1975) are also notable.

==Scoring film and television==
Clarke began with TV scores for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]\'s short-lived series \'\'[[A Man Called Hawk]]\'\' and an Emmy-nominated score for \'\'[[Pee-wee\'s Playhouse]]\'\'. Clarke then moved on to work as a composer, orchestrator, conductor and performer of scores for such films as: \'\'[[Boyz n the Hood]]\'\', the [[biopic]] of [[Tina Turner]] \'\'[[What\'s Love Got to Do with It (film)|What\'s Love Got to Do with It]]\'\', \'\'[[Passenger 57]]\'\', \'\'[[Higher Learning]]\'\', \'\'[[Poetic Justice (1993 film)|Poetic Justice]],\'\' \'\'[[Panther (film)|Panther]]\'\', \'\'[[The Five Heartbeats]]\'\', [[Book of Love (1990 film)|Book of Love]], \'\'[[Little Big League]],\'\' and \'\'[[Romeo Must Die]]\'\'. He also scored the [[Luc Besson]]- produced/co-written action film, [[The Transporter]], starring [[Jason Statham]] and a [[Michael Jackson]] video release directed by [[John Singleton]] entitled \'\'Remember the Time\'\'. In the 2000s, he composed music for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Network program \'\'[[Soul Food (TV series)|Soul Food]]\'\'.

==Right-hand electric bass technique==
When playing electric bass, Clarke places his right hand so that his fingers approach the strings much as they would on an [[upright bass]], but rotated through 90 degrees. To achieve this, his forearm lies above and nearly parallel to the strings, while his wrist is hooked downward at nearly a right angle. For lead and solo playing, his fingers partially hook underneath the strings so that when released, the strings snap against the frets, producing a biting percussive attack. In addition to an economical variation on the funky [[Larry Graham]]-style slap-n\'-pop technique, Clarke also uses downward thrusts of the entire right hand, striking two or more strings from above with his fingernails (examples of this technique include "School Days", "Rock and Roll Jelly", "Wild Dog", and "Danger Street").

==Equipment==
Clarke has long been associated with [[Alembic Inc|Alembic]] basses, and much of his recorded output has been produced on Alembic instruments, particularly a dark-wood-colored custom bass in the Series II body style. These basses are handmade neck-through-body instruments made from a mixture of exotic woods and a proprietary active pickup system that is powered from an external power supply. A Stanley Clarke Signature Model bass guitar is produced by Alembic. Clarke also utilizes full-range amplification for his basses, including two QSC 2050 amplifiers, more in keeping with a keyboardist\'s rig than a bassist\'s or guitarists. To extend his melodic range, he also plays on tenor and piccolo basses. Clarke\'s are usually short scale (78&nbsp;cm or 30.75"), four string, [[Carl Thompson (guitarist)|Carl Thompson]] or Alembic.

In the late 1970s, Clarke was playing [[Rick Turner (luthier)|Rick Turner\'s]] first graphite neck on his Alembic "Black Beauty" bass, and he decided to have an all composite bass made. He commissioned designer/luthier Tom Lieber to design and build this bass, having purchased one of Lieber\'s Spider grinder basses in 1979. In 1980 Lieber and Clarke formed the Spellbinder Corporation and produced a limited run of fifty Spellbinder basses. One left-handed bass was built as a gift from Stanley to [[Paul McCartney]]. After the run, the molds were destroyed. In 2007 Clarke once again teamed up with Lieber and Rick Turner to reform the Spellbinder Corp. and produce a limited run of 125 of the Spellbinder Bass II, which he played on the RTF reunion tour. Clarke has also played a Ken Smith BT Custom, and a German made L\xc3\xb6wenherz Tenor Bass

His current pedalboard consists of a TC Electronic G-System, an MXR Bass Octave Deluxe and an EBS Bass IQ Envelope.

==Collaborations==
[[File:Stanley Clarke July 5 1979.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Clarke, on tour with Jeff Beck, in Amsterdam July 5, 1979]]
Clarke formed [[Animal Logic (band)|Animal Logic]] with rock drummer [[Stewart Copeland]], after the break-up of [[The Police]], and [[singer-songwriter]] [[Deborah Holland]]. Other notable (recording/touring) project involvements are: (1979) [[Jeff Beck]], (1979) [[Ron Wood]]\'s New Barbarians, (1981, 1983, 1990) Clarke/Duke Project with [[George Duke]], (1984) with [[Miroslav Vitou\xc5\xa1]],<ref>1984 Sydney Town Hall, producer Ian Davis (ABC radio)</ref> (1989) [[Animal Logic (band)|Animal Logic]] with [[Stewart Copeland]], (1993\xe2\x80\x9394), A group with [[Larry Carlton]], [[Billy Cobham]], Najee & [[Deron Johnson (musician)|Deron Johnson]], (1995) \'\'[[The Rite of Strings]]\'\' with [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] and [[Al Di Meola]] and (1999) \'\'[[Vertu\xe2\x80\x99]]\'\' with [[Lenny White]] and [[Richie Kotzen]]. In addition to touring with his own band, Clarke continues also collaborates with other artists on tour. During the summer and fall of 2007 he toured with his \'\'The Rite of Strings\'\' comrades, [[Al Di Meola]] and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. In addition to a date in France and dates in the Eastern U.S., the tour included shows in South America.

In 2006 Clarke joined old friend George Duke for a 40-city tour of festivals and performing arts centers. This was the first time Clarke and Duke had toured together in fifteen years. The duo first teamed to form the Clarke/Duke Project in 1981. They scored a Top 20 hit with "Sweet Baby" and recorded three albums. In 2005 Clarke toured as [[Trio!]] with [[banjo]] player [[B\xc3\xa9la Fleck]] and Jean-Luc Ponty. The U.S. and European tour was nominated for a 2006 [[Jammy Award]] in the category of "Tour of the Year."

==\'\'Night School\'\'==
Early in 2007, Clarke\'s own Roxboro Entertainment Group released a DVD entitled \'\'[[Night School: An Evening with Stanley Clarke and Friends]]\'\' (HUDV-7118) through the Heads Up International label. The 90-minute presentation documents the third annual Stanley Clarke Scholarship Concert, recorded at Musicians Institute in Hollywood, CA, in October 2002. The group offers scholarships to students in financial need who excel in music. The Night School DVD scholarship concert features diverse group of musicians that include Stevie Wonder, Wallace Roney, Bela Fleck, Sheila E., Stewart Copeland, the Red Hot Chili Peppers\xe2\x80\x99 Flea, Wayman Tisdale, Marcus Miller and others. \'\'Night School\'\' captures performances that range from straight-ahead jazz to full-tilt rock fusion to a twenty-two-piece string ensemble.

==2000s==
[[File:Clarke Wooten.jpg|thumb|237px|Stanley Clarke and [[Victor Wooten]] in the [[SMV (band)|SMV Thunder Tour]] at [[Stockholm Jazz Festival]], 2009]]

Since the 1980s, Clarke has turned much of his energy to television and [[film score]]s. He is credited for the scores for the [[ABC Family|ABC Family Channel]] series \'\'[[Lincoln Heights (TV series)|Lincoln Heights]]\'\' as well as composing the theme song for the show.

\'\'\'George Clinton\'\'\' (born July 22, 1941) is an American [[singing|singer]], [[songwriter]], [[bandleader]], and [[Record producer|music producer]]. He was the principal architect of [[P-Funk]], the mastermind of the bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] during the 1970s and early 1980s, and launched a solo career in 1981. He has been cited as one of the foremost innovators of [[Funk|funk music]], along with [[James Brown]] and [[Sly Stone]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997, alongside 15 other members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

== Career ==

===Beginnings===
Clinton was born in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], grew up in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], and currently resides in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. During his teen years Clinton formed a [[Doo-wop|doo wop]] group inspired by [[The Teenagers|Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers]] called [[The Parliaments]], while straightening hair at a barber salon in Plainfield.

===1960s and 1970s===
For a period in the 1960s Clinton was a staff songwriter for [[Motown]]. Despite initial commercial failure (and one major hit single, "[[(I Wanna) Testify]]" in 1967), as well as arranging and producing scores of singles on many of the independent Detroit soul music labels), The Parliaments eventually found success under the names [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] in the 1970s (see also [[P-Funk]]). These two bands combined the elements of musicians such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[James Brown]] while exploring various sounds, technology, and lyricism. Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic dominated diverse music during the 1970s with over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and three [[platinum album]]s.

=== 1980s ===
Clinton\'s efforts as a solo artist began in 1982. He is also a notable [[music producer]] who works on almost all the albums he performs on, and has produced albums for [[Bootsy Collins]] and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], among others. Beginning in the early 1980s, Clinton recorded several nominal solo albums, although all of these records featured contributions from P-Funk\'s core musicians. The primary reason for recording under his own name was legal difficulties, due to the complex copyright and trademark issues surrounding the name "Parliament" (primarily) and [[PolyGram|Polygram]]\'s purchase of that group\'s former label [[Casablanca Records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1982, Clinton signed to [[Capitol Records]] under two names: his own (as a solo artist) and as the P-Funk All-Stars, releasing \'\'[[Computer Games (album)|Computer Games]]\'\' under his own name that same year.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url={{Allmusic|class=artist |id=p65136 |pure_url=yes}} |title=George Clinton - Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1940-07-22 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The single "[[Loopzilla]]" hit the Top 20 on the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] charts, followed by "[[Atomic Dog]]", which reached #1 R&B and #101 on the [[pop music|pop]] chart.<ref name="allmusic.com"/> In the next four years, Clinton released three more studio albums (\'\'[[You Shouldn\'t-Nuf Bit Fish]]\'\', \'\'[[Some of My Best Jokes Are Friends]]\'\', and \'\'[[R&B Skeletons in the Closet]]\'\') as well as a live album, \'\'[[Mothership Connection|Mothership Connection (Live from the Summit, Houston, Texas)]]\'\' and charting three singles in the R&B Top 30, "Nubian Nut", "Last Dance", and "[[Do Fries Go with That Shake?]]". This period of Clinton\'s career was marred by multiple legal problems (resulting in financial difficulties) due to complex royalty and copyright issues, notably with [[Bridgeport Music]], who Clinton claims fraudulently obtained the copyrights to many of his recordings.<ref>Mike Masnick, [https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110614/23544414704/george-clinton-explains-how-bridgeport-allegedly-faked-documents-to-get-his-music-rights.shtml "George Clinton Explains How Bridgeport Allegedly Faked Documents To Get His Music Rights"],Techdirt, June 17, 2011.</ref>

In 1985, he was recruited by the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] to produce their album \'\'[[Freaky Styley]]\'\', because the band members were huge fans of George Clinton\'s and of [[funk]] in general. Clinton, in fact, wrote the vocals and lyrics to the title track which was originally intended by the band to be left as an instrumental piece. The album was not a commercial success at the time, but has since sold 500,000 copies after the Red Hot Chili Peppers became popular years later.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Though Clinton\'s popularity had waned by the mid-1980s, he experienced something of a resurgence in the early 1990s, as many rappers cited him as an influence and began [[sampling (music)|sampling]] his songs. Alongside [[James Brown]], George Clinton is considered to be one of the most sampled musicians ever.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} "Sure, sample my stuff\xe2\x80\xa6" he remarked in 1996. "Ain\'t a better time to get paid than when you\'re my age. You know what to do with money. You don\'t buy as much pussy or drugs with it \xe2\x80\x93 you just buy \'\'some\'\'."<ref>\'\'[[Q (magazine)|Q]]\'\', 1996, precise date unknown</ref>

In 1989, Clinton released \'\'[[The Cinderella Theory]]\'\' on [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince\'s]] record label. This was followed by \'\'[[Hey Man, Smell My Finger]]\'\' in 1993. Clinton then signed with [[550 Music|Sony 550]] and released \'\'[[T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.]]\'\' (The Awesome Power of a Fully Operational Mothership) in 1996, having reunited with several former members of Parliament and Funkadelic.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== 1990s to 2000s ===
1994 saw Clinton contribute to several tracks on [[Primal Scream]]\'s studio album \'\'[[Give Out But Don\'t Give Up]]\'\'. In 1995, Clinton sang "Mind Games" on the John Lennon tribute \'\'Working Class Hero\'\'. In the 1990s, Clinton appeared in films such as \'\'[[Graffiti Bridge (film)|Graffiti Bridge]]\'\' (1990), \'\'[[House Party (film)|House Party]]\'\' (1990), \'\'[[PCU (film)|PCU]]\'\' (1994), \'\'[[Good Burger]]\'\' (1997), and \'\'[[The Breaks]]\'\' (1999). In 1997, he appeared as himself in the [[Cartoon Network]] show \'\'[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]\'\'. Clinton also appeared as the voice of The Funktipus, the DJ of the [[Funk]] radio station Bounce FM in the 2004 [[video game]], \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]\'\', in which his song "Loopzilla" also appeared.

[[Rapping|Rapper]] [[Dr. Dre]] sampled most of Clinton\'s beats to create his [[G-funk|G-Funk]] music era. In 1999, Clinton collaborated with Lil\' Kim, Fred Durst, and Mix Master Mike for Methods of Mayhem\'s single "Get Naked".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Displaying his influence on rap and hip hop, Clinton also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on the song "Can\'t C Me" from the album \'\'[[All Eyez on Me]]\'\';  [[Ice Cube]] on the song and video for "[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]" on the \'\'[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]\'\' album (which sampled Funkadelic\'s earlier hit "[[One Nation Under A Groove]]");  [[Outkast]] on the song "Synthesizer" from the album \'\'[[Aquemini]]\'\'; [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] on the song "J.U.M.P." from the album \'\'[[Malpractice (Redman album)|Malpractice]]\'\'; [[Souls of Mischief]] on "Mama Knows Best" from the album \'\'[[Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution]]\'\'; [[Killah Priest]] on "Come With me" from the album \'\'[[Clergy|Priesthood]]\'\'; the [[Wu-Tang Clan|Wu Tang Clan]] on "Wolves" from the album \'\'[[8 Diagrams]]\'\', and [[Kendrick Lamar]] on the song "Wesley\'s Theory" from the album \'\'[[To Pimp a Butterfly]].\'\'

Clinton founded a record label called The C Kunspyruhzy in 2003. He had a cameo appearance in "[[Where Were We? (How I Met Your Mother)|Where Were We?]]", the season two premiere of the [[CBS]] television [[sitcom]] \'\'[[How I Met Your Mother]]\'\', on September 18, 2006.

Clinton wrote "You\'re Thinking Right", the theme song for \'\'[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]\'\'. He appeared on the intro to [[Snoop Dogg]]\'s \'\'[[Tha Blue Carpet Treatment]]\'\' album, released in 2007. Clinton was also a judge for the 5th annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists\' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>

On September 16, 2008, Clinton released a solo album, \'\'[[George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love]]\'\' on [[Shanachie Records]]. Largely a covers album, \'\'Gangsters\'\' features guest appearances from [[Sly Stone]], [[El DeBarge]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[RZA]], [[Carlos Santana]], gospel singer [[Kim Burrell]] and more.<ref name="gangster">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044956/george-clinton-goes-gangster-on-new-album |title=George Clinton Goes \'Gangster\' On New Album |date=2008-06-27| publisher=Billboard.com| last=Graff| first=Gary}}</ref>

\'\'\'Dennis Coffey\'\'\' (born November 11, 1940, [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[guitarist]]. He was a [[recording studio|studio]] [[musician]] for many [[soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] [[sound recording and reproduction|recordings]].

==Biography==
Coffey learned to play [[guitar]] at the age of thirteen, in the Michigan [[Upper Peninsula]] town of [[Copper City, Michigan|Copper City]]. In 1955, as a fifteen-year-old sophomore at Detroit\'s [[Mackenzie High School (Michigan)|Mackenzie High School]], Dennis played his first [[gramophone record|record]] [[session musician|session]] - backing Vic Gallon in "I\'m Gone", on the Gondola [[record label]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capitolsoulclub.homestead.com/denniscoffey.html |title=capitolsoulclub.homestead.com |publisher=capitolsoulclub.homestead.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> In the early 1960s he joined The Royaltones who had had [[hit record|hits]] with "Poor Boy" in 1958 and "Flamingo Express" in 1961. The Royaltones played sessions with other [[musician|artists]] including [[Del Shannon]].

By the late 1960s as a member of the [[Funk Brothers]] [[studio band]], Coffey played on dozens of recordings for [[Motown Records]], and introduced a hard rock guitar sound to Motown [[record producer]] [[Norman Whitfield]]\'s recordings, including distortion, [[Echoplex]] tape-loop delay, and [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]]; most notably heard on "[[Cloud Nine (The Temptations song)|Cloud Nine]]",  "[[Ball of Confusion (That\'s What the World Is Today)]]" and "[[Psychedelic Shack (song)|Psychedelic Shack]]" by The Temptations. He played on numerous other hit records of the era including #1 singles like  [[Edwin Starr]]\'s "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" and Diana Ross & [[The Supremes]] "[[Someday We\'ll Be Together]]" and [[Freda Payne]]\'s #3 hit "[[Band of Gold (Freda Payne song)|Band of Gold]]". In addition, Coffey [[film score|scored]] the [[blaxploitation]] [[film]], \'\'[[Black Belt Jones]]\'\'.

In 1971, Coffey recorded "Scorpio" which was a million selling [[instrumental]] [[single (music)|single]] that peaked at #9 on the Billboard [[Hot Soul Singles]] chart and at #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard pop chart]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=125}}</ref> The instrumental track featured the former Motown "funk brother", [[Bob Babbitt]] on the bass.  On January 8, 1972 Coffey became the first white artist to perform on the [[television show]] \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\', playing "Scorpio".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845890/ "Soul Train" Dennis Coffey/Detroit Emeralds/Jesse James (TV episode 1972) - IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Scorpio" received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on 9 December 1971.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The follow-up in 1972 was "Taurus", both credited to Coffey and the Detroit Guitar Band. Since then, he has recorded several [[solo (music)|solo]] [[album]]s, most of them for the [[Sussex Records|Sussex]] and [[Westbound Records|Westbound]] labels.  While at Sussex Records Coffey [[arrangement|arranged]] and produced along with Mike Theodore the million selling "Nice To Be With You" by the [[musical ensemble|group]], [[Gallery (band)|Gallery]].

Coffey was interviewed in the 2002 film, \'\'[[Standing in the Shadows of Motown]]\'\', which told the story of [[Funk Brothers]] and explained that he had sold his [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Stratocaster]] to buy a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Gibson Firebird|Firebird]] after he heard [[Eddie Willis]] of [[Funk Brothers]] play it during a Motown session.

In 2004, he published a [[memoir]], \'\'Guitars, Bars and Motown Superstars\'\'.

In 2008, he co-produced the [[Carl Dixon]] sessions at Studio A, [[Dearborn Heights, Michigan|Dearborn Heights]], [[Michigan]]. Four tracks were recorded featuring some of the Funk Brothers including Uriel Jones, [[Bob Babbitt]], Coffey and [[Ray Monette]], plus other distinguished Detroit session musicians. [[Spyder Turner]], Pree and Gayle Butts were vocalists on the session. The session was arranged by David J. Van De Pitte.

On April 26, 2011 (April 25 outside the US) Coffey released the self-titled album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strut-records.com/node/534 |title=Detroit Guitar Legend Dennis Coffey Joins Strut For A New Album &#124; STRUT |publisher=Strut-records.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref> consisting of new songs and new versions of songs which originally featured Coffey\'s distinctive guitar work. Promotion for the album is set to include an international tour, kicking off with several appearances at [[SXSW]]. Singer-songwriter [[Kendra Morris]] accompanied him on tour, performing backing vocals.<ref>[http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/128848-legendary-guitarist-dennis-coffey-announces-tour-dates.html Legendary Guitarist Dennis Coffey Announces New Tour Dates | AltSounds.com News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cantonrep.com/entertainment/x910428250/Dennis-Coffey-You-know-the-music-now-meet-the-man Dennis Coffey: You know the music, now meet the man - Canton, OH - CantonRep.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2012, Coffey was interviewed on the PBS program \'\'[[History Detectives]]\'\', about the authenticity of an old [[Ampeg Portaflex|Ampeg B-15]] amplifier with the stenciled name of fellow Funk Brothers member bassist [[James Jamerson]].<ref>[http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120724/ENT10/207240301/Musical-mystery-Did-old-battered-amplifier-belong-Motown-s-James-Jamerson-PBS-investigates?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Entertainment ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref>

Along with Mike Theodore, Coffey discovered the folk-rock singer-songwriter [[Sixto Rodriguez]] who is the subject of the 2012 Oscar winning film "[[Searching for Sugar Man]]" in which Coffey appears. Coffey played lead guitar on [[Sixto Rodriguez|Rodriguez]]\'s first album [[Cold Fact]].

\'\'\'Gloria Lavern Collins\'\'\', better known as \'\'\'Lyn Collins\'\'\' (12 June 1948 &ndash; 13 March 2005), was an [[African-American]] [[Soul music|soul]] [[singer]] best known for working with [[James Brown]] in the 1970s and for the influential 1972 [[funk]] single "[[Think (About It)]]". Contrary to some reports, she is not related to [[Bootsy Collins|Bootsy]] and [[Catfish Collins]].

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Abilene, Texas]], [[United States of America|U.S.A.]], she began her recording career aged 14. Her biggest solo hit was the James Brown-[[music producer|produced]] [[Gospel music|gospel]]-style song "[[Think (About It)]]", from her 1972 [[album]] of the same name on [[People Records]]. The song contains five [[break (music)|breaks]] which have been widely sampled in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[drum and bass]], most famously, the "[[Yeah! Woo!]]" and "It takes two to make a thing go right" loops in [[Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock]]\'s "[[It Takes Two (Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock song)|It Takes Two]]" which is composed almost completely from samples of \'\'Think\'\' including a few lines of Collins\' vocals. Furthermore, it was used in the early sociocritical eurodance classic \'\'I Can\'t Stand It\'\' by [[Twenty 4 Seven]], and in the 2013 EDM/House song "[[Everything You Never Had (We Had It All)]]" by [[Ben Westbeech|Breach]]. Another album followed in 1975 \'\'Check Me Out If You Don\'t Know Me by Now\'\'. After the release of this album, she returned to performing mainly as a back-up vocalist.

In the late 1980s and early \'90s, Collins attempted a comeback as a [[dance music|dance/club]] diva, recording the [[house music|house]] single "Shout" for Belgium\'s [[ARS Records|ARS]] label. In 1993, Collins\' profile was given a boost by female [[dancehall]] singer [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], who invited Collins to perform on her hit remake of "[[Think (About It)]]"; partly due to the resulting interest, her two official albums were [[reissue]]d in [[England]] and [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. Collins continued to tour and perform, most notably at the European Jazz/Funk Festival (in both 1998 and 1999) and the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

In February 2005, Collins embarked on her first ever solo tour. For three weeks, she performed in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The tour was produced by the Soulpower organization. Shortly after returning from her European tour, Collins died aged 56 in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], of [[cardiac arrhythmia]].

In 2006, Paris-based Hi&Fly Records released a live album entitled \'\'Mama Feelgood\'\', which included recordings from her European tour and some interview clips. This release was produced by German-born [[DJ Pari]], who has also produced for [[Marva Whitney]] and who has managed Collins\' last tour. An official anthology CD, also called \'\'Mama Feelgood\'\', was released on Universal Music that same year.

==Legacy==
*In October 2004, "Rock Me Again And Again" and "Think (About It)" featured on the \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]\'\' [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|soundtrack]], playing on fictional radio station [[Master Sounds 98.3]].
*"Rock Me Again And Again" was [[Cover version|covered]] by synth band [[The Human League]] on their 1984 album \'\'[[Hysteria (Human League album)|Hysteria]].\'\'
* [[Bruce Springsteen]]\'s song "Shackled and Drawn", from his 2012 album \'\'[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]\'\', and Ludacris\' song "Southern Fried Intro", from his 2003 album \'\'[[Chicken-n-Beer]]\'\', both feature an excerpt from Collins\' song "Me And My Baby Got Our Own Thing Going."

The \'\'\'Commodores\'\'\' are an American [[funk]]/[[Soul music|soul]] band, which was at its peak in the late 1970s through the mid 1980s. The members of the group met as mostly [[freshmen]] at Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]) in 1968, and signed with [[Motown]] in November 1972, having first caught the public eye opening for [[The Jackson 5]] while on [[concert tour|tour]].

The group\'s most successful period was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when [[Lionel Richie]] was co-lead singer. The band\'s biggest [[hit record|hit singles]] are [[ballad]]s such as "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", "[[Three Times a Lady]]", and "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]"; and [[funk]]y dance hits which include "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]", "Fancy Dancer", "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]", and "[[Too Hot ta Trot]]". However it was in 1986 that the Commodores won their first Grammy for the song "Nightshift".

==Band history==
The Commodores originally came together from two former groups, the Mystics and the Jays, but wanted to change the name. Together, a six-man band was created from which the notable individuals were Lionel Richie, [[Thomas McClary (musician)|Thomas McClary]], and William King from the Mystics; Andre Callahan, Michael Gilbert, and Milan Williams were from the Jays. To choose a new name, William "WAK" King opened a dictionary and randomly picked a word. "We lucked out", he remarked with a laugh when telling this story to \'\'[[People (American magazine)|People]]\'\' magazine. "We almost became \'The Commodes!\'"{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

"[[Machine Gun (Commodores album)|Machine Gun]]", the instrumental title track from the band\'s debut album, became a staple at American sporting events,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and is similarly featured in many films, including \'\'[[Boogie Nights]]\'\' and \'\'[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]\'\'. It reached No. 22 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 in 1975. Another instrumental, "[[Cebu]]" (named after an [[Cebu Province|island]] in the [[Philippines]]), later became a staple{{by whom|date=November 2012}} in the [[Quiet storm]] format. Three albums released in 1975 and 1976 (\'\'[[Caught in the Act (Commodores album)|Caught in the Act]]\'\', \'\'[[Movin\' On (Commodores album)|Movin\' On]]\'\', and \'\'[[Hot On The Tracks]]\'\') are considered{{By whom|date=October 2014}} the peak of their harder funk period. After those recordings the group started to move towards a softer sound. That move was hinted at in their 1976 Top Ten hits "Sweet Love" and "[[Just to Be Close to You]]". In 1977 the Commodores released "[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]", which became the group\'s biggest hit yet, reaching No. 4 in the U.S., followed by "Brick House", also top 5, both from their album \'\'The Commodores\'\', as was "Zoom". The group reached No. 1 in 1978 with "[[Three Times a Lady]]". In 1979 the Commodores scored another top-five ballad, "Sail On", before reaching the top of the charts once again with another ballad, "[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]". In 1981 they released two top-ten hits with "Oh No" (No. 4) and their first upbeat single in almost five years, "[[Lady (You Bring Me Up)]]" (No. 8).

The band originated while its members attended [[Tuskegee University]] in Alabama. After winning the university\'s annual freshman talent contest, they played at fraternity parties as well as a weekend gig at the Black Forest Inn, one of a few clubs in Tuskegee that catered to college students. They performed mostly cover tunes and some original songs with their first singer, James Ingram (not the [[James Ingram|famous solo artist]]). Ingram, older than the rest of the band, left to serve active duty in [[Vietnam]], and was later replaced by Walter "Clyde" Orange, who would write or co-write many of their hit tunes. [[Lionel Richie]] and Orange alternated as lead singers. (Orange was the lead singer on the Top 10 hits "Brick House" and "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]".)

The Commodores made a brief appearance in the 1978 film \'\'[[Thank God It\'s Friday]]\'\'. They performed the song "Too Hot ta Trot" during the dance contest; the songs "Brick House" and "Easy" were also played during the movie.

In 1982, Lionel Richie left to pursue a solo career. A transition that was smooth but slow, Richie\'s departure was evident after it was mentioned to the band why his distinct sound would ever be a part of The Commodores; Skyler Jett replaced Richie as co-lead singer.

Over time, several founding members left. McClary left in 1983 (shortly after Richie) to pursue a solo career and to develop a [[gospel music]] company. McClary was replaced by guitarist-vocalist [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]]. LaPread left in 1986 and moved to Auckland, New Zealand, and Reynolds departed for [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] in 1987, which prompted trumpeter William "WAK" King to take over primary guitar duties for live performances. Keyboardist Milan Williams exited the band in 1989. The group also gradually abandoned its funk roots and moved into the more commercial pop arena. In 1984 former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] singer James Dean "J.D." Nicholas assumed co-lead vocal duties with drummer Walter Orange. The band remained hitless until 1985 when their final [[Motown]] album, \'\'Nightshift\'\', produced by Dennis Lambert\xe2\x80\x94all prior albums were produced by [[James Anthony Carmichael]])\xe2\x80\x94delivered the Grammy Award-winning title track "[[Nightshift (song)|Nightshift]]" (No. 3 in the U.S.). It was a tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Jackie Wilson]]. In 2010 a new version was recorded, dedicated to [[Michael Jackson]].<ref>[http://mjfanclub.net/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3859:commodores-re-record-qnightshiftq-as-mj-tribute&catid=85:latest-news&Itemid=82 Commodores Re-record "Nightshift" As MJ Tribute]</ref> The Commodores were on a European tour performing at Wembley Arena, London, on June 25, 2009, when they walked off the stage after they were told that Michael Jackson had died. Initially the band thought it was a hoax. However, back in their dressing rooms they received confirmation and broke down in tears. The next night in Birmingham\'s NIA Arena, J.D. Nicholas added Jackson\'s name into the lyrics of the song, and thenceforth the Commodores have mentioned Jackson and other deceased R&B singers. Thus came the inspiration upon the one-year anniversary of Jackson\'s death, to re-record, with new lyrics, the hit song "Nightshift" as a tribute. "Nightshift" won The Commodores their first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals]] in 1985.

In 1990 the Commodores formed Commodores Records and re-recorded their 20 greatest hits as \'\'Commodores Hits Vol. I & II\'\'. They have [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] a live album \'\'Commodores Live\'\' along with a DVD of the same name, and a Christmas album titled \'\'Commodores Christmas\'\'. In 2012, the band was working on new material, some contributions written by current and former members.

The Commodores now consist of Walter "Clyde" Orange, James Dean "J.D." Nicholas, and William "WAK" King, along with their five-piece band, known as the "Mean Machine". The group continues to perform, playing at arenas, theaters, and festivals around the world.

\'\'\'Con Funk Shun\'\'\' (also known as Project Soul) was an [[United States|American]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[funk]] [[band (music)|band]] popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Influences include James Brown and [[Sly & the Family Stone]].

==History==
The band began in 1969 as Project Soul, formed by [[Vallejo, California]] [[high school]] students, [[Louis A. McCall Sr.]] (drums/percussion/vocals) and Michael Cooper (rhythm guitar/lead vocals). By 1971, the group which included bassist Cedric Martin, keyboardist Danny "Sweet Man" Thomas, trumpeter Karl Fuller, and [[woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] player Paul "Maceo" Harrell.  Soon thereafter, this fledgling group\'s classic lineup became complete when singer/multi-instrumentalist [[Felton Pilate]] came on board.  In 1971, those seven musicians founded a new band, calling themselves "Con-Funk-Shun", after a song by the instrumental ensemble [[The Nite-Liters]].  They relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 1973 when they were hired to back up Stax Records artists [[The Soul Children]]. There, they came to the attention of Estelle Axton who signed them to her Fretone Records label.  Their first album, "Organized Con Funk Shun" was released in 1973.  In 1974, their name was officially changed to Con Funk Shun by McCall\'s future wife, Linda Lou McCall (n\xc3\xa9e Bolden), when she became the group\'s publicist and created their logos.

In 1976, Con Funk Shun signed to [[Mercury Records]], releasing 11 albums over a span of 10 years. The group\'s 1977 LP, \'\'Secrets,\'\' was certified [[gold album|gold]] in the US, as were 1978\'s \'\'Loveshine,\'\' 1979\'s \'\'Candy,\'\' and 1980\'s \'\'Spirit of Love.\'\'<ref>Search for "Con Funk Shun" performed at [[RIAA|RIAA.com]] on Dec. 10, 2007.</ref> They scored a string of [[Top 40|top ten]] [[hit single|hits]] on the [[United States|US]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|black singles]] [[record chart|chart]], including 1977\'s "[[Ffun]]" (#1), 1978\'s "Shake and Dance with Me" (#5), 1979\'s "Chase Me" (#4), 1980s "Got to Be Enough" (#8), and "Too Tight" (#8). Tensions from within the group built over the 1980s, and the group\'s last album, \'\'Burning Love,\'\' was recorded without songwriter and vocalist [[Felton Pilate]]. After leaving Mercury, the original band members ceased performing and recording as Con Funk Shun in 1987.  As recently as 2013, their 11 Mercury Records albums, along with "Greatest Hits", and "Best Of Con Funk Shun" albums continue to be remastered and released digitally.

==Legacy==
Con Funk Shun continues to receive airplay on US [[soul music|soul]] radio stations that play music of the 1970s and 1980s. Additionally, their back-beats have been repeatedly [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by later artists in [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[Rap music|rap]].  Most recently, "Honey Wild", (written by Louis McCall; his wife, Linda Lou McCall; and Danny Thomas), from their 1980 \'\'Spirit of Love\'\' album was sampled by [[Lil Wayne]] for his CD \'\'[[Tha Carter III]] - Deluxe Edition\'\'. In 1996, [[Dru Hill]] covered the song "Love\'s Train" on their [[Dru Hill (album)|self-titled d\xc3\xa9but album]] which was produced by [[Keith Sweat]].  Jason Mraz has performed "Ffun" on numerous occasions during his live performances as well. The song "That\'s What Love Can Do" by Boykrazy, heavily samples "Too Tight".

Born in Alameda, CA, the name of the late [[Louis A. McCall Sr.]] was chosen by the City Planning Board in April 2014 to be used to name one of the streets in the proposed residential community, Alameda Landing.  On September 21, 2014, the seven band members were honored by the National R&B Music Society with a Lifetime Achievement Award.  Louis\' wife, Linda Lou McCall, was also given an "Unsung Heroine" award for her continued work on behalf of her husband\'s band, in addition to her 45 year contribution to R&B music.

\'\'\'Domenica "Nikka" Costa\'\'\' (born June 4, 1972) is an American singer whose music combines elements of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[blues]]. She also had a career as a child singer starting in the early 1980s. She is the daughter of notable music producer [[Don Costa]] and is married to Australian producer/songwriter [[Justin Stanley]].

==Early life==
Nikka Costa was born in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].<ref name="mguide">[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004710/Nikka-Costa.html Nikka Costa Biography]</ref> Her father [[Don Costa]] was a notable producer and a musician with many connections in the music business. During her childhood Costa was surrounded by famous musicians and traveled around the world with her father.<ref name="mguide"/>

At age 5 Costa recorded a single with Hawaiian singer [[Don Ho]]. Italian producers Danny B. Besquet and Tony Renis were working with her father on the album \'\'Don Costa Plays [[The Beatles]]\'\' when they had a brainstorm to produce an album with Nikka singing while her father played acoustic guitar. The album was well received in Europe and Costa became known as a child star. At age 9 Costa sang with [[Frank Sinatra]] in an appearance on the lawn of the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1502554/20050518/costa_nikka.jhtml |title=Nikka Costa : Nikka Costa: Tour Talk - Rhapsody Music Downloads |publisher=VH1.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-08}}</ref>

Costa\'s career as a recording artist under her own name started in 1981, when she recorded the song "(Out Here) On My Own" (from the musical \'\'[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]\'\'). The single, recorded in [[Milan]] with the conductor Victor Bach and produced by Besquet and [[Tony Renis|Renis]], spent fourteen weeks at number 1 in [[Italy]], nine weeks at number 1 in Spain, and five weeks at number 1 in [[France]]. The song also reached number 7 in [[Switzerland]] and number 32 in the Netherlands. The album \'\'Nikka Costa\'\', produced by Besquet and Remis, was released outside the U.S. in 1981. The album reached #1 in Europe and South America{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and Costa toured around the world.<ref name="mguide"/> Her second album \'\'Fairy Tales (cuentos de hadas)\'\' was released in 1983. Don Costa died of a heart attack shortly after the album was recorded. The pop album \'\'Here I Am... Yes, It\'s Me\'\' was released to fulfill a contractual obligation in 1989, though it still topped some charts in Europe.<ref name="mguide"/> In 1990 she performed at the [[San Remo Music Festival]] with a rendition of \'\'All for the Love\'\', an English version of \'\'Vattene amore\'\' by [[Mietta]] and [[Amedeo Minghi]].

After graduating from high school, Costa decided to move away from pop and moved toward funk and soul, becoming influenced by [[Motown]] artists.<ref name="mguide"/>

==Adult career==
While already a music business veteran, in the early 1990s Costa transitioned away from childhood pop to mature soul. She married Australian producer/songwriter Justin Stanley and moved to his country. (Costa and Stanley now have a daughter named Sugar McQueen.) While in Australia, Costa began writing her own songs and formed a "happy funk" band called Little Mona & The Shag Daddies, which broke up after four gigs in Sydney. Costa\'s next venture was a band called Sugarbone, which toured Australia in 1994. Costa describes the experience as "It was really scary to unveil it but the reaction was good. It helped my confidence." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2001/08/20/hotstar29849.aspx |title=Nikka.Costa |publisher=Pollstar |date= |accessdate=2012-05-08}}</ref> After Sugarbone, she signed to the Mushroom label in Australia. In 1996 Costa released the album \'\'[[Butterfly Rocket]]\'\' in Australia, which reached the Top 20. The record led to a nomination for [[ARIA Music Awards]] Breakthrough Artist in 1996 and Best Female Artist in 1997.<ref>[http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=1997 ARIA Awards History: Winners by Year - 1997]</ref>

In 2000, Costa\'s song "Like A Feather" was featured in a [[Tommy Hilfiger]] television [[advertising campaign]]. That exposure coupled with the track\'s music video helped launch her U.S. music career. The album \'\'[[Everybody Got Their Something]]\'\' was released in 2001 and reached #120 on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]]. The title track and "Like a Feather" were radio hits, although the latter did peak at #53 in the United Kingdom.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In 2006 she and her husband Justin recorded and performed the theme to the short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom  "[[Courting Alex]]", which starred [[Jenna Elfman]].

Costa was a guest singer on [[Mark Ronson]]\'s album \'\'Here Comes the Fuzz\'\'. Ronson has produced some of Costa\'s songs.<ref>[[Mark Ronson]]</ref> Her song "Push & Pull" from the album \'\'Everybody Got Their Something\'\' is included in the soundtrack of the 2001 movie \'\'[[Blow (film)|Blow]]\'\' starring [[Johnny Depp]]. Her song "Everybody Got Their Something", was used in the soundtrack of the 2009 movie \'\'[[All About Steve]]\'\' starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[Bradley Cooper]]. Her song "Stuck To You" from the album \'\'[[Pebble to a Pearl]]\'\' was used in an episode of \'\'[[Grey\'s Anatomy]]\'\' in season five.

Costa is currently signed with Stax Records.<ref>[http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/news/nikka-costa-signs-with-stax-records/ Concord Music Group - Nikka Costa Signs With Stax Records!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her latest studio album \'\'[[Pebble to a Pearl]]\'\' was released on October 14, 2008. In 2010 she released the single "Ching Ching Ching" in Europe. The song is notable from a genre change from soul/funk to electro-pop. The single reached #77 in Germany, making it Costa\'s first single to chart in Germany since "On My Own" in 1981. A new album titled \'\'[[PROWHOA|PRO\xe2\x98\x85WHOA!]]\'\' was set for release in late 2010 but has been delayed until early 2011. Costa co-wrote the song "Diamonds Made from Rain" on [[Eric Clapton]]\'s 2010 album \'\'[[Clapton (2010 album)|Clapton]]\'\'.

Costa sings a reinterpreted version of the [[INXS]] hit "Kick", on the INXS album \'\'[[Original Sin (INXS album)|Original Sin]]\'\', digitally released in Australia in October 2010, and in the United States in April 2011.

\'\'\'Cymande\'\'\' (See-mandy) are a [[United Kingdom|British]] funk group that released several albums throughout the early 1970s and have recently reunited in 2014 with a European tour and a new album planned for release in 2015. The group was formed by Steve Scipio and Patrick Patterson in 1971 in [[London]], [[England]], along with musicians from [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]]. The name Cymande is derived from a [[Calypso music|Calypso]] word for Dove, symbolizing peace and love.

==Career==
The group developed a subtle and complex, deep [[funk]] style  influenced by calypso rhythms, [[jazz]], [[African]] music, American [[soul music|soul]] and  UK [[Rock music|rock]] of the time. By the mid-1970s the band members were going their separate ways, and the group disbanded in 1974. It was not until 20 years later that they reaped any financial rewards, as their music became a popular source for samplers. Cymande\'s original albums are still widely sought-after by [[DJ]]s and funk aficionados.  Perhaps the band\'s best known recording is the soulful dancefloor filler called "Bra", which was later sampled by the American hip-hop group [[De La Soul]] and used as a breakbeat record by [[Kool Herc]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]].

Cymande was accidentally discovered by English producer [[John Schroeder (musician)|John Schroeder]] in a Soho, London club where they were rehearsing. He was there to see a rock band but the gig had been cancelled, and he stumbled upon these West Indian musicians. He soon signed the band and recorded their initial single "The Message."  The single was released by [[Janus Records]], a division of [[Chess Records]]. The track reached #20 on the [[United States|US]] \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]]. This set the stage for Cymande\'s self-titled release in 1972.

Cymande traveled to [[New York City|New York]] after the success of the first album, and began a tour of the US with [[Al Green]]. They also shared a few bills with the Latin funk ensemble [[Mandrill (band)|Mandrill]]. They played a few important venues, including [[The Apollo]], and played a gig on \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\'.

The band released three LPs for Janus. However, their final album, \'\'Promised Heights\'\', was not released in the US, where Cymande had achieved their initial success. \'\'Promised Heights\'\' included "Brothers on the Slide", "The Recluse" and "Promised Heights". The tracks "Brothers on the Slide" and "Bra" also were staples of the [[rare groove]] scene that developed in London and New York [[nightclub]]s during the 1980s.  

Members of the band reunited for a performance in [[Brighton]] on 19 May 2006, during the UK Funk All-Stars night, as part of the [[Brighton Festival]] 2006.

==2012 reunion==

Sometime in mid-2012, it was announced that the band were to release a new album sometime before the end of the year. The reunion included the original core band members, producer John Schroeder and engineer Alan Florence, with initial rehearsals at Panic rehearsal rooms, recording at Grange Farm Studios, Cambs, in 2012, and a scheduled tour to accompany the album in 2012 - including a date at the [[London Jazz Festival]] in November.<ref>[http://cymande-online.com/2011/11/cymande-reunites-to-release-album-in-2012/ "Cymande Reunites".]</ref>

However, in October 2012, a message was posted on the Cymande website stating: "Due to circumstances beyond their control, Cymande has had to postpone plans for live shows, including the show scheduled for Fairfield Halls on 18th November, until the New Year. We were looking forward to reuniting with our fans after so many years and are greatly disappointed. However, we look forward to live performances in the New Year. We also hope to have further news regarding the release of our anticipated new album. The recording of that album is now complete and will shortly be mixed in readiness for release. We will continue to post updates on this website.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>[http://cymande-online.com/2012/10/our-reunion-concert/ "Cancellation Notice".]</ref>

==2014 reunion==
Some core members of the band have recently reunited to release a new album and begin a European tour, with the first announced date on Thursday, 25 September 2014, at London\'s Koko.<ref>[http://agmp.ticketabc.com/events/cymande/ "CYMANDE + Push + DJ Perry Louis"], Adrian Gibson Music Productions.</ref>

\'\'\'DAG\'\'\' was a [[funk]] alternative band from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] which formed in 1989 and disbanded in 1999. 

The band of singer and bassist Bobby Patterson, guitarist Brian Dennis, drummer Kenny Soule (from rock bands [[Nantucket (band)|Nantucket]] and [[PKM (band)|PKM]]) and keyboardist Doug Jervey had already earned many loyal listeners around their hometown over the next few years with their uncommonly 1970s wild funk persona; and with the help of [[Grammy award|Grammy]] nominee and local record producer [[John Custer]] (who also developed [[Cry of Love (band)|Cry Of Love]] and produced several [[Corrosion of Conformity]] albums), DAG gained the attention of some major record labels. 

DAG signed with [[Columbia Records]], and released their debut album \'\'[[Righteous (album)|Righteous]]\'\' in 1994. Their recordings even attracted special guest performances from [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] drummer [[Roger Hawkins]], also known for drum work with [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Steve Winwood]] and others. The album was well praised nationally with high reviews.  

Their 1998 follow-up, \'\'[[Apartment 635|Apartment #635]]\'\' received some critical acclaim. A six-song [[compilation album]], called \'\'[[A Guide to Groovy Lovin\']]\'\', was also released that year. The band split soon after due to changes in musical preferences. 

DAG songs were featured in two motion pictures, \'\'[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]\'\' and \'\'[[Pr\xc3\xaat-\xc3\xa0-Porter (film)|Ready To Wear (Pr\xc3\xaat-\xc3\xa0-Porter)]]\'\'. Additionally, a live in-studio version of \'Lovely Jane\' was included on the CD "The Best Of The Columbia Records Radio Hour, Vol. 2" along with tracks by such artists as The Dave Matthews Band and James Taylor.

\'\'\'Betty Davis\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Betty Mabry\'\'\', July 26, 1945)<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p16873}}</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] singer.
== Background ==

Born in 1945, Betty Mabry grew up in [[Durham, North Carolina]], and just outside of [[Pittsburgh]]. On her grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s farm in [[Reidsville, North Carolina]], she listened to [[B.B. King]], [[Jimmy Reed]], and [[Elmore James]] and other blues musicians. One of the first songs she wrote, at the age of twelve, was called "I\xe2\x80\x99m Going to Bake That Cake of Love."{{cn|date=December 2012}}

Aged 16, she left Pittsburgh for [[New York City]], enrolling at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] while living with her aunt. She soaked up the [[Greenwich Village]] culture and [[folk music]] of the early 1960s.  She associated herself with frequenters of the Cellar, a hip uptown club where young and stylish people congregated. It was a multiracial, artsy crowd of models, design students, actors, and singers. At the Cellar she played records and chatted people up. She also worked as a model, appearing in photo spreads in \'\'[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]\'\', \'\'[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]\'\' and \'\'[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Betty%20Davis.html |title=Betty Davis|publisher=Soulwalking.co.uk|accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref>

In her time in New York, she met several musicians including [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Sly Stone]]. The seeds of her musical career were planted through her friendship with soul singer [[Lou Courtney]], who produced her first single, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cellar\xe2\x80\x9d with simple, catchy lyrics like, \'\'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you going fellas, so fly? / I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Cellar, my oh my / What you going to do there / We\xe2\x80\x99re going to boogaloo there.\xe2\x80\x9d\'\'

The single was a local jam for the Cellar. Yet her first professional gig was not until she wrote "Uptown (to Harlem)" for the [[Chambers Brothers]]. Their 1967 album was a major success, but Betty Mabry was focusing on her modeling career. She was successful as a model but felt bored by the work. According to Oliver Wang\xe2\x80\x99s \'\'They Say I\xe2\x80\x99m Different\'\' liner notes, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like modeling because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t need brains to do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s only going to last as long as you look good.\xe2\x80\x9d{{cn|date=December 2012}}

== Marriage to Miles Davis ==

She met [[Miles Davis]] in 1967 and married him in September 1968. In just one year of marriage she influenced him greatly by introducing him to the fashions and the new popular music trends of the era. In his autobiography, Miles credited Betty with helping to plant the seeds of his future musical explorations by introducing the trumpeter to [[psychedelic rock]] guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] and funk innovator [[Sly Stone]]. The Miles Davis album \'\'[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]\'\' includes a song named after her and her photo on the front cover. 

Miles believed that Hendrix and Betty had an affair which supposedly hastened the end of their marriage, but Betty denies this. Hendrix and Miles stayed close after the divorce, planning to record until Hendrix\'s death. The influence of Hendrix and especially Sly Stone on Miles Davis was obvious on the album \'\'[[Bitches Brew]]\'\', which ushered in the era of [[jazz fusion]]. The origin of the album\'s title is unknown, but some believe Miles was subtly paying tribute to Betty and her girlfriends. In fact, it is said that he originally wanted to call the album \'\'Witches Brew\'\'\xe2\x80\x94it was Betty who convinced him to change it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2010-09-07-madonna-before-madonna-the-woman-who-introduced-miles-to-hendrix-finally-speaks|title=Madonna before Madonna: The woman who introduced Miles to Hendrix finally speaks|publisher=Thedailymaverick.co.za|accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref>

== Music career ==

Betty\'s first major credit was writing Uptown for the Chambers Brothers, 1967.

After the end of her marriage with Davis, Betty moved to [[London]], probably around 1971, to pursue her modeling career. She wrote music while in the UK and returned to the US around 1972 with the intention of recording songs with Santana. Instead, she recorded her own songs with a group of West Coast funk musicians.  Her first record, \'\'[[Betty Davis (album)|Betty Davis]]\'\', was released in 1973. She had two minor hits on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]] - "If I\'m In Luck I Might Get Picked Up", which reached no. 66 in 1973, and "Shut Off The Lights", which reached no. 97 in 1975.<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=104}}</ref>  Davis released two more studio albums, \'\'They Say I\'m Different\'\' (1974) and her major label debut on Island Records \'\'Nasty Gal\'\' (1975). None of the three albums was a commercial success. 

Davis remained a cult figure as a singer, due in part to her open sexual attitude, which was controversial for the time. Some of her shows were boycotted and her songs were not played on the radio due to pressure by religious groups and the NAACP.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mahon|first=Maureen|title=They Say She\xe2\x80\x99s Different: Race, Gender, Genre, and the Liberated Black Femininity of Betty Davis|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=146\xe2\x80\x93165|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|date=15 June 2011|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-1598.2011.01277.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2011.01277.x}}</ref>

Both \'\'Betty Davis\'\' and \'\'They Say I\'m Different\'\' were re-released by Seattle\'s [[Light in the Attic Records]] on May 1, 2007. In September 2009, Light in the Attic Records reissued \'\'Nasty Gal\'\' and her unreleased fourth studio album recorded in 1976, re-titled as \'\'Is It Love or Desire?\'\' (the original title was \'\'Crashin\' From Passion\'\'). Both reissues contained extensive liner notes and shed some light on the mystery of why her fourth album, considered possibly to be her best work by many members of her band ([[Herbie Hancock]], [[Chuck Rainey]], [[Alphonse Mouzon]]), {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} was shelved by the record label and remained unreleased for 33 years. After a final recording session in 1979, Davis eventually stopped making music and returned to Pennsylvania.

Material from the 1979 recording session was eventually used for two bootleg albums, \'\'Hangin\' Out In Hollywood\'\' (1995) and \'\'Crashin\' From Passion\'\' (1996). A [[greatest hits]] album, \'\'Anti Love: The Best of Betty Davis,\'\' was released in 2000.

\'\'\'Morris E. Day\'\'\' (born December 13, 1957) is an American musician, composer and actor. He is best known as the lead singer of [[The Time (band)|The Time]].

==Musical career==

===1970s and 1980s===
In high school, Day was in a band with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Andr\xc3\xa9 Cymone]] and the trio formed an early band managed by Day\'s mother called "Grand Central," later renamed "Champagne."  Later, Prince embarked on a solo career but retained Cymone for his backing band. The two began to plan a side group that would focus more on R&B, while Prince would continue to explore various musical styles. The Time was composed of 4 members from an earlier funk group called "[[Flyte Tyme (band)|Flyte Tyme]]," but the lead singer had not been chosen. Charles Alexander Cobb, of Saint Paul, was considered but he turned it down. Sue Ann Carwell was auditioned; and [[Alexander O\'Neal]] nearly became The Time\'s lead singer, but dropped out due to payment negotiations. Day, who was now in a band called "Enterprise", allowed Prince to have a song called "Partyup" for his \'\'[[Dirty Mind]]\'\' album, and Prince would soon return the favor by giving Day the job of lead singer. Day would suggest guitarist [[Jesse Johnson (musician)|Jesse Johnson]], who completed the band\'s ensemble.

The Time\'s most prolific and visible period came in 1984, when Day played the antagonist to Prince in his feature films \'\'[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]\'\' and \'\'[[Graffiti Bridge (film)|Graffiti Bridge]]\'\', which helped establish Day\'s playboy stage presence. Typically escorted by his valet, "Jerome" ([[Jerome Benton]]), Day won fans with his exaggerated vanity ("Jerome bring me my mirror!") and strutting bravado ("Ain\'t nobody bad like me!"), acting as a comic foil to Prince\'s romantic, sensitive lead. This persona was further exploited for comic effect on The Time\'s records, on songs such as "Chili Sauce" and "If the Kid Can\'t Make You Come" from the album \'\'[[Ice Cream Castle]]\'\'.

That album, the group\'s most popular, is best remembered for the infectious singles "[[Jungle Love (The Time song)|Jungle Love]]" and the [[Rufus Thomas]] influenced, "[[The Bird (The Time song)|The Bird]]." With their palpable pop energy and catchy choruses, both songs were hits on both urban and pop radio.

With the breakup of The Time in 1984, Day began his solo career. In 1985, Day released his solo debut \'\'[[Color of Success]]\'\'. The album featured the singles "The Oak Tree" as well as the title track and the [[Quiet Storm]] ballad "Don\'t Wait For Me".

The low sales of his follow-up albums- 1987\'s \'\'[[Daydreaming (Morris Day album)|Daydreaming]]\'\' (which spawned the single "Fishnet") and his most commercially viable solo album, \'\'[[Guaranteed (Morris Day album)|Guaranteed]]\'\'- were a blow to his career.

In 1986 Morris Day married Judith Day.  They were married for 22 years, until 2008.  They had three children together.

In 1988 he starred as Curtis on the short-lived and poorly received series, \'\'Heart & Soul\'\', along with [[Tisha Campbell]].<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7C365943EB2C6&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Morris Day Stars in \'Heart and Soul\'] Atlanta Constitution Journal</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LH&s_site=kentucky&p_multi=LH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB73AD3419FA0A7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM HEART AND SOUL\' PILOT HEAVY ON MELODRAMA] Lexington Herald Leader</ref><ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/467514/Heart-and-Soul/ Turner Classic Movies Entry]</ref>

===1990s===
It wasn\'t until 1990 that The Time scored a #1 R&B hit with "[[Jerk Out]]," a [[Dance-funk]] cut from their reunited fourth album, \'\'[[Pandemonium (The Time album)|Pandemonium]]\'\'. This album also featured the original members of the band.  The same year, Day formed his own girl band (not unlike Prince\'s [[Vanity 6]]/[[Apollonia 6]]) called The Day Zs.  The group\'s first and only album release was produced by Day and he sang on one of the tracks called "Green Acres."

From that high point, Day\'s success began to wane. The general decline of Prince\'s popularity soon after did not help, and Day\'s public visibility and creative output waned considerably.

===2000 to present===
Day came out of his self-imposed retirement because of his fans\' support. Day has remained a popular concert draw since the late 1990s, fronting a revamped lineup of The Time, including originals [[Jellybean Johnson]] on drums and [[Monte Moir]] on keyboards. The band was invited to perform on Prince\'s direct to video concert film, "Rave Un2 The Year 2000", in December 1999.

Day has also appeared regularly in local television commercials for a [[Toyota]] dealership in the [[Atlanta]] area.

As of 2007, Day is band leader on the [[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] program \'\'[[Baisden After Dark]]\'\'.

He reunited with the original members of The Time after 18 years for a performance with [[Rihanna]] at the 50th Grammy Awards show.

Morris Day and The Time performed at the 2008 HR Florida State Conference.

Morris Day is now performing with his new band called The Original 7ven the band includes most of the members of the original band The Time hence the name.

The new album was released in 2011 and is called \'\'Condensate\'\'.

==Acting career==
Day continued to act in films from time to time in small parts (including a brief but memorable turn in [[Richard Pryor]]\'s \'\'[[Moving (1988 film)|Moving]]\'\', and the [[Andrew Dice Clay]] (1990 film) [[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]). Day\'s presence on the screen decreased until, in 2001, he returned to film in [[Kevin Smith]]\'s \'\'[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]\'\', performing "Jungle Love" with The Time and dancing with the movie\'s stars in the film\'s coda, and being introduced emphatically by [[Jason Mewes]]\' character as "Morris Day and The motherfuckin\' Time!".

Day also appeared on the small screen in 1990 when he portrayed the character Lamarr on ABC\'s short-lived sitcom \'\'[[New Attitude (TV series)|New Attitude]]\'\'.  He guest-starred on the sitcom \'\'[[Eve (TV series)|Eve]]\'\' as a [[pimp]] who wanted Eve\'s fashion boutique to design a flamboyant suit to match his witty personality, and appeared as himself in an episode on the series [[Moesha]], attempting to file a lawsuit against Moesha\'s ex-boyfriend Q, who used a sample from "The Oak Tree" without permission. He also appeared on [[227 (TV series)|227]] in the 80\'s.

He appeared opposite James Avery and Matthew Stewart in a pilot called Heart & Soul.

==Appearances in popular culture==
From 1986 to 1987, [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] wrestler "Birdman" [[Koko B. Ware]] first used "The Bird" as his entrance theme. 

He appeared with The Time at the end of the movie \'\'[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]\'\' and was referred to as the main characters\' favorite band.

In 1994, Day was featured on and provided the chorus and accompanying vocals for rapper [[K-Dee]]\'s song "Gigolos Get Lonely Too" from the \'\'[[Ass, Gas, or Cash (No One Rides for Free)|Ass, Gas, or Cash]]\'\' album.  This song was essentially a direct sampling of a similarly named "Gigolos Get Lonely Too", recorded by The Time in the 80\'s.

A song called "Morris Day" appears on the album \'\'[[Felt, Vol. 2: A Tribute to Lisa Bonet]]\'\' by the hip-hop group [[Felt (hip hop)|Felt]].

Mentioned in Dirt Nasty\'s song \'\'1980\'\'.

 ****** Dazz Band

b'{{Refimprove|date=March 2015}}
The \'\'\'Dazz Band\'\'\' is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] music band whose popularity exploded in the early 1980s. Emerging from [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], the group\'s biggest hit songs include the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Grammy Award]]-winning "[[Let It Whip]]" (1982), "[[Joystick (song)|Joystick]]" (1983), and "Let It All Blow" (1984). The name of the band is a [[portmanteau]] of the description "danceable jazz".

The group was originally named \'\'Kinsman Dazz\'\' at the suggestion of Ray Calabrese, who would later become the band\'s manager along with Sonny Jones, owner of The Kinsman Grill, located near the street Bobby Harris grew up on, and where the band worked as a house band. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheeks|first1=Dwayne|title=Dazz aims to perfect its pizazz|work=The Plain Dealer|issue=pg. 24|date=December 31, 1982|ref=Cheeks}}</ref> The Dazz Band adopted its name prior to the release of the song "Dazz" which became an R&B hit for [[Atlanta|Atlanta\'s]] [[Brick (band)|Brick]] in 1976 as the groups Founder/ Leader Jimmy Brown confirms.

Kinsman Dazz was signed to [[20th Century Records]] in 1977 and the group expanded from the original quintet consisting of Harris, Calhoun, Pettus, and the Wiley brothers and adding newcomers Ed Meyers (trombone), Wayne Preston (saxophonist), and Les Thaler (trumpet). In 1977, the group went to [[Los Angeles]] to record with producer [[Marvin Gaye]]. Due to illness, Gaye was unable to complete the project. Leader Michael J Calhoun requested and got [[Philip Bailey]], the vocalist of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], to produce the group\'s first album \'\'Kinsman Dazz\'\'. They released their first single, "I Might as Well Forget About Loving You" in 1978. Philip Bailey made significant contributions to the group\'s vocal arrangements and overall sound.  He went on to co-produce the second album, \'\'Dazz\'\' in 1979 when the band achieved their second charting hit "Catchin\' Up On Love".

In 1980, The Kinsman Dazz changed its name to The Dazz Band after being signed to [[Motown Records]] which simultaneously included a re-organization of members.   Wayne Preston, Les Thaler were no longer with the group and Sennie "Skip" Martin, (trumpet, vocalist) Pierre DeMudd (trumpet, vocalist) and Kevin Kendricks (keyboards) were added.  In 1981 guitarist Eric Fearman was also added.

The Dazz Band\'s first album for Motown was \'\'Invitation to Love\'\'(1980).  The bands title track "Invitation to Love", began a string of hits  starting in March, 1981. The group\'s next album, \'\'Let The Music Play\'\' (1981), featured the hit single "Knock! Knock!", reaching the Top 50. The Dazz Band\'s breakthrough came with the hit "[[Let It Whip]]"  written and produced by Reggie Andrews off of the \'\'Keep It Live\'\' (1982) album ."(Let It Whip)" reached No. 1 on the R&B charts, and achieved a [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Grammy Award]] and continues in recurring radio and [[Sirius XM]] rotation. Members of the Grammy Award Winning Dazz Band included: Sennie "Skip" Martin, Pierre DeMudd, Bobby Harris, Eric Fearman, Kenny Pettus, Steve Cox, Keith Harrison, Michael Wiley & Isaac Wiley. Reggie Andrews  masterful knowledge of music and smooth temperament brought musical stability that would make an everlasting mark on The Dazz Band\'s history.  On December 31, 1982 during The Dazz Band\'s New Year\'s Eve concert at the Front Row in Cleveland, Mayor George V. Voinovich presented Bobby Harris and The Dazz Band with the Key to the City of Cleveland with proclamations from the State of Ohio.<ref name=Stunek>{{cite news|last1=Stunek|first1=Jim|title=The Dazz Band: turning music into money|work=Scene Newspaper, Cleveland|issue=pg. 7|date=January 20, 1983}}</ref>  The Dazz Band continued to score R&B hits with the songs such as "Party Right Here" (1983), "On the One For Fun" (1983) "[[Joystick (song)|Joystick]]" (1983), and "Let It All Blow" (also their biggest [[United Kingdom|UK]] hit single, peaking at #12) (1984).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

Reggie Andrews produced five Dazz Band albums including: \'\'Let The Music Play\'\' (1981), \'\'Keep It Live\'\' (1982), \'\'On the One\'\' (1983), \'\'Joystick\'\' (1983), \'\'Jukebox\'\' (1984) under the Motown label.  The album \'\'Hot Spot\'\' (1985) also under Motown, was produced by Bobby Harris.  The Dazz Band was known for its high energy live performances, often proving more popular than the headlining act. After winning the Grammy in 1982, Keith Harrison (1983)(vocalist, keyboards) was added to the group.  In 1985 both Eric Fearman and Sennie "Skip" Martin (trumpet, vocalist) left the group and were replaced by guitarist Marlon McClain; and the search began for additional vocalists that would match The Dazz Band sound.  In 1986, The Dazz Band recorded \'\'Wild & Free\'\' (1986) featuring Jerry Bell as lead vocalist on the Wild & Free album and other Dazz Band songs[[Geffen Records]].  While also featured on some background vocals on the \'\'Wild & Free\'\' album, and Time Traveler. Jerry Bell contributed on other recordings with The Dazz Band. The Dazz Band signed with RCA records in 1988 and released the album \'\'Rock the Room\'\' which charted with the single \'\'Anticipation\'\' featuring vocals from Juan Lively (vocalist).  From 1994-2001 Terry Stanton (vocalist) contributed on the following albums including: \'\'Funkology\'\' (1994), and \'\'Under the Streetlights\'\' (1995) Lucky Records.  After 20 years as lead vocalist with Kool & The Gang, Skip Martin returned to The Dazz Band in 1998, and shared lead vocals with Terry Stanton on the albums \'\'Here We Go Again\'\' (1998) on  Intersound Records, and \'\'Time Traveler\'\' (2001) on Major Hits Records.

===1990s Revival===
Following the infusion of rap into American music, many classic Funk/R&B/Soul acts performing in the US began performing abroad.  In the late 1990\'s Bobby Harris, along with the support of business entrepreneur Bo Boviard and long time friend and band member Marlon McClain, decided to revitalize funk in America and called upon members from the [[BarKays]], [[Confunkshun]], Charlie Wilson of The Gap Band the [[The SOS Band|SOS Band]], and The Dazz Band, for a project entitled \'United We Funk All-Stars\'. <ref name=Pantsios /> A studio album followed that included the late [[Roger Troutman]] of Zapp.  The concept was a success, and was captured on a live CD (Major Hits Records)<ref name=Pantsios /> promoted by [[syndicated radio host]] Tom Joyner. Tom Joyner became the featured host for the UWF-All Stars shows.  The \'United We Funk All-Stars\' successful concept set the template of using one common rhythm section to back multiple  Artists; a template that is emulated by many touring Artists today.  September 23, 2000 issue of Billboard Magazine also credited Bobby Harris as the instigator behind Charlie Wilson\'s first solo project \'\'Bridging The Gap\'\' serving as an executive producer on the album also on the Major Hits Record label.  The album achieved a #1 hit single "Without You."

\'\'\'DeBarge\'\'\' was a [[DeBarge family|sibling]] [[music]] [[band (music)|group]] of American origin whose repertoire included [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]. Active as a professional recording group from 1979 to 1989, the group was one of the few recording acts to bring success to the [[Motown Records|Motown]] label during the 1980s.

==Overview==

===Background===
Hailing from the East Side of [[Detroit]] where the siblings were born and raised, they later relocated to [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], the group is named for their shared surname, and included sister [[Bunny DeBarge|Bunny]] and the brothers [[Mark DeBarge|Mark]] (or "Marty"),  [[Randy DeBarge|Randy]], [[El DeBarge|Eldra]] (or "El"), and [[James DeBarge|James]].Younger [[sibling]]s [[Chico DeBarge|Chico]], Darell, and Carol "Peaches" DeBarge are also [[singer]]s (though they were not with the group), with El later becoming a [[solo (music)|solo]] star in his own right. Two older brothers, Robert Jr. ([[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]]) and [[Tommy DeBarge|Tommy]], were members of another popular [[Motown Records|Motown]] group named [[Switch (band)|Switch]]. The DeBarges signed with the Motown [[record label]] in the late 1970s, and became one of their few successful acts during the 1980s.

The band had a string of hits in the early to mid-1980s, including "All This Love," "I Like It," "Love Me in a Special Way," and "Rhythm of the Night."  Many of these hits were ballads, spreading the band\'s appeal into the [[adult contemporary]] market as well.  However, in 1986, both [[El DeBarge|El]] and [[Bunny DeBarge]] left for solo careers.  The remaining brothers soldiered on with their older brother [[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]] (who\'d long since left [[Switch (band)|Switch]]) now joining the band to release the album \'\'[[Bad Boys (DeBarge album)|Bad Boys]]\'\' in 1987, but it didn\'t achieve nearly the success of previous releases.  Meanwhile, [[El DeBarge|El]] went on to have a moderately successful solo career, and [[Bunny DeBarge|Bunny]] would score a minor hit with "Save the Best for Me (Best of Your Lovin\')" from her only solo album before being abruptly dropped by her label. Overall, DeBarge released nine Top 40 R&B singles, five top 40 pop singles, two pop top ten hits, five top ten R&B singles, two number-one R&B singles, a number-one single on the dance chart and three number-one hits on the adult contemporary chart.

==History==

===Early years===
The members that eventually became DeBarge started performing in various groups together in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area in the mid-1970s. In 1979, brothers Randy, Mark and El were part of the SMASH band, which was a release on Source Records/MCA in the USA/Canada, before released as Pall Mall Groove HOT ICE in Germany by Polydor, with Bernd Lichters, who rented a home in Cerritos, CA, bought them instruments,  were being mentored by members of the Motown group [[Switch (band)|Switch]], including their elder brothers Tommy and [[Bobby DeBarge|Bobby]] and co-founding member and family friend Gregory Williams. Bunny DeBarge had joined her younger brothers in 1979 as well and they formed as The DeBarges in 1980. That year, El was able because of the success of his older brother Bobby with Switch, to perform live on the piano and sing for Motown CEO and founder [[Berry Gordy]], who was impressed by the group and agreed to sign them that year. For a year, the group worked alongside members of Switch, helping to add background vocals, instrumentation, arranging, and musical and lyrical composition to the band\'s works, much prominently, "I Call Your Name", "My Friend in the Sky", and "Love Over and Over Again".

By 1981, Bobby DeBarge and Tommy DeBarge had left Switch and returned the favor to their siblings working with them on their [[The DeBarges|debut album]], which was released that year with Bobby, Bunny, and El as main producers. The only single, the Randy-led ballad "What\'s Your Name", failed to chart.

=== Success ===

In 1982, they included their 18-year-old brother James into the lineup and worked on their second album, \'\'[[All This Love (album)|All This Love]]\'\', produced by El and Iris Gordy. The album launched them into R&B stardom with the records "[[I Like It (DeBarge song)|I Like It]]" and "[[All This Love (song)|All This Love]]". Both songs also became crossover pop hits with "All This Love" later going to number one on Billboard\'s adult contemporary chart. In 1983, the group made an impression after appearing on \'\'[[Motown 25]]\'\', where they performed alongside [[High Inergy]]. Their performance together ended in a standing ovation. Later in 1983, the group issued their third album, \'\'[[In a Special Way]]\'\', which spawned two further hit singles, "[[Time Will Reveal (song)|Time Will Reveal]]" and "[[Love Me in a Special Way]]". Like \'\'All This Love\'\' before it, the album reached gold status in the United States.

Following that album\'s success, DeBarge were handpicked by [[Luther Vandross]] to open for him on his "Busy Body Tour" to support [[Busy Body|his album of the same name]]. Vandross discovered the band\'s popularity while waiting for his set to begin, shocked at the attention the group got, which group members later compared to "[[Beatlemania]]" and Motown\'s early phenomenon, [[The Jackson 5]], which DeBarge was molded to follow after by its staff. When the tour ended in late 1984, the group recorded the [[Diane Warren]] composition, "[[Rhythm of the Night (song)|Rhythm of the Night]]", for the soundtrack to the Motown-produced film, [[Berry Gordy]]\'s \'\'[[The Last Dragon]]\'\' from 1985. The song was released in early 1985 and became a smash single, eventually reaching the top five in several countries, mainly in the US and UK, becoming the band\'s biggest-selling hit and their best-known hit. Sensing that El DeBarge was emerging as the "star" of the group, Motown had El working on the group\'s next album primarily by himself, with the label failing to call on the other siblings\' help. It\'s hinted Motown was fearful of the other members\' growing dependencies to drug addiction, only trusting El as he seemed to be the most reliable. In 1984, James DeBarge made headlines when he secretly eloped with [[Janet Jackson]] of the famed [[Jackson family]]. Their marriage was annulled the following year.

The \'\'[[Rhythm of the Night (album)|Rhythm of the Night]]\'\' album became the band\'s best-selling work, going platinum and featuring further hits such as "[[Who\'s Holding Donna Now]]" and "You Wear It Well". Following the end of its promotion, both El and Bunny DeBarge departed from the group after Motown offered them solo deals. The rest of the DeBarges were dropped from Motown in 1986. Meanwhile, El found immediate solo success with the single, "Who\'s Johnny?", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1986 hit film \'\'[[Short Circuit (1986 film)|Short Circuit]]\'\'.

===Decline===
Failing to find deals with major labels, the rest of the DeBarges, with Bobby now joining the fold, signed with the independent Striped Horse Records in 1987, later releasing what turned out to be their final studio album, \'\'[[Bad Boys (DeBarge album)|Bad Boys]]\'\'. Striped Horse had problems promoting the album and without the help of Motown, the album tanked. DeBarge continued their career into 1988, even bringing along younger brother [[Chico DeBarge|Chico]] (then riding off the success of his hit "Talk to Me"), with them. The brothers made a guest appearance on \'\'[[Punky Brewster]]\'\' in 1988. That same year, Bobby and Chico DeBarge were arrested for [[drug trafficking]] in their native Grand Rapids hometown. They were eventually convicted of drug charges and sentenced to two different prisons to serve their sentences. The arrests and subsequent convictions brought an end to DeBarge as a musical group and they disbanded at the end of the eighties. In 1991, Randy and James contributed to a gospel album featuring their mother Etterlene and younger siblings Darryl (Young DeBarge) and Carol (Peaches DeBarge).

The group\'s since highly publicized drug addictions have been well documented with several members serving jail time for drug offenses. The siblings have continued to perform together on some occasions. In 2011, members James, Randy and Bunny appeared on [[Dr. Drew]]\'s \'\'[[Lifechangers]]\'\' where they discussed their troubles with drug addiction, later agreeing to attend a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation facility]]. While Randy and James left the facility on a follow-up episode, Bunny DeBarge still attends and told Dr. Drew of her recovery on the follow-up episode later performing a gospel song on the show. El DeBarge returned from a 16-year sabbatical of releasing solo albums following a period of drug addiction and several arrests with the well-received Grammy-nominated album, \'\'[[Second Chance (album)|Second Chance]]\'\'. The group members have suffered several setbacks and tragedies over the years brought on by drug abuse: Bobby DeBarge died at a hospice in Grand Rapids after contracting [[AIDS]] following years of [[heroin]] addiction; Tommy DeBarge, who also suffered drug addiction, is under kidney dialysis but has nonetheless continued to perform, sometimes with surviving members of Switch and with his family members; Randy DeBarge and Mark DeBarge are said to have "incurable diseases," according to their mother. James DeBarge recently was sentenced to prison for drug offenses. The DeBarges\' story of their rise and fall was documented in late 2008 as the debut episode of the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] show, \'\'[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]\'\'.

==Legacy==
Though DeBarge never fully recovered from their 1986 fallout, the group\'s classic Motown material has been either frequently sampled or covered over the years. Their collaborations with Switch on their recordings, "I Call Your Name" and "My Friend in the Sky" have been sampled as well as their own material, including "I Like It", "[[Stay with Me (DeBarge song)|Stay with Me]]" and "[[A Dream (DeBarge song)|A Dream]]".

Some of the most prominent samples of DeBarge\'s material including [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]\'s remix of "[[One More Chance (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|One More Chance]]", which sampled "Stay With Me". [[Mary J. Blige]], a fan of DeBarge, has also sampled and covered their work, including "Share My World" (adding the group\'s intro ad-libs from that song on her song of the same name), "A Dream" and "Don\'t Go" (which interpolated the ending of "Stay With Me"). Rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] interpolated the melody of "A Dream" for his posthumous hit, "[[I Ain\'t Mad at Cha]]", just little over a few months later, [[Blackstreet]] sampled the song\'s music for their hit, "[[Don\'t Leave Me]]". Blackstreet were big fans of DeBarge (Teddy Riley called El DeBarge a living legend on the liner notes of Blackstreet\'s 1994 debut album) and had covered "I Like It". On their platinum album, \'\'[[Another Level (Blackstreet album)|Another Level]]\'\', the group did a gospel version of DeBarge\'s hit "Time Will Reveal".

In 1998, Riley sampled parts of Switch\'s "My Friend in the Sky" (co-composed by Bobby, Bunny and El) for rapper [[Queen Pen]]\'s album track, "No Hooks" off her \'\'[[My Melody (Queen Pen album)|My Melody]]\'\' album. The same song would be sampled in 2005 for [[Raheem DeVaughn]]\'s title track off \'\'[[The Love Experience]]\'\'. The melody of "Stay With Me" was revisited by [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]] on her single, "[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]" and later by [[Mariah Carey]] on her single [[I\'ll Be Lovin\' U Long Time]] from [[E=MC\xc2\xb2]], while the melody of "A Dream" has been constantly sampled following the recordings of "I Ain\'t Mad at Cha" and "Don\'t Leave Me". "I Like It" is their most sampled, with several acts sampling the music or interpolating the song\'s popular bridge (sung by El and written by Bunny). In 2007, [[Rich Boy]]\'s hit "[[Throw Some D\'s]]" sampled Switch\'s "I Call Your Name", which was co-written by Bobby and arranged by Bobby and El. "All This Love" has also been covered and sampled frequently by other artists.
  
In 2011, Motown Records/Hip-O Select released the three-disc set Time Will Reveal: The Complete Motown Albums. This collection presents all four Motown/Gordy albums, spread out over the first two discs, and offers a third disc containing remixes, rarities and unreleased material.

\'\'\'Emmanuel "Manu" N\'Djok\xc3\xa9 Dibango\'\'\' (born 12 December 1933) is a Cameroonian saxophonist and [[vibraphone]] player. He developed a musical style fusing jazz, funk and traditional Cameroonian music. His father was a member of the [[Bassa (Cameroon)|Yabassi]] ethnic group, though his mother was a [[Duala people|Duala]]. He is best known for his 1972 single "[[Soul Makossa]]".

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dibango was born in [[Douala]], Cameroon. His father, Michel Manfred N\'Djok\xc3\xa9 Dibango<ref>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=xii}}</ref> was a civil servant. The son of a farmer, he met his wife travelling by [[pirogue]] to her residence, Douala.<ref name=Dibango1>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=1}}</ref> A literate woman, she was a fashion designer, running her own small business.<ref name=Dibango4/> Both her ethnicity, the [[Duala people|Duala]], and his, the [[Yabassi (people)|Yabassi]], viewed this union of different ethnic groups with some disdain.<ref name=Dibango1/> Emmanuel had no siblings, although he had a stepbrother from his father\'s previous marriage<ref name=Dibango2>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=2}}</ref> who was four years older than he was.<ref name=Dibango8>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=8}}</ref> In Cameroon, one\'s ethnicity is dictated by their fathers, though he wrote in his autobiography, \'\'Three Kilos of Coffee\'\', that he has "never been able to identify completely with either of [his] parents."<ref name=Dibango2/>

Dibango\'s uncle was the leader of his extended family. Upon his death, Dibango\'s father refused to take over, as he never fully initiated his son into the Yabassi\'s customs. Throughout his childhood, Dibango slowly forgot the [[Yabassi language]] in favour of the [[Duala langauage|Duala]]. However, his family did live in the Yabassi encampment on the [[Yabassi plateau]], close to the [[Wouri River]] in central Douala.<ref name=Dibango2/> While a child, Dibango attended [[Protestant]] church every night for religious education, or \'\'nkouaida\'\'. He enjoyed studying music there, and reportedly was a fast learner.<ref name=Dibango4>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=4}}</ref>

In 1941, after being educated at his village school,<ref name="rfimusique">{{citation |url=http://www.rfimusique.com/siteen/biographie/biographie_6095.asp |title=Biography&nbsp;\xe2\x80\x93 Manu Dibango|year=2007|newspaper=[[Radio France Internationale]]|accessdate=9 September 2008}}</ref> Dibango was accepted into a colonial school, near his home, where he learned French. He admired the teacher, whom he described as "an extraordinary draftsman and painter."<ref>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=5}}</ref> In 1944, French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] chose this school to perform the welcoming ceremonies upon his arrival in Cameroon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dibango|Rouard|Raps|1994|p=6}}</ref>

===Career===
He was a member of the seminal Congolese rumba group [[Grand Kalle et l\'African Jazz|African Jazz]], and has collaborated with many other musicians, including [[Fania All Stars]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], [[King Sunny Ad\xc3\xa9]], [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], and [[Sly and Robbie]]. In 1998 he recorded the album \'\'CubAfrica\'\' with Cuban artist [[Eliades Ochoa]].

[[File:Manu dibango.jpg|thumb|Manu Dibango, 2010]]
The song "Soul Makossa" on the record of the same name contains the lyrics "makossa", which means "(I) dance" in his native tongue, the Cameroonian language, [[Duala language|Duala]]). It has influenced several popular music hits, including [[Michael Jackson]]\'s "[[Wanna Be Startin\' Somethin\']]", as well as his re-recording of that song with [[Akon]], the [[Fugees]]\' "Cowboys", and [[Rihanna]]\'s "[[Don\'t Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don\'t Stop the Music]]". The 1982 [[parody]] song "[[Boogie in your butt]]" by comedian [[Eddie Murphy]] [[Interpolation (music)|interpolates]] Soul Makossa\'s bassline and horn charts while "[[Butt Naked Booty Bless]]" by 1990s hip-hop group [[Poor Righteous Teachers]] heavily [[Sampling (music)|samples]] its musical bridge and drum patterns.

He served as the first chairman of the Cameroon Music Corporation, with a high profile in disputes about artists\' [[royalties]]. Dibango was appointed a [[UNESCO Artist for Peace]] in 2004.<ref>Ernest Kanjo, "Cameroonian musicians seem to have lost their creative acumen in their endless battles over money", Post newsmagazine, Sept 2006 accessed at [http://www.postnewsmagazine.com/pages/art03.htm] 5 April 2007</ref><ref>[http://portal0.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=25547&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Manu Dibango designated UNESCO Artist for Peace]</ref>

His song "[[Reggae Makossa]]" is featured on the soundtrack to the 2006 video game \'\'[[Scarface: The World Is Yours]]\'\'. In August 2009 he played the closing concert at the revived Brecon Jazz Festival. In July 2014 he made an 80th anniversary concert at Olympia, France which was broadcast by TV5Monde.

 ****** Directions In Groove

b'\'\'\'Directions In Groove (DIG)\'\'\' are a popular [[Australian]] [[acid jazz]] band originally from the suburb of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] in [[Sydney]], who produced several distinctive [[acid-jazz]] / [[Groove (music)|groove]] / [[funk]] albums in the 1990s. Originally known as "dig" and performing instrumental acid jazz, the band became popular with a Sunday night residency at Kinselas, a venue on Oxford St in Sydney. Word quickly spread and the band was soon on the road and recorded an EP titled "Directions in Groove" which was the highest selling independent release of its era and attracted Polygram records to sign the band in 1993.

The band continued to tour and recorded their first full length CD "Deeper" in 1994 also officially changing their name to Directions in Groove due to the fact that there was a group from Canada called dig touring internationally at the time. The success of Deeper in Australia (No.3 on the Album Charts) led to international release (Verve) and tours throughout Australia and Europe.

DIG released several albums on the [[EMI]] Australia and [[Polygram]] labels, with "Speakeasy" and "Deeper" achieving double platinum status.  DIG have also toured the world, playing alongside artists such [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Bootsy Collins]].

The original DIG lineup featured keyboardist and vocalist Scott Saunders, saxophonist [[Rick Robertson]], guitarist [[Tim Rollinson]], bassist Alex Hewetson and drummer [[Terepai Richmond]].  The band\'s most popular tracks include "The Favourite", "Reinvent Yourself", and "Hip Replacement". Hewetson was replaced by [[Samuel Dixon]] after he joined [[Swoop (Australian band)|Swoop]].

DIG were also famous for their live performances at The Basement, a club situated in the heart of [[Sydney]], near Circular Quay which has been a landmark of the Australian music scene since the early 1970s.

The original members of the group reformed in the wake of playing to a packed crowd in June 2008. They subsequently recorded their fourth studio album (the first in 13 years). The new album "Clearlight" was released on 14 October 2011.

Rolling Stone magazine once stated "DIG are the future of Australian music. They know what to do and how to do it."

\'\'\'George Duke\'\'\' (January 12, 1946 &ndash; August 5, 2013) was an American musician, known as a [[Keyboardist|keyboard]] pioneer, composer, singer and producer in both [[jazz]] and popular mainstream musical [[genres]]. He worked with numerous acclaimed artists as arranger, music director, writer and co-writer, record producer and as a professor of music. He first made a name for himself with the album \'\'[[The Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio]]\'\'. He was known primarily for thirty-odd solo albums as well as for his collaborations with other musicians, particularly [[Frank Zappa]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Duke attended [[Tamalpais High School]] in [[Mill Valley]] before earning a [[bachelor\'s degree]] in [[trombone]] and [[Musical composition|composition]] with a minor in [[contrabass]], from the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music|San Francisco Conservatory]] in 1967.<ref name="Official site/biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeduke.com/biography.html|title=George Duke biography|publisher=George Duke online|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref> Playing initially with friends from garages to local clubs, Duke quickly eased his way into session work, which refined his abilities and expanded his approach to music. He later earned his Masters Degree in composition from [[San Francisco State University]]. He also taught a course on Jazz And American Culture at [[Merritt College]] in Oakland.<ref name="Official site/biography"/>

===Career===
Beginning in 1967 Duke experimented further with [[jazz fusion]], playing and recording with violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], as well as performing with the [[Don Ellis Orchestra]], and [[Cannonball Adderley]]\'s band, while he acquainted himself with [[Frank Zappa]].<ref name=AllmusicL/> Duke appeared on a number of Frank Zappa\'s albums through the 1970s.

Frank Zappa played guitar solos on Duke\'s 1974 album, \'\'Feel\'\' - the instrumental "Old Slipper," and "Love" - credited as Obdewl\'l X,<ref name=Watson>Watson, Ben, \'\'Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play\'\', St Martin\'s Press, New York, 1993, p. 294.</ref> possibly due to contractual reasons.

Duke covered two Zappa-composed songs on his 1975 album, \'\'The Aura Will Prevail\'\',<ref name=Watson /> - "Uncle Remus" (co-written with Duke) and "Echidna\'s Arf" - that he had played on while a member of The Mothers on Zappa\'s albums.  

A further Zappa connection occurred on Duke\'s other album from 1975, \'\'I Love the Blues She Heard Me Cry\'\' - which utilized [[Ruth Underwood]], Tom Fowler, and Bruce Fowler from Zappa\'s [[Overnite Sensation]] band that Duke was a part of, along with Zappa-associate [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]]<ref name=Watson /> and jazz guitarist [[Lee Ritenour]].<ref>\'\'I Love the Blues She Heard Me Cry\'\', MPS Records-BAP 5071/BASF 5071/MPS Records MC 25671, 1975, sleeve notes</ref> 

Duke served as a record producer and composer on two instrumental tracks on [[Miles Davis]] albums: "Backyard Ritual" (from \'\'[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]\'\', 1986) and "Cobra" (from \'\'[[Amandla (album)|Amandla]]\'\', 1989). He has also worked with a number of notable Brazilian musicians, including singer [[Milton Nascimento]], percussionist [[Airto Moreira]] and singer [[Flora Purim]]. [[Sheila E]] appeared on Duke\'s late-1970s solo albums \'\'Don\'t Let Go\'\' and \'\'Master of the Game\'\'.

Duke was prominent in the [[R&B]] genre, releasing funk-based songs like "Reach for It" and "Dukey Stick". In 1979 he traveled to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he recorded the album \'\'A Brazilian Love Affair\'\', on which he employed singers [[Flora Purim]] and [[Milton Nascimento]] and percussionist [[Airto Moreira]]. The album contained music in a wide assortment of genres, including some Latin jazz and jazz-influenced material. From a jazz standpoint, the album\'s most noteworthy songs include Nascimento\'s "Cravo e Canela," "Love Reborn", and "Up from the Sea It Arose and Ate Rio in One Swift Bite." The track "Brazilian Sugar" was featured on the 2006 video game \'\'[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 2]]\'\'. Meanwhile, Nascimento\'s vocal on the ballad "Ao Que Vai Nascer" is an example of Brazilian pop at its most sensuous. The 1992 film \'\'[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]\'\' featured gospel songs and choir produced by George Duke and choir master [[Edwin Hawkins]].

Duke worked as musical director at numerous large-scale musical events, including the [[Nelson Mandela]] tribute concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]], London in 1988. In 1989, he temporarily replaced [[Marcus Miller]] as musical director of [[NBC]]\'s acclaimed late-night music performance program \'\'[[Sunday Night (American TV program)|Sunday Night]]\'\' during its first season.<ref>"Sunday Night" episodes No.104 (1988), No.113 (1989), No.114 (1989), No.121 (1989)</ref>  Duke was also a judge for the second annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists\' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Independent Music Awards |publisher=Independent Music Awards |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>

Duke worked with [[Jill Scott]] on her third studio album, \'\'[[The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3]]\'\'; guesting on the track, "[[Whenever You\'re Around]]". In the summer of 2011, he put together a trio with [[David Sanborn]] and [[Marcus Miller]] for a tour across the US of more than 20 sold out shows.

===Legacy & influence===
Duke died August 5, 2013 in Los Angeles from [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]]. He was 67 and is survived by his sons, Rashid and John. He is buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=821730&ocid=ansent11 |title=Jazz keyboardist George Duke dies at 67 - MSN Music News |publisher=Music.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref>

Duke\'s songs have been used by a wide variety of contemporary musicians in a wide array of genres.

[[Madlib]] utilized Duke\'s "My Soul" on the track "Mingus" from his "[[Madlib Medicine Show]] #8: Advanced Jazz" album.

Duke was nominated for a [[Grammy]] as [[Best Contemporary Jazz Performance]] for \'\'After Hours\'\' in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Duke|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/george-duke|publisher=answers.com|accessdate=6 August 2013}}</ref>  By popular vote, Duke was inducted into The SoulMusic Hall Of Fame at SoulMusic.com in December 2012.<ref name="soulmusic1">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.com/halloffame.html |title=SoulMusic.com |publisher=SoulMusic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-04}}</ref>

\'\'\'Dumpstaphunk\'\'\' is a [[funk]] and [[jam band|jam]] band from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], United States.

==Origins and background==
The quintet\'s current lineup features [[Ivan Neville]] on vocals, B3 and Clav, the double bass attack and soulful voices of [[Tony Hall (musician)|Tony Hall]] and [[Nick Daniels III]], [[Ian Neville]] on guitar, and [[Nikki Glaspie]] on drums and vocals.

Formed in 2003, [[Ivan Neville]]\'s Dumpstaphunk was initially put together by keyboardist Ivan Neville on a whim in order to perform a solo gig at the [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]]. Ivan called in cousin [[Ian Neville]] (guitar), the double-bass bottom of both [[Nick Daniels]] and [[Tony Hall (musician)|Tony Hall]], and drummer [[Raymond Weber]] (no longer in the band) to round out the show. The band was voted 2007\'s "New Orleans Best Funk Band" by both [[Offbeat Magazine]] and [[Gambit Weekly]], and performs at some of the nation\'s largest music festivals such as Bonnaroo, Voodoo Fest, 10,000 Lakes, and High Sierra.<ref name="Dumpstaphunk Bio">{{cite web|title=Ivan Neville\'s Dumpstaphunk|url=http://www.jambase.com/Artists/28841/Ivan-Neville\'s-Dumpstaphunk/Bio|publisher=JamBase|accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref>

"Ivan is the son of Aaron Neville, and he joined his father along with two uncles \xe2\x80\x94 Art Neville of the Meters, who defined New Orleans funk, and Cyril Neville \xe2\x80\x94 in the Neville Brothers before starting Dumpstaphunk. Their funk follows through on the Nevilles\xe2\x80\x99 distinctive style: a complex of syncopations developed from sudden bass lunges, chattery drumming, hooting keyboard chords and wah-wah guitar."<ref>{{cite web|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Jazzfest: What\xe2\x80\x99s That Funky Smell?|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/jazzfest-whats-that-funky-smell/|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

==Musical style==
\'\'[[The New York Times]]\'\' stated, "Dumpstaphunk is the best funk band from New Orleans right now."<ref>{{cite web|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=THE WEEK AHEAD: June 3 - 9; POP|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E5DB1430F930A35755C0A9619C8B63|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

From annual performances at New Orleans\' Jazz Fest -- "The colossal low end and filthy grooves they threw down from the Gentilly Stage must have set a Jazz Fest record for baddest bass jams ever." (Bass Player Magazine, 2012)<ref>{{cite web|last=Leslie|first=Jimmy|title=Dumpstaphunk\xe2\x80\x99s Tony Hall & Nick Daniels|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/TabId/177/Default.aspx?ArticleId=5289|work=Bass Player Magazine|publisher=Bass Player Magazine|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>\xe2\x80\x94to music rooms and festivals across the nation ([[Bonnaroo]], [[Wakarusa Music and Camping Festival|Wakarusa]], [[All Good]], [[High Sierra Music Festival|High Sierra]] and beyond), Dumpstaphunk continues to spread an unmistakably New Orleans groove with hard-hitting performances that dare listeners not to move.

"We always keep the spontaneity going, that\xe2\x80\x99s something I love about this band," says Ivan. "We can funk it out with the best of them, but we also like to showcase how all sorts of music can come together and push the boundaries of what funk music is."<ref>{{cite web|last=Frazier|first=Jeremy|title=Preview & Ticket Giveaway for Dumpstaphunk and Dragon Smoke at Metro on February 2nd / Interview with Ivan Neville|url=http://soundfusemag.com/2013/01/30/preview-ticket-giveaway-for-dumpstaphunk-and-dragon-smoke-at-metro-on-february-1st-interview-with-ivan-neville/|work=SoundFuse Magazine|publisher=SoundFuse Magazine|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

One critic said, "Dumpstaphunk\xe2\x80\x99s groove is a unique monster. It\'s not the minimalist funk of [[The Meters]] and it\xe2\x80\x99s not the relentless funk of [[James Brown]], although it has that rhythmic drive. It\'s not the psychedelic, over-the-top circus of [[Parliament Funkadelic]], but it often has that political slant. It\'s not the party funk of the [[Ohio Players]], but it shares the high vocals that take the pressure off the bottom. Dumpstaphunk is a whole other school of funk. If you\'re under 35, you think you\'ve seen funk, but you haven\'t. You missed the original Meters, James Brown when he wasn\'t a parody, Parliament Funkadelic\'s landing of the [[Mothership]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]] before he went M.I.A and [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] before the demise of Stax. Dumpstaphunk is as good as all that, and they\'re in their prime now."<ref>{{cite web|last=Fensterstock|first=Alison|title=Voodoo Music Previews|url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/voodoo-music-previews/Content?oid=1251656|work=Gambit Weekly|publisher=Gambit Weekly|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>

==Upcoming releases==
Dumpstaphunk\'s third album, second full-length record, "Dirty Word" released on July 30, 2013. The record featured 11 songs, with special appearances by Trombone Shorty, Ani DiFranco, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rebirth Brass Band, Art Neville and the Grooveline Horns. Ivan Neville said, "The whole record speaks to the righteousness of music. We\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily telling a specific story, but expressing how music makes things right for everyone in their own way. Our fans can feel that vibe and let it take them wherever they need to."<ref>{{cite web|last=Atlanta|first=Mixtape|title=Dumpstaphunk interview at MidSummer Music Festival 2010|url=https://vimeo.com/12798846|work=Vimeo|publisher=Vimeo|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>

"We just hope to spread the good word through funk," added Glaspie. "If we can create an escape, give people a reason to get down and forget their problems, then we\'re doing what we set out to do."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gustav|first=Hurricane|title=Dumpstaphunk interview part 1 Tatanka Music Festival 9-27-08|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEixd3V6_oc|work=MoBoogie|publisher=MoBoogie|accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>

==Recent releases==
"Listen Hear provides at long-last the aural, syncopated nastiness listeners have been denied outside of a Dumpstaphunk live performance. Saxophonic magician, Skerik, also guests on the EP. Ivan Neville\'s Dumpstaphunk is not re-writing the book so much as adding a much needed new testament. While fortunate enough to stand upon the shoulders of giants, make no mistake \xe2\x80\x93 Listen Hear is not an attempt at world music or feel-good vibrations, like that of some of their counterparts, but rather straight-ahead inner city funk for the masses. Tracks like "Living in a World Gone Mad" and "Turn This Thing Around" describe the troubling times we live in, while songs like "Meanwhile" and "Shake" suggest accepting such times in order to enjoy life."<ref name="JamBase">"Founders Ivan Neville and Ian Neville (sons of both Aaron Neville and Art Neville respectively), along with Nick Daniels, Tony Hall, and Raymond Weber, were brought up in an atmosphere of sounds that have arguably become the most defining in all of New Orleans music. But don\'t let the pedigree of lineage from the Meters and Neville Brothers fool you either. Ivan Neville\'s Dumpstaphunk now stands on its own as the legitimate torchbearer of all things funky both in New Orleans and beyond."</ref>

\'\'\'Dyke and the Blazers\'\'\' was an influential [[United States|American]] [[funk]] [[band (music)|band]] led by \'\'\'Arlester Christian\'\'\' (June 13, 1943&ndash;March 13, 1971).  The band was formed in 1965 and recorded until 1971, when Christian died.  Among their most successful records were the original version of "[[Funky Broadway]]" (1966) and "Let A Woman Be A Woman, Let A Man Be A Man" (1969).

==Career==
Arlester Christian, nicknamed "Dyke", was born (according to most sources) in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dyke-the-blazers-p17189/biography  Biography by Richie Unterberger at Allmusic.com]</ref>  He attended [[Burgard High School]].<ref>http://www.buffalomusic.org/2012_Arlester_Christian.html</ref> In 1960, he started playing bass in a Buffalo band, Carl LaRue and his Crew, who played local bars and clubs and released a [[single (music)|single]], "Please Don\'t Drive Me Away", on the KKC label in about 1963.<ref name=ploetz>[http://www.wnywebshop.com/ploetz/dyke.html  Elmer Ploetz, \'\'Buffalo\'s Soul Men\'\', The Buffalo News, August 11, 1991]</ref><ref name=soulful>[http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/dyke.htm  Dyke & The Blazers discography at SoulfulKindaMusic]</ref>  In 1964, LaRue was invited by [[Phoenix, Arizona]] [[disc jockey]] [[Eddie O\'Jay]] to take his band to that city, to provide the backing for the vocal group that he managed there, [[The O\'Jays]].  By 1965, however, the O\'Jays and their manager had moved elsewhere, and LaRue\'s band fell apart.  LaRue returned to Buffalo, but Christian and two other members of the band, guitarist Alvester "Pig" Jacobs and saxophonist J.V. Hunt, had no means of traveling and stayed in Phoenix.<ref name=ploetz/><ref name=allmusic/>  They joined forces with an existing Phoenix group, The Three Blazers, who included [[tenor saxophonist]] Bernard Williams,<ref name=soulful/> and, as "Dyke and the Blazers", added local musicians Rich Cason (organ) and Rodney Brown (drums).<ref name=azhall>[http://www.azmusichalloffame.org/pages/bio_dyke.html  Citation at Arizona Music Hall of Fame]</ref>  Playing in local clubs, the group picked up on the rhythms, bass and organ innovations of [[James Brown]]\'s band, and through [[improvisation]] developed a [[riff]]-based song that became "[[Funky Broadway]]", the lyrics reflecting singer Dyke\'s memories of Broadway in Buffalo as well as Broadway Street in Phoenix.<ref name=ploetz/>

In summer 1966, the band were heard by Art Barrett, who became their manager and had them record the song at the Audio Recorders Studio in Phoenix.  Barrett released the record on his own Artco label,<ref>[http://www.popsike.com/pix/20090316/330314800946.jpg Label shot of Artco release]</ref> with Christian credited as its writer although other band members later claimed that they had contributed to the song. It became popular locally, and was reissued by [[Art Laboe]]\'s [[Original Sound Records|Original Sound]] label in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=ploetz/>  The record steadily climbed the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]] early in 1967, reaching no. 17 in a 24-week stay on the chart, and also reached no. 65 on the [[Hot 100|pop chart]].<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=126}}</ref>  The record was the first to use the word "[[funk]]y" in its title, and for that reason was banned by some [[radio]] stations as offensive.<ref name=ploetz/>  Its music was described by [[Rick James]] as "revolutionary", and Dyke developed a dance routine to go with it.  The band added bass player Alvin Battle, freeing Dyke to concentrate on vocals, and toured widely on the back of its success.  However, in the summer of 1967, the stresses of playing a series of engagements at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] caused the band to split up, shortly before [[Wilson Pickett]] had a bigger hit with his own [[cover version]] of "Funky Broadway".<ref name=ploetz/>  Pickett\'s recording reached no. 1 on the R&B chart and no. 8 on the pop chart.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=349}}</ref>

Dyke returned to Buffalo, and put together a new touring band, including Willie Earl (drums - previously a member of Carl LaRue\'s band), Wardell "Baby Wayne" Peterson (second drummer), Otis Tolliver (bass), Ray Byrd (keyboards), and Maurice "Little Mo" Jones (trumpet).  However, the touring band gradually disintegrated in 1968 and 69.<ref name=ploetz/>  After 1968, Christian made Dyke and the Blazers records with a variety of Los Angeles studio musicians later known as the [[Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]], which included drummer [[James Gadson]], who also performed with [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band|Charles Wright]] and [[Bill Withers]], guitarists [[Al McKay]] and [[Roland Bautista]], who later became members of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], and bassists James Smith and Melvin Dunlap.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M3cqzbDc6dsC&pg=PA127&dq=%22arlester+christian%22&hl=en&ei=o8CKTuafIMLQ0QXon623BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22arlester%20christian%22&f=false  Interview with James Gadson in Jim Payne, \'\'The Great Drummers of R&B Funk & Soul\'\', Mel Bay Publications, 2006, p.127]</ref>  The resulting records, including "We Got More Soul" (no. 7 R&B, no. 35 pop) and "Let A Woman Be A Woman, Let A Man Be A Man" (no. 4 R&B, no. 36 pop), were among his biggest hits.<ref name="whitburnr&b"/>  Most of the singles resulted from lengthy [[jam session]]s that were edited down to fit the format of [[Gramophone record|45 rpm]] records.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=ace>[http://www.acerecords.co.uk/content.php?page_id=59&release=7429  Dyke And The Blazers, review by Alec Palao at Ace Records]</ref>  Dyke and the Blazers continued to have less sizeable hits into 1970, with a style described by critic [[Richie Unterberger]] as "gut-bucket funk... with scratchy guitar riffs, greasy organ, hoarse vocals, and jazzy horns".<ref name=allmusic/>

==Death==
Christian was preparing for a tour of [[England]] and for recording with [[Barry White]] when he was fatally shot on a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] street, on March 13, 1971, at the [[27 Club|age of 27]].  According to reports at the time, the killing may have been related to [[drug dealing]],<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kzcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=%22arlester+christian%22&hl=en&ei=o8CKTuafIMLQ0QXon623BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22arlester%20christian%22&f=false \'\'Jet\'\', 22 Apr 1971, p.62]</ref> although a coroner\'s report showed no alcohol or narcotics in his system.  The case against the alleged killer, Clarence Daniels, was dismissed because of "evidence indicating self-defense."<ref name=ploetz/>  Christian\'s body was returned to Buffalo for burial.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7368369   Arlester "Dyke" Christian at FindAGrave.com]</ref>

Dyke and the Blazers were inducted to the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame.<ref name=azhall/>

The song "[[Let a Woman Be a Woman]]" has been sampled by the [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] performer [[Tupac Shakur]] for his song "If my Homie Calls" and the band [[Stetsasonic]] for their song "Sally" and English indie rockers [[The Heavy (band)|The Heavy]] for their own "[[How You Like Me Now? (song)|How You Like Me Now?]]"  "Let a Woman" was also featured in the film \'\'[[Friends with Benefits (film)|Friends with Benefits]]\'\'.  The musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] during his "artist formerly known as..." period refers to "Let a Woman be a Woman" in his song "Gett Off."

According to the notes accompanying a recent DVD release of \'\'[[Mad Monster Party]]\'\', they allegedly recorded "The Mummy," voicing the animated skeletal rock band Little Tibia and the Fibias, although the song in the film does not sound much like any Dyke and the Blazers recordings and no credits exist to confirm this assumption.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2008/10/halloween-rocks/#more-3150 wired.com]</ref>

Compilations of Dyke and The Blazers recordings have been issued on CD by [[Kent Records]] and [[Ace Records (US)|Ace Records]].<ref name=ace/>

\'\'\'The Emotions\'\'\' are an [[United States|American]] female [[soul music|Soul]]/[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singing group from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], originally consisting of three sisters; Wanda Hutchinson, Shelia Hutchinson and Jeanette Hutchinson. The sisters are all children of Joseph and Lillian Hutchinson.

==History==

===Success with Earth, Wind & Fire and Beyond===
Their association with [[Maurice White]] of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] brought them their greatest success.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4190|label=The Emotions Biography}}</ref> With White\'s assistance, The Emotions released the albums \'\'[[Rejoice (The Emotions album)|Rejoice]]\'\' and \'\'[[Sunbeam (The Emotions album)|Sunbeam]]\'\' in 1977 and 1978. Maurice White and [[Clarence McDonald]] co-produced the single "[[Best of My Love (The Emotions song)|Best Of My Love]]" which spent five weeks at number one on the US pop chart in 1977.  Jeanette left in 1977, to give birth to her second child, Pili, and their youngest sister Pamela was brought in to record on the album \'\'Rejoice\'\' and perform live dates. In 1978, Jeanette returned to the group. In collaboration  with Earth, Wind & Fire, the group scored big with the single, "[[Boogie Wonderland]]", which was a top ten hit in 1979.  The group continued to record together during the 1980s, and were signed briefly with [[Motown Records]]. Their last recording to date was 1996\'s \'\'The Emotions Live\'\' released on their own record label Sunbeam Records.

===The Emotions today===
The current lineup of The Emotions consists of Wanda, Pamela, and Sheila Hutchinson. They continue to perform and make personal appearances. Wanda has three daughters, two of whom plan to enter the music industry themselves.
Wanda, Pamela, and Sheila Hutchinson performed on a PBS special on 70s soul music in 2004, singing "Best Of My Love".

In 2013, Wanda, Sheila, and Pam moved to Stardom Records record label, which is owned by The Stylistics lead singer and Smooth Jazz recording artist Eban Brown, and teamed up with rapper Snoop Dogg for a sultry Hip Hop/R&B single called "Life", written by Terrace Martin and the daughters of Wanda Vaughn.

[[Georgia Public Broadcasting]]. Retrieved October 28, 2012.</ref>
* Two of [[Mariah Carey]]\'s songs have sampled Emotions\' songs: "[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]" [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] "[[Best of My Love (The Emotions song)|Best of My Love]]", and "[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]" sampled "Blind Alley".<ref>Frere-Jones, Sasha (April 3, 2006).

 ****** The Fabulous Counts

b'\'\'\'The Fabulous Counts\'\'\' were an American [[soul music|soul]]/[[funk]] group from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. They won local acclaim as an instrumental group and as a backing ensemble for visiting solo acts after their formation in 1968. Working with producer [[Richard "Popcorn" Wylie]], they released the instrumental single "Jan, Jan" on Detroit\'s [[Moira Records]] that year, which narrowly missed hitting the US R&B charts that winter.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p17399/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Fabulous Counts], Allmusic.com</ref> Their second single, "Dirty Red", passed without trace, but the third single, "Get Down People", hit #32 R&B and #88 on the US pop charts.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p17399/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com</ref> A full-length, \'\'Jan, Jan\'\' (produced by [[Ollie McLaughlin]]), was released in 1969 on [[Cotillion Records]], but the group left the label in 1970.

Signing with [[Westbound Records]] that year, the group changed their name simply to \'\'\'The Counts\'\'\'. Shortchanged by Westbound Records in favor of [[The Ohio Players]] and [[Funkadelic]], many of the band\'s original members of the group left, and the band moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], signing with [[Aware Records]], where they released their final LP\'s "Love Sign" and "Funk Pump" before the group called it quits in 1976. All three of the funk albums they released under their new name charted. <ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p16669/biography|pure_url=yes}} The Counts], Allmusic.com</ref>
Just before reuniting in 2009, Mose Davis played jazz piano around Atlanta with the Mose Davis Trio,  Leroy Emmanuel played in a Canadian funk band called the LMT Connection and Demo Cates operated out of Canada as well as appeared as an actor in TV and movies.
In 2009, they reunited back in the line up from 1976: Mose Davis (hammond organ,vocals), Leroy Emmanuel (guitar, vocals), Demo Cates (saxes,vocals), Jimmy "Junebug" Jackson (drums,vocals) and Jimmy Brown (saxes,voc).

The band\'s Cotillion LP has been reissued, and the first Westbound LP is also in print as a CD.

}}

\'\'\'Fattburger\'\'\' is a jazz group, best categorized in the [[jazz-funk]], contemporary jazz, or [[jazz fusion]] subgenres.  The band was formed by saxophonist Hollis Gentry, keyboardist Carl Evans Jr., bassist Mark Hunter, drummer Kevin Koch, and guitarist [[Steve Laury]] in San Diego during the early 1980s.<ref name="Answers">{{cite web|author=Scott Yanow|title=Fattburger Biography at Answers.com|year=2009|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/fattburger}}</ref> Tommy Aros soon joined as a percussionist.

After their first album, Hollis Gentry left the band to launch his solo career (but came back as a part-time member in the 1990s) and after the release of \'\'Come & Get It\'\', Steve Laury also left to embark on a solo career.  As a result, their next album, "On A Roll," was the first recording of Fattburger as a four-piece band (although Kiko Cibrian and Mark Shapiro (Evan Marks pseudonym)<ref>http://shapmarkmusic.com/Bio.html</ref> appeared as studio guitarists). Evan Marks joined the band as a permanent member in 1995.  After their latest album, \'\'Work to Do\'\' (2004), Hollis Gentry died on 5 September 2006 <ref name="San Diego">{{cite web|author=Bart Mendoza|title=Hollis Gentry|year=2006|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/hollis-gentry/}}</ref> and Carl Evans Jr. died on 10 April 2008.<ref name="The San Diego Union Tribune">{{cite web|author=Blanca Gonzalez|title=Carl Evans Jr., 53; musician was part of noted jazz band|year=2008|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080418/news_1m18evans.html/}}</ref>

Later, Fattburger regrouped to play live at the Anthology jazz club on 26 June 2009, featuring [[Allan Phillips]] as a new keyboardist.<ref name="Smooth Jazz Network ">{{cite web|author=Smooth Jazz Network |title=Fattburger Regroups|year=2009|url=http://news.smoothjazznetwork.com/?p=1132}}</ref> Today the band is still touring.

Fattburger\'s most commercially successful CDs were \'\'Sizzlin\'\'\' and \'\'T.G.I.F.attburger!\'\', although the best representations of their contemporary jazz-funk style may have been five earlier albums:  \'\'On a Roll,\'\' \'\'Good News,\'\' \'\'Living in Paradise,\'\' \'\'Come and Get It,\'\' and \'\'Time Will Tell.\'\'

\'\'\'Galactic\'\'\' is a [[jam band]] from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], United States.

==Origins and background==
Originally formed in 1994 as an octet (under the name Galactic Prophylactic) and including singer Chris Lane and guitarist Rob Gowen, the group was soon pared down to a sextet of: guitarist Jeff Raines, bassist [[Robert Mercurio]], drummer [[Stanton Moore]], Hammond organist Rich Vogel, [[Theryl DeClouet]] on vocals, and later adding saxophonist Ben Ellman.

The group was started when Raines and Mercurio, childhood friends from affluent [[Chevy Chase, Maryland]], moved to [[New Orleans]] together to attend college at [[Tulane]] and [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola]] Universities, became enamored of the local funk scene, populated by such legendary acts as [[The Meters]] and [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]] and inspired by local legends such as [[Professor Longhair]]. There they teamed with noted New Orleans drummer [[Stanton Moore]], saxophonist/harmonica (now producer) Ben Ellman, and Rich Vogel. In 2004, the band parted ways with vocalist DeClouet, and now continue as an instrumental group.  They have been releasing albums consistently since 1996.

==Musical style==
The band has developed a unique sound as a result of their influences, including: [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[world music]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]].  Many of their songs include performances by other artists of various styles of music, like hip-hop artists [[Boots Riley]] (of [[The Coup]]), [[Gift of Gab (rapper)|Gift of Gab]] (of [[Blackalicious]]) and [[Chali 2na]] (of [[Jurassic 5]]). On the European version of [[From the Corner to the Block]] there are two tracks more than on the US version. One of those tracks ("Valley Of Pain") features the German rapper [[Dendemann]].

==Evolution==
Over the years, the band\'s sound has evolved from organic New Orleans funk to a more modern style, incorporating elements of hip hop, electronica, fusion, and jazz.  This change has been largely characterized by the increased use of electronic effects on guitar, bass, saxophone, and drums. Drummer [[Stanton Moore]] uses phrase samplers to sample a rhythm which he can then play over, producing intricate and layered drum sounds. Ben Ellman, saxophonist and harmonica player, often distorts his instruments to the degree that they sound similar to an electric guitar.

==Live performances==
The band is also noted for inviting guest musicians from New Orleans to perform onstage with them. These include:  the [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]], [[The Neville Brothers]], [[Brian Seeger]], [[Corey "Boe Money" Henry]] [[George Porter]] of [[The Meters]], [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]] and [[Skerik]] (a saxophone player who is actually based in [[Seattle, Washington]], but is part of Stanton Moore\'s side project [[Garage A Trois]]), to name a few. 
The band is often on tour, and have shared the stage with acts including [[Live (band)|Live]], [[Counting Crows]], the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[The Roots]], [[Fusebox Funk]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[B.B. King]], [[Mike Doughty]] (formerly of [[Soul Coughing]]), [[Gift of Gab (rapper)|Gift of Gab]] (of [[Blackalicious]]), and [[Jurassic 5]].

In 2009, the band did a show with [[Brian Seeger]] in Kentucky at the Oulipo Ballroom.

As of 2010, the band\'s main guest vocalist has been [[Corey Glover]] from the band [[Living Colour]].

Galactic toured North America in 2012 with [[Corey Glover]] and [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]].  On March 29, 2012 Galactic appeared with [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]] and [[Corey Glover]] on the [[Conan O\'Brien]] show on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] .<ref name="The Social.com">{{cite web|title=Soul Rebels on Conan|url=http://www.thesocial.org/2012/03/27/soul-rebels-on-conan-this-thurs-329/|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

==Recent releases==
\'\'Ya-Ka-May\'\' was released on Feb 9, 2010 on [[ANTI-]]. The album includes guest performances by a range of New Orleans musicians. Long-established performers such as [[Rebirth Brass Band]], [[Irma Thomas]], Big Chief Bo Dollis of [[The Wild Magnolias]], [[Allen Toussaint]] and [[Walter "Wolfman" Washington]] are represented, along with younger performers in the traditional vein, such as [[Trombone Shorty]] and Corey Henry, [[John Boutt\xc3\xa9]], Josh Cohen and Ryan Scully of [[Morning 40 Federation]], and Glen David Andrews, and also [[Bounce music|Bounce]] artists Cheeky Blakk, Big Freedia, Katey Red, and Sissy Nobby.<ref>{{Citation

\'\'\'The Gap Band\'\'\' was an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]] which rose to fame during the 1970s and 1980s. Composed of brothers [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie]], Ronnie, and Robert Wilson, the band first formed as the \'\'\'Greenwood, Archer and Pine Street Band\'\'\' in 1967, in their hometown of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The group shortened its name to \'\'The Gap Band\'\' in 1973. After 43 years together, they retired in 2010.

==History==

===Early years===
After having grown up with a [[Pentecostal]] [[Minister of religion|minister]] father, Ronnie Wilson formed the Greenwood, Archer, and Pine Street Band in 1967, named after the most prosperous black communities of all time - Black Wallstreet, which was bombed during a race riot in 1921, with [[Tuck Andress]] (later of [[Tuck and Patti]]), Roscoe "Toast" Smith, and Chris Clayton. In 1972, Ronnie\'s younger brother Charlie joined the band, and in 1973, their younger brother Robert became the band\'s bassist. Eventually, the band would be condensed to a trio composed of Ronnie, Robert, and Charlie Wilson.

Early on, the group took on a [[Funk music|funk]] sound reminiscent of the early 70s.<ref>\'\'The Gap Band\'\' (1977) at [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r173490|pure_url=yes}} allmusic]</ref> This style failed to catch on, and their first two LP\'s, 1974\'s \'\'Magician\'s Holiday\'\' and 1977\'s \'\'The Gap Band\'\' (not to be confused with their 1979 album) failed to chart or produce any charting singles. However, they were introduced to [[Los Angeles|LA]] producer [[Lonnie Simmons]], who signed them to his production company Total Experience Productions (named after his successful Crenshaw Boulevard nightclub), and managed to get them a label deal with Mercury Records.

===Success===
When Lonnie signed them, the group had twelve musicians. The group dropped most of their personnel. Raymond Calhoun (writer of "Outstanding"), Oliver Scott (co-writer of "Yearning For Your Love"), and arranger/producer Malvin Dino Vice (co-writer of "Boys Are Back in Town") were retained as members of the backing band and contributed substantially to the Gap Band\'s later recordings. On their first Simmons-produced album, \'\'The Gap Band\'\', they found chart success with songs such as "I\'m in Love" and "Shake"; the latter became a Top 10 R&B hit in 1979.

Later that year, the group released "[[Oops Upside Your Head|I Don\'t Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Oops!)]]" on their album \'\'[[The Gap Band II]]\'\'. Although it did not hit the Hot 100, it soared to #4 R&B, and the album went [[RIAA certification|gold]]. The song, and the band\'s musical output as a whole, became more [[P-funk#Musical characteristics|P-Funk]]-esque,<ref>\'\'The Gap Band II\'\' on [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r38650|pure_url=yes}} allmusic]</ref> with expanded use of the synthesizers and spoken monologues within songs (see audio sample). The song "Steppin\' (Out)" also reached the top 10 R&B.<ref name="RIAA">RIAA Certifications at [http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Gap%20Band&format=Album&go=Search&perPage=25 RIAA.com]</ref>

Charlie and Ronnie provided background vocals on [[Stevie Wonder]]\'s 1980 hit "I Ain\'t Gonna Stand For It" from Wonder\'s album \'\'Hotter Than July\'\' (1980).

The band reached a whole new level of fame in 1980 with the release of the #1 R&B and #16 Billboard 200 hit, \'\'[[The Gap Band III]]\'\'. The band adopted a formula of quiet storm ballads (such as the #5 R&B song "[[Yearning for Your Love]]" and "Are You Living") supported by anthemic funk songs (such as the R&B chart-topper "[[Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)]]" and "[[Humpin\']]"). They repeated this formula on the #1 R&B album \'\'[[Gap Band IV]]\'\' in 1982 (the first album released on Simmons\' newly launched Total Experience Records), which resulted in three hit singles: "[[Early in the Morning (The Gap Band song)|Early in the Morning]]" (#1 R&B, #13 Dance, #24 Hot 100), "[[You Dropped a Bomb on Me]]" (#2 R&B, #31 Hot 100, #39 Dance), and "[[Outstanding]]" (#1 R&B, #24 Dance). It was during this time that former [[Brides of Funkenstein]] singer [[Dawn Silva]] joined them on tour.<ref>Dawn Silva [http://www.answers.com/topic/dawn-silva Biography]</ref>

Their 1983 effort, \'\'[[Gap Band V: Jammin\']]\'\', went gold, but was not quite as successful as the previous works, peaking at #2 R&B and #28 on the Billboard 200. The single "[[Party Train]]" peaked at #3 R&B, and the song "Jam the Motha\'" peaked at #16 R&B, but neither made it onto the Hot 100. The album\'s closer "Someday" (a loose cover of [[Donny Hathaway]]\'s "[[Someday We\'ll All Be Free]]") featured [[Stevie Wonder]] as a guest vocalist.<ref>Gap Band V: Jammin\' at [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r8002|pure_url=yes}} allmusic]</ref>

Their next work, \'\'[[Gap Band VI]]\'\' brought them back to #1 R&B in 1985, but the album sold fewer copies and did not go gold. "Beep a Freak" hit #2 R&B, "I Found My Baby" peaked at #8 on the R&B charts, and "Disrespect" peaked at #18. That year, lead singer Charlie Wilson provided backing vocals on [[Zapp & Roger]]\'s #2 R&B "[[Computer Love (Zapp & Roger song)|Computer Love]]".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Later years===
While their 1986 cover of "[[Going in Circles (song)|Going in Circles]]" went to #2 on the R&B charts, and the album it was released on, \'\'[[Gap Band VII]]\'\', hit #6 R&B, the album almost became their first in years to miss the Billboard 200, peaking at a mere #159.

While they were beginning to struggle stateside, the group found their greatest success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] when their 1987 single "Big Fun" from \'\'[[Gap Band 8]]\'\' reached #4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>[http://archive.is/20120730172546/http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=3333 Chart Stats]</ref> 1988\'s \'\'Straight from the Heart\'\' was their last studio album with Total Experience.

The Gap Band caught a small break in 1988 with the [[Keenan Ivory Wayans]] film \'\'[[I\'m Gonna Git You Sucka]]\'\'. They contributed the non-charting "You\'re So Cute" and the #14 R&B title track to the film (The first was not on the soundtrack, but was used in the film).<ref>Soundtrack Listing at [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095348/soundtrack IMDB]</ref> Their first song on their new label, Capitol Records, 1989\'s "[[All of My Love (The Gap Band song)|All of My Love]]" (from their album \'\'Round Trip\'\'), is, to date, their last #1 R&B hit. The album also produced the #8 R&B "Addicted to Your Love" and the #18 R&B ""We Can Make it Alright."  They left [[Capitol Records]] the next year and went on a five year hiatus from producing new material.

During the 1990s, the band released three non-charting studio albums and two [[live album]]s. The only album to chart was the live album \'\'[[Live & Well (Gap Band album)|Live & Well]]\'\', which peaked at #54 R&B in 1996.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Legacy==
In 1992, [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie]] ventured into a solo career and has had several moderate R&B hits on his own. Wilson\'s vocals were credited in part for inspiring the vocal style of [[New Jack Swing]] artists [[Guy (music group)|Guy]], [[Aaron Hall (singer)|Aaron Hall]], [[Keith Sweat]], and [[R. Kelly]]. The band reunited in 1996, and issued \'\'The Gap Band: Live and Well\'\', a live [[greatest hits]] album.

On August 26, 2005, The Gap Band was honored as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the 57th annual BMI Urban Awards.  The honor is given to a creator who has been "a unique and indelible influence on generations of music makers."Outstanding" alone remains one of the most sampled songs in history and has, astonishingly, been used by over 150 artists.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234529 |title=Lil Jon, R. Kelly, Kanye West and EMI Take Top Honors at BMI Urban Awards|publisher=bmi.com|accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

Robert Wilson died of a heart attack at his home in [[Palmdale, California]] on August 15, 2010.<ref>Jennifer Chancellor, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/article.aspx?subjectid=269&articleid=20100815_371_0_TheGod700222 "Robert Wilson of the Gap Band, \'Godfather of bass guitar,\' dead at 53"], \'\'[[Tulsa World]]\'\', August 16, 2010.</ref>

\'\'\'Larry Graham, Jr.\'\'\' (born August 14, 1946) is an American [[bass guitar]] player, both with the popular and influential [[psychedelic soul]]/[[funk]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]], and as the founder and frontman of [[Graham Central Station]]. He is credited with the invention of the [[Slapping (music)|slapping]] technique, which radically expanded the tonal palette of the bass, although he himself refers to the technique as "thumpin\xe2\x80\xb2 and pluckin\xe2\x80\xb2".<ref name="bassplayermagazine">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071013112317/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/larry-graham-trunk/apr-07/26994 "Larry Graham: Trunk of the Funk Tree"], \'\'[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]]\'\' magazine, April 2007.</ref>

==Biography==
Born in [[Beaumont, Texas]], to successful musicians, Graham played bass in the highly successful and influential [[funk]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]] from 1966 to 1972. It is said that he pioneered the art of slap-pop playing on the electric bass, in part to provide percussive and rhythmic elements in addition to the notes of the bass line when his mother\'s band lacked a drummer; the slap of the thumb being used to emulate a [[bass drum]] and the pop of the index or middle finger as a [[snare drum]].<ref name="bassplayermagazine" /> This style has become archetypal of modern funk. Slap-pop playing couples a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The slap and pop technique incorporates a large ratio of muted or "dead" notes to normal notes, which adds to the rhythmic effect.

This "slap" bass style was later used by such artists as [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Louis Johnson (bassist)|Louis Johnson]], [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Victor Wooten]], [[Jonas Hellborg]], Kim Clarke of [[Defunkt]], [[Marcus Miller]], [[Stanley Clarke]], and [[John Norwood Fisher]] of Fishbone.

After Sly and the Family Stone, Graham formed his own band, [[Graham Central Station]]. The name is a pun on [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], the train station located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Graham Central Station had several hits in the 1970s, including "Hair".

In the mid-1970s, Larry Graham worked with [[Betty Davis]], the second ex-wife of jazz legend [[Miles Davis]]. Betty Davis\' band included members of the [[Tower of Power]] horns and the [[Pointer Sisters]], and she recorded three albums to critical acclaim but limited commercial success.

In 1975, Graham became one of [[Jehovah\'s Witnesses]].<ref>\'\'[[Awake!]]\'\' magazine, February 22, 1989, p. 15.</ref> Eventually, he was credited with introducing [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] to the faith. In the early 1980s, Graham recorded five solo albums and had several solo hits on the R&B charts.  His biggest hit was "[[One in a Million You]]", a crossover hit, which reached No. 9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart in 1980.

He reformed Graham Central Station in the early 1990s and performed with the band for several years during which they released two live albums. One was recorded in [[Japan]] in 1992, and the other, recorded in [[London]] in 1996, had only 1000 copies printed and was exclusively sold at concerts.

In 1998, he recorded a solo album under the name Graham Central Station, \'\'[[GCS 2000]]\'\'. It was a collaboration between Larry Graham and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. While Graham wrote all the songs, except one co-written by Prince, the album was co-arranged and co-produced by Prince, and most of the instruments and vocals were recorded by both Graham and Prince. Graham also played bass on tours with Prince in 1997\xe2\x80\x932000. He appeared in Prince\'s 1998 VHS \'\'[[Beautiful Strange]]\'\' and 1999 DVD \'\'[[Rave Un2 the Year 2000]]\'\'.

He has appeared with Prince since then at various international venues.

Larry Graham and Graham Central Station performed internationally with a world tour in 2010 and the "Funk Around The World" international tour in 2011. He appeared as a special guest at Jim James\' "Rock N\' Soul Dance Party Superjam" at Bonnaroo 2013.

Graham is the father of [[singer/songwriter]] and producer Darric Graham and is the uncle of [[Canadian people|Canadian]] rapper and actor [[Drake (entertainer)|Aubrey Graham]] (Drake).

\'\'\'Graham Central Station\'\'\' was an American [[funk music|funk]] band named after founder [[Larry Graham]] (formerly of [[Sly & the Family Stone]]). The name is a pun on [[New York City]]\'s [[Grand Central Terminal]], often colloquially called Grand Central Station.

The band\'s origins date from when [[Santana (band)|Santana]] [[guitarist]] [[Neal Schon]] formed the band [[Azteca (band)|Azteca]] along with Larry Graham ([[bass guitar]]) and [[Gregg Errico]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]), both from Sly & the Family Stone, and [[Pete Sears]] ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), from [[Hot Tuna]] and [[Jefferson Starship]]. Santana bass guitar player Tom Rutley would move into the bass spot with Azteca. That band, like Santana with heavy Latin influences, would eventually morph into Graham Central Station, while Schon would form [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. The invention of electric [[slap bass]] is attributed by many (including [[Victor Wooten]] and [[Bootsy Collins]]) to Graham, which influenced many musical genres, such as [[funk]], [[R&B]] and [[disco]]. 

Graham Central Station\'s biggest hit was "Your Love", which charted at number 9 in 1975.  The group also integrated [[gospel music]] into their repertoire, and played with the dichotomy between the funk/rock star image and the "sanctified" gospel group image.  Some of their recordings feature the [[Tower of Power]] horn section.

In 2011, Graham Central Station opened for [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] on Prince\'s "Welcome 2 America" tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review:  Prince\'s Welcome 2 America Tour|url=http://www.culturebrats.com/2011/02/review-princes-welcome-2-america-tour.html|publisher=Culture Brats|accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref>

\'\'\'Grant Green\'\'\' (June 6, 1935 \xe2\x80\x93 January 31, 1979)<ref>Sharony Andrews Green, \'\'Grant Green: Rediscovering the Forgotten Genius of Jazz Guitar,\'\' Backbeat Books, 1999, p. 8.</ref> was an American [[jazz]] guitarist and composer.

Recording prolifically and mainly for [[Blue Note Records]] (as both leader and sideman) Green performed in the [[hard bop]], [[soul jazz]], [[bebop]] and [[latin jazz|Latin]]-tinged idioms throughout his career. Critics [[Michael Erlewine]] and [[Ron Wynn]] write, "A severely underrated player during his lifetime, Grant Green is one of the great unsung heroes of jazz guitar ... Green\'s playing is immediately recognizable \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps more than any other guitarist."<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p6619|pure_url=yes}} Erlewine, Michael and Ron Wynn, "Grant Green" from Allmusic.com] URL accessed January 26, 2007</ref> Critic Dave Hunter described his sound as "lithe, loose, slightly bluesy and righteously groovy".<ref>[http://www.gibsonguitar.es/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/Get-That-Tone_-Green-Street-er.aspx Dave Hunter, "Get That Tone: Green Street-era Grant Green"], Gibson, Jul 4, 2008.</ref> He often performed in an [[organ trio]], a small group with an organ and drummer.

Apart from guitarist [[Charlie Christian]], Green\'s primary influences were saxophonists, particularly [[Charlie Parker]], and his approach was therefore almost exclusively linear rather than chordal. The simplicity and immediacy of Green\'s playing, which tended to avoid chromaticism, derived from his early work playing [[rhythm and blues]] and, although at his best he achieved a synthesis of this style with bop, he was essentially a blues guitarist and returned almost exclusively to this style in his later career.<ref>Andrew Waggoner, \'\'New Grove Dictionary of Jazz\'\'. ISBN 0-333-63231-1</ref>

==Biography==
Green was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri. He first performed in a professional setting at the age of 12. His influences were [[Charlie Christian]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Lester Young]], and [[Jimmy Raney]], he first played [[Boogie-woogie (music)|boogie-woogie]] before moving on to [[jazz]]. His first recordings in St. Louis were with tenor saxophonist [[Jimmy Forrest]] for the United label. The drummer in the band was [[Elvin Jones]], later the powerhouse behind [[John Coltrane]]. Grant recorded with Elvin again in the early 1960s. [[Lou Donaldson]] discovered Grant playing in a bar in St. Louis. After touring together with Donaldson, Grant arrived in New York around 1959\xe2\x80\x9360.

Lou Donaldson introduced Grant to [[Alfred Lion]] of [[Blue Note Records]]. Lion was so impressed with Grant that rather than testing Grant as a sideman, as was the usual Blue Note practice, Lion arranged for him to record as a group leader first. However, due to a lack of confidence on Green\'s part the initial recording session was only released in 2001 as \'\'[[First Session]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.audio-ideas.com/columns/grant-green.html "Grant Green \xe2\x80\x93 An Introduction"], Audio Ideas Guide.</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r518812|pure_url=yes}} Review by Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr], Allmusic.com</ref>

Despite the shelving of his first session, Green\'s recording relationship with Blue Note was to last, with a few exceptions, throughout the Sixties. From 1961 to 1965, Grant made more appearances on Blue Note [[Gramophone record|LPs]], as leader or sideman, than anyone else. Grant\'s first issued album as a leader was \'\'[[Grant\'s First Stand]]\'\'. This was followed in the same year by \'\'Green Street\'\' and \'\'[[Grantstand]]\'\'. Grant was named best new star in the \'\'[[Down Beat]]\'\' critics\' poll, in 1962. He often provided support to the other important musicians on Blue Note, including saxophonists [[Hank Mobley]], [[Ike Quebec]], [[Stanley Turrentine]] and organist [[Larry Young (jazz)|Larry Young]].

\'\'Sunday Mornin\' \'\', \'\'The Latin Bit\'\' and \'\'Feelin\' the Spirit\'\' are all loose [[concept album]]s, each taking a musical theme or style: [[Gospel music|Gospel]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s respectively. Grant always carried off his more commercial dates with artistic success during this period. \'\'[[Idle Moments]]\'\' (1963), featuring [[Joe Henderson]] and [[Bobby Hutcherson]], and \'\'Solid\'\' (1964), are thought of as two of Grant\'s best recordings.

Many of Grant\'s recordings were not released during his lifetime. These include [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Elvin Jones]] (also part of the \'\'Solid\'\' group) performing on \'\'[[Matador (Grant Green album)|Matador]]\'\'  (also recorded in 1964), and several albums with pianist [[Sonny Clark]]. In 1966 Grant left Blue Note and recorded for several other labels, including [[Verve Records|Verve]]. From 1967 to 1969 Grant was, for the most part, inactive due to personal problems and the effects of [[drug addiction|heroin addiction]].  In 1969 Grant returned with a new [[funk]]-influenced band. His recordings from this period include the commercially successful \'\'Green is Beautiful\'\' and the soundtrack to the film \'\'[[The Final Comedown]]\'\'.

Grant left Blue Note again in 1974 and the subsequent recordings he made with other labels divide opinion: some consider Green to have been the \'Father of [[Acid Jazz]]\' (and his late recordings have been sampled by artists including [[US3]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sampled/Grant%20Green/ |title=Grant Green Music Sampled by Others |publisher=WhoSampled |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}</ref> while others have dismissed them (reissue producer [[Michael Cuscuna]] wrote in the sleeve notes for the album \'\'Matador\'\': "During the 1970s [Green] made some pretty lame records").

Grant spent much of 1978 in hospital and, against the advice of doctors, went back on the road to earn some money. While in New York to play an engagement at [[George Benson]]\'s Breezin\' Lounge, Grant collapsed in his car of a heart attack in New York City on January 31, 1979.  He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri, and was survived by six children. Since Green\'s demise, his reputation has grown and many compilations of both his earlier (post-bop/straight ahead and soul jazz) and later (funkier/dancefloor jazz) periods, exist.

==Equipment==
Green used a [[Gibson ES-330]], then a Gibson L7 with a Gibson McCarty pickguard/pick-up, an [[Epiphone]] Emperor (with the same pick-up) and finally had a custom-built [[D\'Aquisto]].  According to fellow guitarist [[George Benson]], Grant achieved his tone by turning off the bass and treble settings of his amplifier, and maximizing the midrange. This way he could get his signature punchy, biting tone.

'''The Greyboy Allstars''' are a [[jazz band]] who released their fourth album, Inland Emperor, in 2013.

The band came together in 1994, when the individual members were asked to perform at a record release party for the landmark [[acid jazz]] and club staple \xe2\x80\x9cFreestylin\xe2\x80\x9d by [[San Diego|San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s]] [[DJ Greyboy]], who was famous for spinning `70s soul and funk. They enjoyed playing together that they decided to continue on as a band. The Greyboy Allstars starting playing weekly at San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s now defunct [[Green Circle]], weekends at [[San Francisco|San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s]] [[Elbo Room]] and various clubs throughout Europe. By playing danceable [[boogaloo]] music within the soul jazz genre, they became a national and international phenomenon. 
\t
The lineup of the band remains nearly the same, with [[Karl Denson]] on horns and vocals, [[Robert Walter (musician)|Robert Walter]] on keyboards, [[Elgin Park]] (aka [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]]) on guitars and vocals, and [[Chris Stillwell]] on bass. Original drummer [[Zak Najor]] was replaced by [[Aaron Redfield]], an old friend of the band and frequent collaborator. While DJ Greyboy is no longer a member of the band, he remains a central figure in their artistic output, having introduced the band to many of the records that inspire their sound, produced their first album and appeared on 2007\xe2\x80\xb2s What Happened to Television?

Individual members of the group have gone to score film and television shows, work with platinum artists and bands both on the road and in the studio, and head their own solo projects. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For Inland Emperor, they worked out the arrangements during the recording, which took place live over just a few sessions at Elgin Park\xe2\x80\x99s studio in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], CA. Denson says of this accelerated pace of creation, \xe2\x80\x9cWe do in one week would take me two months to do in any other situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grammy Award-winning producer/engineer [[Mickey Petralia]] (Beck, Peaches, Eels, Flight of the Conchords) mixed the tracks.

\'\'\'Edward Earl "Eddie" Hazel\'\'\' (April 10, 1950 \xe2\x80\x93 December 23, 1992) was an American guitarist in early [[funk]] music in the [[United States]] who played lead guitar with [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]. Hazel was a posthumous inductee of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1950, Hazel grew up in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] because his mother, Grace Cook, wanted her son to grow up in an environment without the pressures of [[drugs]] and [[crime]] that she felt pervaded [[New York City]].  Hazel occupied himself from a young age by playing a [[guitar]], given to him as a [[Christmas]] present by his older brother. Hazel also [[singing|sang]] in church.  At age 12, Hazel met [[Billy "Bass" Nelson]], and the pair quickly became close friends and began performing, soon adding drummer Harvey McGee to the mix.

===Career===
In 1967, [[The Parliaments]], a Plainfield-based [[doo wop]] band headed by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], had a hit record with "(I Wanna) Testify."  Clinton recruited a backing band for a tour, hiring Nelson as bassist, who in turn recommended Hazel as guitarist. Hazel was in [[Newark, New Jersey]], working with George Blackwell and could not be reached. After Nelson returned from the tour, he tried to recruit Hazel. His mother at first vetoed the idea, since Hazel was only seventeen, but Clinton and Nelson worked together to change her mind.

In late 1967, The Parliaments went on tour with both Nelson and Hazel. In [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] Hazel met and befriended [[Tiki Fulwood]], who quickly replaced The Parliaments\' drummer. Nelson, Hazel and Fulwood became the backbone of [[Funkadelic]], which was originally the backup band for The Parliaments, only to later become an independent touring group when legal difficulties forced Clinton to temporarily abandon the name "Parliaments".

The switch to Funkadelic was complete with the addition of [[Tawl Ross]] and [[Bernie Worrell]] ([[rhythm guitar]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], respectively). \'\'[[Funkadelic (album)|Funkadelic]]\'\' (1970), \'\'[[Free Your Mind... And Your Ass Will Follow]]\'\' (1970) and \'\'[[Maggot Brain]]\'\' (1971) were the first three albums, released within two years. All three albums prominently featured Hazel\'s guitar work.

The third album\'s title song, "[[Maggot Brain (song)|Maggot Brain]]", consists of a ten-minute [[guitar solo]] by Hazel. Clinton reportedly told Hazel during the recording session to imagine he had been told his mother was dead, but then learned that it was not true.<ref name=Tate/> Music critic [[Greg Tate]] described it as Funkadelic\'s \'\'[[A Love Supreme]]\'\'.<ref name=Tate>{{cite news |last=Tate |first=Greg |authorlink=Greg Tate |title=Eddie Hazel, 1950\xe2\x80\x931992 |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=January 12, 1993 }}</ref> In 2008, Rolling Stone cited this as number 60 on its list of 100 greatest "guitar songs" of all time.<ref>{{cite web |title=100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time |work=Rolling Stone  |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/26 |accessdate=2008-06-07 }}</ref>

Nelson and Hazel officially quit [[Funkadelic]] in late 1971 over financial disputes with Clinton, though Hazel contributed to the group sporadically over the next several years. The albums \'\'[[America Eats Its Young]]\'\' (1972) and \'\'[[Cosmic Slop]]\'\' (1973) featured only marginal input from Hazel. Instead, Hazel began working with [[The Temptations]] (along with Nelson), appearing on \'\'[[1990 (The Temptations album)|1990]]\'\' (1973) and \'\'[[A Song for You (Temptations album)|A Song for You]]\'\' (1975).

For the 1974 [[Funkadelic]] album \'\'[[Standing on the Verge of Getting It On]]\'\', Hazel co-wrote all of the album\'s songs. On six of those songs the songwriting credit was in the name of Grace Cook, Hazel\'s mother.<ref name=Tate/> Hazel also had a significant presence as arranger and lead guitarist on the same year\'s Parliament album, \'\'[[Up For The Down Stroke]]\'\'.  In 1974, Hazel was indicted for assaulting an airline stewardess and an air marshal,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=zBwFHNeUF3UC&pg=PA236&dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=4#v=onepage&q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&f=false Funk: the music, the people, and the rhythm of the one] By Rickey Vincent p. 273.</ref> along with a drug possession charge. While Hazel was in jail, Clinton recruited [[Michael Hampton]] as the new lead guitarist for [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].<ref name=Tate/>

In the next several years, Hazel appeared occasionally on [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] albums, although his guitar work was rarely featured. One song that featured Hazel\'s lead guitar is "Comin\' Round the Mountain" on \'\'[[Hardcore Jollies]]\'\' (1976). In 1977, Hazel recorded a "solo" album, \'\'[[Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs]]\'\', with support from other members of Parliament-Funkadelic, including vocals from [[The Brides of Funkenstein]].<ref name=Tate/> He was completely absent from \'\'[[One Nation Under a Groove]]\'\' (1978), Funkadelic\'s most commercially successful album. Hazel made another prominent appearance in "Man\'s Best Friend" on the George Clinton album \'\'[[Computer Games (album)|Computer Games]]\'\' (1982),<ref name=Tate/> as well as the track "Pumping It Up" from the [[P-Funk All Stars]] album \'\'[[Urban Dancefloor Guerillas]]\'\'.

On December 23, 1992, Hazel died from internal bleeding and liver failure.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PA295&dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&f=false The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches] By Jeremy Simmonds</ref> "Maggot Brain" was played at his funeral.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=RIEjkWXZdrMC&pg=PA139&dq=%22Eddie+Hazel%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Eddie%20Hazel%22%20dead%20OR%20death%20OR%20died&f=false Funk] By Dave Thompson p. 141</ref>

===Legacy===
Three collections of unreleased recordings have been released posthumously: The 1994 four-song [[Extended play|EP]] \'\'[[Jams From the Heart]]\'\' (which [[Rhino Records]] later added as bonus material to its rerelease of \'\'Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs\'\'), 1994\'s \'\'[[Rest in P]]\'\' and 2006\'s \'\'[[Eddie Hazel At Home]]\'\'.

Other recordings by Hazel have appeared on albums by other musicians. Several albums produced by [[Bill Laswell]], including \'\'[[Funkcronomicon]]\'\' (released under the name [[Axiom Funk]], 1995) have featured Hazel\'s guitar. [[Bootsy Collins]] has also incorporated recordings of Hazel in some of his recent releases, for example, "Good Night Eddie" on \'\'[[Blasters of the Universe]]\'\'. The band [[Ween]] recorded a tribute to him called "A Tear for Eddie" on their album \'\'[[Chocolate And Cheese]]\'\'.  There is an image of Hazel on the back of [[Primal Scream]]\'s album \'\'[[Give Out But Don\'t Give Up]]\'\'.

Hazel has been featured on a number of lists of greatest guitarists of all time. He was 43 on the list of Rolling Stone magazine\'s 100 Greatest Guitarists Of All Time <ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/5945/32609/33018 100 Greatest Guitarists] Rolling Stone</ref> and was ranked at 88 in a similar list by [[Uncut Magazine]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

\'\'\'The Headhunters\'\'\' are an American [[jazz-funk]] [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] band, best known for their albums they recorded as a backing band of [[jazz]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player [[Herbie Hancock]] during the 1970s. Hancock\'s debut album with the group, \'\'[[Head Hunters (album)|Head Hunters]]\'\', is one of the best-selling jazz/fusion records of all time.

==History==
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Head Hunters Album.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Headhunters pictured on the cover of their eponymous debut LP.]] -->

Hancock originally assembled the band for his 1973 album \'\'Head Hunters\'\'. The Headhunters\' new lineup and instrumentation, retaining only [[Wind instrument|wind]] player [[Bennie Maupin]] from Hancock\'s previous sextet, reflected his new musical direction. [[Bassist]] [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|Paul Jackson]] was the only other member who maintained a continuous presence in the lineup in subsequent recordings and concerts. On the original \'\'Head Hunters\'\' album the other band members were [[percussionist]] [[Bill Summers (musician)|Bill Summers]] and drummer [[Harvey Mason]]. For the next Hancock album featuring Headhunters, 1974\'s \'\'[[Thrust (album)|Thrust]]\'\', [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]] took over as drummer. 

Both Mason and Clark contributed drums to Hancock\'s 1975\'s album \'\'[[Man-Child]]\'\', which featured 18 musicians.

1975 also saw Headhunters first album without Hancock, \'\'[[Survival of the Fittest (The Headhunters album)|Survival of the Fittest]]\'\', featuring the hit "God Make Me Funky". This song was [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[the Fugees]], among many others, for their track "Ready or Not", and has been covered by [[Jamiroquai]] as a live track. While Hancock\'s \'\'Man-Child\'\' moved a bit towards more commercial sounds, \'\'Survival of the Fittest\'\' kept Headhunters focused to intense jazz-funk. Vocals were heard on two songs but there was still lots of experimental fusion on the album (the band\'s music is called "space-funk" on some re-issues of the album).

As the 1970s turned to the 1980s, Hancock drifted away from the band as he moved into his [[electro (music)|electro]]-oriented phase, and they ceased operation as a visible unit. The band reunited with Hancock for the 1998 album \'\'[[Return of the Headhunters]]\'\'.  

Clark, Jackson and Summers have since continued recording and performing as the Headhunters, with varied incarnations, such as [[Victor Atkins]] or [[Robert Walter (musician)|Robert Walter]] filling in for Hancock on keyboards, and utilizing [[Donald Harrison]] as often as possible. They released an album, \'\'Evolution Revolution\'\', for [[Basin Street Records]] in 2003, and backed up the saxophonist Rebecca Barry on her 2005 album \'\'[[Rebecca Barry and the Headhunters]]\'\'. They toured again in 2008, with [[Jerry Z]] on keyboards and bassist [[T.M. Stevens]], and in 2009 played gigs featuring [[Geri Allen]] on keyboards and Harrison on alto, with [[Richie Goods]] playing bass.

In 2010 the Headhunters signed with Indianapolis jazz label [[Owl Studios]]. They released \'\'[[Platinum (The Headhunters album)|Platinum]]\'\', which featured many of the original members of the band with guest spots by [[Snoop Dogg]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], and [[Killah Priest]], among others.

==Musical style and influences==
The Headhunters\' music is a complex blend of many styles and genres, including [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[Music of Africa|African]] and [[Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]] music. The group is also notable for its pioneering use of [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] and effects.

In the sleeve notes to \'\'Head Hunters\'\', Hancock confirmed that track 3, "Sly", was named in tribute to [[Sly Stone]], leader of [[Sly & the Family Stone]]. This band, along with [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], are one of the key influences from funk music. As in funk music, the band often built a groove around a bassline; Paul Jackson\'s deceptively simple licks are frequently the bedrock of Headhunters material, as much as Mike Clark and Harvey Mason\'s drumming ("[[Chameleon (composition)|Chameleon]]", the famous opening track of \'\'Head Hunters\'\', provides a fine example of this, although in this case the main bassline is played by Hancock.) Also taken from funk music is the technique of building a complex groove by combining many small but carefully interlocking [[Syncopation|syncopated]] contributions. 

While straightforward funk depends on a snappy, danceable [[beat (music)|backbeat]] from the drummer, Clark and Jackson\'s interplay danced in and around the groove motif, creating some complex rhythmic patterns. This is arguably best exemplified by the music on \'\'Thrust\'\', particularly on the song "[[Actual Proof]]".

Early editions of the Headhunters were notable for the absence of a [[guitarist]]. All guitar-like parts were handled by Hancock on his first two albums with the group, with one exception: the "rhythm guitar" heard interacting with Hancock\'s synthesizer bass early in the track \'\'Chameleon\'\' is actually Jackson playing in the upper register of the bass guitar, as pointed out by Steven F. Pond in his book \'\'Head Hunters\'\' (2005). [[Electric guitar]]s were first introduced when [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]] appeared on \'\'Survival of the Fittest\'\'.

Although the Headhunters\' albums were often belittled as "[[pop (music)|pop]]" by purist jazz critics at the time, it is now widely accepted that they were significantly influenced by, and made a significant contribution to, the "serious jazz" canon. Their music featured extensive solo and group [[improvisation]] over [[chord progression]]s, just as in the jazz mainstream. Most of the overtly jazz-influenced material comes in the form of solos from Hancock and Bennie Maupin.

A strong connection to African music is evident, with the role of percussion hugely enhanced compared to mainstream jazz, and more extensive exploration of complex polyrhythms compared to most funk.

The Headhunters are also notable for the unusually wide range of instruments they use. Hancock used a myriad of keyboards, from the staple [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano to the Hohner [[clavinet]], as well as being an early adopter of [[synthesizer]]s, particularly instruments from [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]]. Maupin used bass, tenor, alto and soprano [[saxophone]]s, bass [[clarinet]] and bass [[flute]], and oddities such as the [[Saxello]] and [[Lyricon]].  Unusual choices like beer bottles and the Voice Bag also featured in their instrumentation.

==Members==
The following members appeared on multiple Headhunters releases:

* [[Herbie Hancock]]: keyboards, electric pianos, clavinet, synthesizers
* [[Bennie Maupin]]: saxophones, saxello, clarinets, flutes, lyricon
* [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|Paul Jackson]]: bass

 ****** Hi-Tension

b'{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}
\'\'\'Hi-Tension\'\'\' were a British band based in [[North London]], seen as pioneers of [[Brit funk]]. The band started out as Hott Waxx in the early 1970s.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18240/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Ron Wynn |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=21 March 2009}}</ref> They included [[Phil Fearon]] (Galaxy and Kandidate) and Lloyd Phillips (Kandidate), brother of guitarist Paul, before becoming Hi-Tension and riding high on the Brit funk wave with the tracks, "Hi Tension" and "British Hustle". 

The group was composed of [[sibling|brothers]] Paul McLean ([[lead guitar]]) and Patrick McLean ([[saxophone]]); brothers David Joseph ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]/[[singing|lead vocals]]) and Ken Joseph ([[bass guitar]]); uncle and nephew Jeffrey Guishard ([[percussion instrument|percussion]]/lead vocals) and Leroy Williams ([[congas]]); Paul Phillips ([[rhythm guitar]]/vocals), David Reid ([[drum]]s) and [[Courtney Pine]] (saxophone on tour).<ref name="AMG"/>

The band split in the early 1980s with David Joseph pursuing a [[solo (music)|solo]] career. In 1984, Ken Joseph, Leroy Williams and Jeffrey Guishard reformed the band (with old members David Joseph and Paul Phillips playing on the [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] sessions) and released "Rat Race" in 1984, and "[[Happy (Surface song)|You Make Me Happy]]" in 1985.<ref name="AMG"/> Neither [[cover version]] made the [[UK Singles Chart]].

\'\'\'James Ramey\'\'\' (August 17, 1944 &ndash; October 28, 1970), better known as \'\'\'Baby Huey\'\'\', was an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer. He was the frontman for the band [[Baby Huey & the Babysitters]], whose single LP for [[Curtom Records]] in 1971 was influential in the development of [[hip hop music]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/baby-huey-mn0000765086/biography |title=Baby Huey &#124; Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date=1970-10-28 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
A native of [[Richmond, Indiana]], James Ramey moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]] at the age of nineteen, and worked with several local bands as a singer. One while he was still in high school was called the Vets. Due to a glandular disorder, Ramey was a large man, weighing about 350 pounds (160&nbsp;kg).<ref name="simmonds">{{cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy |title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|year=2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=1-556-52754-3|page=41}}</ref> His size contributed to his stage presence, but also to health problems. Nevertheless, he made light of his condition, adopting the stage name "Baby Huey" after [[Paramount Pictures]]\' giant duckling [[Baby Huey|cartoon character of the same name]]. In 1963, Ramey, organist/trumpeter [[Melvyn "Deacon" Jones]], and guitarist [[Johnny Ross]] founded a band called [[Baby Huey & the Babysitters]], which became a popular local act and released several 45 RPM singles. The four songs, "Beg Me", "Monkey Man", "Messin\' with the Kid" and "Just Being Careful" were spread over various single releases.

During the late-1960s, the band followed the lead of [[Sly & the Family Stone]] and became a [[psychedelic soul]] act. Huey began wearing an [[Afro]] and donned psychedelic African-inspired robes, and adding sing-song, self-referential rhymes to his live performances. According to his bandmates, Ramey\'s rhymes were very similar in style to those later popularized by [[rappers]] in [[hip-hop music]]. The Babysitters were a popular live act, but never took the time out to record an album.

In 1969, the band\'s agent Marv Heiman secured them an audition with [[Curtom Records]] arranger [[Donny Hathaway]]. Heiman states that Hathaway came by the Thumbs Up club and was very impressed by the act, and got Curtom Records head [[Curtis Mayfield]] to come the following night.<ref name="h2c2harlem.com">{{cite web|author= |url=http://h2c2harlem.com/2010/01/14/curtis-mayfield-and-the-black-rock-connection/ |title=Curtis Mayfield and the Black Rock Connection \xe2\x80\x94 The Hip Hop Culture Center In Harlem |publisher=H2c2harlem.com |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Mayfield wanted to sign Baby Huey, but not the band. Although the band participated in the recording of Ramey\'s debut album, there were feelings of unease among them, and Jones quit the band during the recording. It\'s also likely that Ross had quit some time before.

By 1970, Ramey had developed an addiction to heroin, and his weight had increased to over 400 pounds. He began regularly missing gigs or turning up late, and, at the insistence of his bandmates, briefly entered [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] in the spring of 1970. In addition to the heroin problem, Ramey was also drinking. Melvyn Jones had described in his book an incident that took place: while pouring his breakfast cereal, Ramey\'s drug kit fell out of the box.<ref name="h2c2harlem.com"/>

==Death==
On October 28, 1970, James Ramey died of a drug-related heart attack at the age of twenty-six in a Chicago motel room.<ref name="simmonds" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir |title=All Music Guide to Soul: The Definitive Guide to R&B and Soul|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0-879-30744-7|page=28}}</ref> His funeral was held on November 1, in his native Richmond, Indiana, and he was buried there in Glen Havens Memorial Gardens.

==Legacy==
Baby Huey\'s album, \'\'The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend\'\', was released posthumously. Produced by Curtis Mayfield, the album featured several Mayfield compositions, as well as a cover of [[Sam Cooke]]\'s "[[A Change Is Gonna Come (song)|A Change Is Gonna Come]]" and two original compositions by Ramey. The album did not sell well upon its original release, and was largely forgotten by the mainstream. Today, the album is considered a classic of its period.

On October 7, 1971, \'\'[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]\'\' magazine ran a small piece on how his mother, Mrs. Ernestine Ramey Saine, was granted authorization to audit the records of two recording firms including Curtom Records. The order also permitted her to evaluate an undetermined estate left by him. According to Chicago attorney Vernon M. Rhinehart, Ramey had a salary that was $3,500 per week.<ref>Garage Hangover [http://www.garagehangover.com/?q=babyhuey Jet Magazine October 7, 1971, Page 52]</ref>

Several songs from \'\'The Baby Huey Story\'\', including "Hard Times", "Listen to Me", and "Mighty Mighty Children", have been frequently sampled by [[hip hop production|hip hop producers]] since the 1980s. "Hard Times" alone has been sampled by dozens of artists, including [[Chill Rob G]] ("Ride The Rhythm", \'\'[[Ride the Rhythm]] (1989)\'\'), [[Ice Cube]] ("The Birth", \'\'[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]\'\'), [[A Tribe Called Quest]] ("Can I Kick It? (Spirit Mix)", \'\'[[People\'s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm]]\'\'), [[Ghostface Killah]] ("Buck 50", \'\'[[Supreme Clientele]]\'\'), and others. [[John Legend]] and [[The Roots]] covered "Hard Times" for their 2010 album \'\'[[Wake Up! (John Legend and The Roots album)|Wake Up!]]\'\'. Many people, including the Babysitters themselves, see \'\'The Baby Huey Story\'\' as a significant and important influence on hip hop music. 
The dancefloor hit "Remember me" by The Blueboy (Mid to late 1990s) clearly uses its pace and much of its score from Baby Huey\'s "Hard Times" song.

\'\'The Baby Huey Story: The Living Legend\'\' is the only available release of Baby Huey. Several singles, including "Beg Me", "Monkey Man", "Messin\' with the Kid" and "Just Being Careful" are not included.

III and IV line-ups]] of [[Deep Purple]] and briefly fronting [[Black Sabbath]] in the mid-1980s, as well as working with Black Sabbath guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] as a solo artist. In addition to being an active session musician, Hughes also maintains a notable solo career. He fronted the supergroup [[Black Country Communion]] from 2009 to 2013 and from late 2013 to early 2015, [[California Breed]].

==History==
Hughes fronted [[Finders Keepers (band)|Finders Keepers]] in the 1960s as bassist/vocalist, as well as the British [[funk rock]] band [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18353|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic bio.]</ref> Hughes was recruited to replace [[Roger Glover]] as bassist in [[Deep Purple]] in 1973, though he considered himself more a vocalist than a bassist. He was reportedly uninterested in the Deep Purple job until some of the other members proposed that [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Free (band)|Free]] be brought in as co-lead vocalist.  Though the recruitment of Rodgers fell through, Hughes had now become interested in the "two-lead-singer thing", and [[David Coverdale]] was later hired as Deep Purple\'s lead vocalist.<ref name="HughesInterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.vintagerock.com/index.php?option=com_content&id=46 |title=The Glenn Hughes Interview |work=Vintage Rock.com |accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref> The two would ultimately share lead vocal duties in the band until their break-up in 1976. Battling severe [[cocaine]] addiction,<ref>\'\'Gettin\' Tighter: The Story Of Deep Purple Mark 4,\'\' documentary film.</ref>  Hughes embarked on a solo career following his departure from the group, releasing his first solo album in 1977 called \'\'[[Play Me Out]]\'\'.

In 1982, he joined with ex-[[Pat Travers]] guitarist [[Pat Thrall]] to form [[Hughes/Thrall]], and they released one [[Hughes/Thrall (album)|self-titled album]] which went virtually unnoticed at the time. Part of the reason for the album\'s obscurity was the inability to support it with a proper tour due to both parties suffering from drug addiction. As Hughes stated in a 2007 interview, "The Hughes-Thrall album was a brilliant, brilliant album, but we only did 17 shows because we were too loaded."<ref name="HughesInterview"/> It is now often cited by many fans/musicians to be their favourite Glenn Hughes album. In the mid-1980s, Hughes recorded several different albums with bands and artists including [[Phenomena (band)|Phenomena]] (\'\'Phenomena\'\', \'\'[[Phenomena II]]: Dream Runner\'\'), [[Gary Moore]] (\'\'[[Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)|Run For Cover]]\'\'), and [[Black Sabbath]] (\'\'[[Seventh Star]]\'\'; originally a solo album by Sabbath guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] that was released as a Sabbath album due to record label pressure).

Hughes\' health problems due to overeating, drugs and alcohol began to seriously affect his musical projects, and this contributed to very short stints with Gary Moore and Tony Iommi, as Hughes was unable to tour with them properly due to his bad health. By the end of the decade, Hughes\' realised his ongoing [[Drug abuse|drug]] problem was derailing him, and by 1991 a clean, sober and fully rejuvenated Hughes returned with the vocal for the hit "[[What Time Is Love?|America: What Time Is Love?]]" with [[The KLF|KLF]].  He also recorded all the vocals for former [[Europe (band)|Europe]] guitarist [[John Norum]]\'s solo album \'\'[[Face the Truth (John Norum album)|Face the Truth]]\'\'. He then re-embarked on a solo career that he has primarily focused on to date. In 1999, Hughes did a short tribute tour to [[Tommy Bolin]] in Texas, with Tommy\'s brother Johnnie (of [[Black Oak Arkansas]]) on drums.

In 2005 Hughes released \'\'[[Soul Mover]]\'\' supporting it with a European tour.  He also collaborated with [[Black Sabbath]] guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] on the 2005 album \'\'[[Fused (Tony Iommi album)|Fused]]\'\'.  Hughes then released \'\'[[Music for the Divine]]\'\' in 2006, which featured [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] members [[Chad Smith]] and [[John Frusciante]]. Hughes toured in support of the album throughout Europe in autumn 2006.

Released on [[Edel Records]] on 17 November 2007 is \'\'Live in Australia\'\', an acoustic CD and companion DVD of a performance at Sydney\'s famous "Basement" club. The show features songs from most recent Hughes albums, Purple classics and rare gems and covers.

His newest album, \'\'[[First Underground Nuclear Kitchen]]\'\' was released on 9 May 2008 in Europe and on 12 May in the rest of the world.
In 2009, Hughes formed [[Black Country Communion]] with [[Jason Bonham]] (drums), [[Joe Bonamassa]] (guitar) and [[Derek Sherinian]] (keyboards). The band has released three albums as of October 2012 and disbanded in March 2013 following the departure of guitarist Bonamassa.

In July 2010 Hughes appeared as a guest vocalist (together with singer Jorn Lande) fronting Heaven & Hell at the High Voltage Rock Festival in London as a tribute to the late [[Ronnie James Dio]].

Hughes\' autobiography was published in May 2011 by British specialist limited edition publishers [[Foruli]]. The book, titled \'Deep Purple And Beyond: Scenes From The Life Of A Rock Star\', was co-written with author [[Joel McIver]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=137091 |title=GLENN HUGHES: More Autobiography Details Revealed |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> and featured contributions by [[Tony Iommi]], [[David Coverdale]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Tom Morello]], as well as a foreword by [[Lars Ulrich]] of [[Metallica]]. An extended paperback edition, retitled \'Glenn Hughes: The Autobiography\', was published in late 2011 by Jawbone Press.

[[File:Glenn Hughes 20080626.jpeg|thumb]]

On 13 September 2012 Glenn Hughes and [[Derek Sherinian]] met [[Bako Sahakyan]], the president of de facto independent [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] and organised a concert in [[Stepanakert]].<ref>[http://www.slaq.am/arm/news/73062/ The President of Artsakh meets the famous rock musicians, Slaq.am]</ref>

In 2013, Hughes makes a special guest appearance on the debut, self-titled album from [[Device (heavy metal band)|Device]]. Hughes is featured on the song "Through It All" accompanying [[David Draiman]] on Vocals.

In April 2013 Hughes appeared in Readings, Carlton for an Australian launch of \'\'[[Glen Hughes: The Autobiography]]\'\'.

Hughes has been touring as a member of [[Kings of Chaos (band)|Kings of Chaos]], as lead vocals, backing vocals and acoustic guitars since early 2013.

In late 2013 he formed a new band called [[California Breed]] with drummer [[Jason Bonham]] and guitarist [[Andrew Watt]]. In 2015, [[California Breed]] announced that they had broken up. The group released one self-titled album in 2014. [http://classicrock.teamrock.com/news/2015-01-16/california-breed-are-no-more]

\'\'\'Barbara Ann ("Bobbi") Humphrey\'\'\' (born April 25, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] [[flutist]] and [[Singing|singer]] who plays [[jazz Fusion|fusion]], [[jazz-funk]] and [[soul-jazz]] styles. Bobbi Humphrey has performed for audiences around the world.

She was born in [[Marlin, Texas]], and raised in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. Humphrey graduated from [[Lincoln High School (Dallas)]] in 1968.  Her flute training included classical and [[jazz]] styles in high school.  She continued her studies at [[Texas Southern University]] and [[Southern Methodist University]]. [[Dizzy Gillespie]] saw Humphrey play at a talent contest at Southern Methodist, and inspired her to pursue a musical career in [[New York City]]. She followed his advice, getting her first big break performing at the [[Apollo Theatre]] on Amateur Night.

==Recording notes==
[[Stevie Wonder]] appeared on "Home Made Jam" which was recorded during the \'\'Freestyle\'\' sessions in 1977/78, and released as the lead track on Bobbi Humphrey\'s second Epic album in 1978. \'\'Home Made Jam\'\' was released as one of Bobbi Humphrey\'s first disco 12" singles and gained airplay across the US, UK and Europe. The 7" and 12" single also carried another track as its b-side (but edited) from the album called "Sunset Burgundy"  which in itself became popular with radio stations and DJs of the day. The 2011 CD remastered \'\'Freestyle\'\' album included the 12" extended version of "Home Made Jam" as well as the edited version of "Sunset Burgundy" as bonus tracks.

Bobbi Humphrey\'s last album for Epic was \'\'The Good Life\'\', recorded in 1978/79 at Rosebud Recording Studios, New York. The album is notable for the list of supporting musicians that included Richard Tee, Eric Gale, Ralph MacDonald, Christopher Parker and Marcus Miller - all musicians that were part of the New York contemporary jazz scene at the time. All of the listed musicians were appearing on most of the albums being recorded by Earl Klugh, George Benson, Bob James, Lonnie Liston Smith and Joe Sample and more.  The album cover photography is by Dan Weaks. \'\'The Good Life\'\' LP (Epic US Cat No: JE/BL 35607) has not been made available on CD as at 2013. The original album was deleted from Sony\'s catalogue in the 1990s.

\'\'\'Imagination\'\'\' were a three piece band, who came to prominence in the early 1980s. They had [[Record chart|chart]] [[Hit record|hits]] in 28 countries, earning four [[Music recording sales certification|platinum discs]], nine [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] and more than a dozen [[Music recording sales certification|silver discs]] around the world between 1981 and 1983.

==Band members==
Singer/keyboardist \'\'\'[[Leee John]]\'\'\' was working as a backing vocalist for [[The Delfonics]], [[Chairmen of the Board]], [[The Velvelettes]] and [[The Elgins]]<ref name="AM">{{cite web|url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/imagination-mn0000078255/biography |first= Andy |last= Kellman |title= Imagination \xe2\x80\x93 Artist Biography |publisher= [[AllMusic]]. [[All Media Network]] |accessdate= 3 March 2009}}</ref> when he met \'\'\'Ashley Ingram\'\'\', a guitarist/bassist (born 27 November 1960, [[Northampton]]). John and Ingram formed a songwriting partnership, resolving to start their own \'slinky, sexy and erotic\' group, working in a short-lived band called Fizzz. Whilst they were auditioning for another short-lived band, Midnight Express, they met drummer \'\'\'[[Errol Kennedy]]\'\'\' (born 9 June 1953, [[Montego Bay]] [[Jamaica]]) who, at a very young age had learned to drum in the [[Boys\' Brigade]] and [[Air Training Corps]]. Kennedy was a member of the London based soul-funk band TFB (Typical Funk Band) later known as [[Central Line (band)|Central Line]] prior to co-founding Midnight Express.

==Career==
Formed in 1981,<ref name="AM"/> the trio took a demo tape of a track called "Body Talk" to producers [[Jolley & Swain]]. It was released as a single in April 1981 under the group name Imagination, a name that the group chose as a tribute to [[John Lennon]]. The track reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 1981, selling 250,000 copies in the UK and spending eighteen weeks in the Top 50. They had two more [[hit single]]s that year, "In and Out of Love" (September) and "Flashback" (November), both of which peaked at number 16, all from their debut album, also called \'\'[[Body Talk (Imagination album)|Body Talk]]\'\'.

Their biggest hit, "[[Just an Illusion]]", peaked at number two in March 1982 ("Just an Illusion" would later be used as the end title song to the 1986 film, \'\'[[F/X]]\'\'); followed by "Music and Lights" (number five in June), "In the Heat of the Night" (number 22 in September, also the name of their second album) and "[[Changes (Imagination song)|Changes]]" (number 31 in December).<ref name="UK">{{cite book|first= David |last= Roberts |year= 2006 |title= British Hit Singles & Albums |edition= 19th |publisher= [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Limited]] |location= London |isbn= 1-904994-10-5 |page= 267}}</ref> This was accompanied by a sell-out [[concert tour]] of Europe, with 22 dates in the UK. The trio frequently appeared on [[BBC Television]]\'s \'\'[[Top of the Pops]]\'\', and other pop music television programmes, with a distinctive [[Exotic dancer|exotic]] style, reminiscent of [[Roman Senate|Roman senators]], [[harem]] orderlies and [[Slavery|slaves]]. John made a guest appearance on \'\'[[Doctor Who]]\'\' in 1983. They were also known for their esoteric album [[Liner notes|sleeve notes]].

Following this the success of the group in the UK waned, but they continued to perform, tour and record.<ref name="AM"/> In 1987, they were signed to [[RCA Records]] and recorded two albums and seven more singles. At the end of 1987 Kennedy left the band. John with new members, Nat Augustin and Peter Royer continued and recorded a last album \'\'Fascination of the Physical\'\', in 1990. The band split in 1992.

John went back to acting, but re-surfaced as a singer in the reality television show, \'\'[[Reborn in the USA]]\'\'. Ingram also enjoyed success as a songwriter for [[Des\'ree]].

\'\'\'Keziah Jones\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Olufemi Sanyaolu\'\'\' on 10 January 1968 in [[Lagos]], Nigeria) is a [[Nigerian]] singer-songwriter and guitarist. He describes his musical style as "Blufunk", which is a fusion between raw [[blues]] elements and hard, edgy [[funk]] rhythms. Also his Nigerian roots in [[Yoruba music]] and [[soul music]] can be considered a major influence on his sound.

He is known for his distinctive style of guitar playing, including his percussive right-hand technique which is similar to a bass guitarist\'s [[Slapping (music)|slapping]] technique.

== Biography ==

Olufemi Sanyaolu a.k.a. Keziah Jones is the son of Oshodolamu Sanyaolu; Chief of a [[Yoruba ethnic group]] and successful [[industrialist]] and Abiola Sanyaolu. Born on 10 January 1968, Jones spent his early childhood in a large family in a part of Nigeria in the city of Lagos. From a young age he was being prepared to follow his father\'s footsteps in the family concern and was expected to have an academic career. Therefore his father enrolled him in a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Public School]] in London and he left Nigeria at the age of eight to be educated in England.

\'\'"I had to find a way out of all that, and music was it!"\'\'{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} By the age of 13 he had discovered the old school piano and taught himself how to play and write songs. Three years later he switched to the guitar, increasingly neglecting his studies. After scraping through exams he went against his father\'s wishes and family tradition even more by skipping school and [[busking]] in the streets, clubs and [[London Underground]], constantly avoiding the police.

Jones led a [[bohemian]] lifestyle for several years instead of the one envisaged for him. "Lose all time, love your mind, free your soul!" were words from his song [[Free Your Soul]]. Moving from London to [[Paris]] and back again frequently accompanied only by his guitar, the young Jones acquired a reputation as a talented musician and charismatic performer with a unique "hard funk" style. In 1991, whilst busking in London\'s Portobello Road, Keziah was discovered by composer and ex-keyboard player for Sailor and [[Culture Club]], [[Phil Pickett]] quickly evolving into full-time management of the artist. After a brief but near disastrous flirtation with Capitol Records in the USA, in 1992, Pickett signed Keziah to Emmanuel de Buretel\'s Delabel label for his debut album \'\'[[Blufunk Is a Fact]]\'\'. Recording in London with producer [[Kevin Armstrong (guitarist)|Kevin Armstrong]], included in the worldwide success of the project was Keziah\'s first single "Rhythm is Love." Jones attributes his [[Paris M\xc3\xa9tro|Parisian subway]] experiences as highly instrumental to his by now blossoming career in his official biography.<ref>[http://www.keziahjones.com/category/biography/ Keziah Jones Official Biography]</ref> By 2008, Jones had recorded eight albums and one DVD. After performing many shows and festivals throughout the world between 2009 and 2012, late in 2012 Keziah Jones was back in Lagos preparing to record his new studio album set for world wide release on [[Because Music]] in 2013

== Influences ==

Keziah often cites [[Fela Kuti]], [[Miles Davis]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] as important influences.

== Art ==

Keziah Jones also draws,paints and writes poetry. He is a photographer and has produced short films, including one entitled \'\'[[BLACKSPEEDTEXT]]\'\' This film, his music and the other facets of his artistic life reflect his experiences on the streets.

== Personal life ==
Keziah was married to Anglo-Nigerian singer Akure Wall in 1994.
they separated in 1996.

On 14 January 2012 Keziah married Hauwa Mukan, they separated in December 2013.

\'\'\'Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings\'\'\' are an American [[funk]]/[[soul music|soul]] band signed to [[Daptone Records]]. They are spearheads of a revivalist movement that aims to capture the essence of funk/soul music as it was at its height in the mid-1960s to mid-1970s. Part of the way this is achieved is to shun modern digital recording methods in favour of using traditional analog recording equipment.

==Desco: the early years==
The original incarnation of the band, the Soul Providers, were formed in the mid-1990s by Philip Lehman and Gabriel Roth, AKA Bosco Mann. The Soul Providers began recording an album consisting of [[James Brown]] inspired instrumentals and vocal collaborations with [[Deep Funk]] recording artist [[Lee Fields]]. During these sessions Roth and Lehman discovered vocalist [[Sharon Jones (singer)|Sharon Jones]] after she recorded backing vocals for a Fields track. They were impressed enough to record a solo track with Jones entitled "Switchblade", a track that had originally been intended for a man to record. This track along with another Jones solo, "The Landlord", were included on the Soul Providers debut release \'\'Soul Tequila\'\', released circa 1996 on the French label Pure Records (defunct). Lehman and Roth then started a new label in Brooklyn, New York. Desco Records was born taking its name from Desco Vacuum, a vacuum cleaner store in West 41st Street underneath which they utilized the basement as studio space and an office to administer and distribute the label. Sugarman 3 organist Adam Scone just happened to live upstairs in the same building.  The \'\'Soul Tequila\'\' album was then reissued as a vinyl only LP renamed \'\'Gimme The Paw\'\'. The record, which featured Lehman\'s pet dog Spike on the cover, only kept one of the Sharon Jones collaborations, "Switchblade", omitting "The Landlord".

[[Image:Dap kings 5257766w.jpg|thumb|Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings at the Moers Festival 2007]]
Having established a scene in New York of performers, Desco aimed to showcase a stable of artists with revue style shows and concentrated on releasing vinyl 45 records by a number of artists including Sugarman 3, The Daktaris, The Mighty Imperials, Naomi Davis & The Knights of 41st Street, Lee Fields, Joseph Henry and Sharon Jones, who backed by the Soul Providers who had become the Desco house band, released three 45\'s on the label. Desco Records were gaining intrigue and reputation for quality amongst soul/funk collectors and enthusiasts. Many people who bought the early records were unsure that they were modern recordings as recording dates were deliberately omitted from the labels and were often marketed as being released in the 1970s. Two other Soul Providers albums were released, an instrumental soundtrack to a mysterious Sam Lung Kung-Fu film, \'\'The Revenge Of Mr Mopoji\'\', credited to Mike Jackson And The Soul Providers and a Lee Fields solo album \'\'Let\'s Get A Groove On\'\' where the Soul Providers provided the backing.

== Daptone: a new label and the birth of the Dap-Kings ==
In 2000, due to a growing difference of opinion, Lehman and Roth decided to go separate ways and both set up new labels. Philip Lehman set up Soul Fire Records (now defunct, the back catalogue is handled by [[Truth & Soul Records]]). Gabriel Roth went on to start [[Daptone Records]] with [[Sugarman 3]] saxophonist Neal Sugarman. The Soul Providers split and a new band, the Dap-Kings formed. The band consisted of label owners Roth, AKA Bosco Mann, on bass and Neal Sugarman on saxophone, plus original Soul Providers: guitarist Binky Griptite, organist [[Victor Axelrod|Earl Maxton]], percussionist Fernando Velez and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. Joining them were original members of the Mighty Imperials whose album, \'\'Thunder Chicken\'\', was the last release on the Desco label: tenor saxophonist Leon Michels and drummer Homer Steinweiss.

Having secured a summer residency at The Boite, a club in Barcelona, Spain, the band recorded an LP, \'\'[[Dap Dippin\' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings]]\'\' in 2001. A few hundred copies were pressed, so that sales during the residency would provide financial backing on what would have otherwise been a financially disastrous trip. With promotional copies reaching notable funk DJs and reviewers, the album gained a significant reputation and was officially released as the first LP and CD on Daptone Records in 2002 to universal acclaim amongst enthusiasts. In their review at the time, quarterly hip-hop and funk magazine \'\'Big Daddy\'\' (defunct) suggested that it might be the best new funk album ever, credited Roth with being "one of the best analogue producers there is" and stated "this LP is a major triumph and a new standard has been set".

Following the album, three 45s not included on the album were also released: "What If We all Stopped Paying Taxes", released in 2002 just ahead of the U.S. Election, was a militant anti-war statement denouncing the [[Iraq War]]. "Genuine (parts 1 & 2" (2004) was an uncompromisingly hard funk record which firmly kept the interest of enthusiasts. And their cover of "[[Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)]]", released in 2005, was apparently recorded for a KFC commercial in 2002 but was never used.

==Personnel changes==
By this time there were a few personnel changes, as organist [[Victor Axelrod|Earl Maxton]] and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi officially became members of Antibalas, a New York-based afrobeat band. Whilst Maxton was not replaced on organ, trumpeter David Guy was recruited on trumpet. Also from the Budos Band, Thomas Brenneck, a second guitarist was added. In 2003 the Daptone Recording Studio, complete with a sixteen track analogue tape machine was open for business. It was originally intended to record two albums back-to-back to speed up the next release process. However during the final sessions of the first of these albums, Gabriel Roth suffered serious eye injuries in a car crash on his way home from the studio. This led to a break in the recording process and ultimately plans to limit the sessions to only one album. Their second LP and CD, \'\'[[Naturally (Sharon Jones album)|Naturally]]\'\', was then released in 2005. This album was a more broad-based album than the first (which almost completely consisted of funk numbers) and included a mix of both soul and funk influences. The sleeve notes, written by Gabriel Roth, provided some insight into the vision behind the music, "Somewhere between banging on logs and the invention of M.I.D.I. technology we have made a terrible wrong turn. We must have ridden right past our stop. We should have stepped down off the train at that moment when rhythm and harmony and technology all culminated to a single [[Otis Redding]] whine. That moment of the truest, most genuine expression of what it means to be human." The production and recording values of this album were also noticeably crisper than that of the first - attaining a sound similar to the kind of production standard achieved by James Brown at his height, rather than the slightly duller "scratchy 45" sound of the original album. With, again, international acclaim amongst enthusiasts and a steadily growing base of both fans and now imitators, the band embarked on more extensive international tours and promotion of the album.

Leon Michels left the band soon after the release of \'\'Naturally\'\' to help start a new label, [[Truth & Soul Records]], on the back of a solo LP that was originally intended to be released on Daptone, Sounding Out The City, credited to El Michels Affair. The label also filled the void left when Philip Lehman closed the Soul Fire label and moved to the Bahamas, leaving the scene altogether. The back catalogue of Soul Fire was then handled by Truth & Soul Records who, along with Soul Fire often used many of the same artists in their stable, such as Lee Fields, Homer Steinweiss and Thomas Brenneck but of whom Leon Michels had been the biggest collaborator. Michels replacement in the Dap-kings came as Ian Hendrickson-Smith, a local saxophone player who has released several jazz albums under his own name.

==Collaborations==
The Dap-Kings were then hired as session musicians on a number of projects associated with New York-based DJ/producer/recording artist [[Mark Ronson]]. Most notable of these is their extensive inclusion and somewhat unheralded{{clarify|date=October 2012}} contribution to [[Amy Winehouse]]\'s album \'\'[[Back to Black]]\'\' (2006). Six of the album\'s eleven tracks feature various members of the Dap-Kings with two notable hits from the album, "Rehab" and "You Know I\'m No Good", extensively featuring the Dap-Kings. A further engineering credit goes to Gabriel Roth and several tracks recorded at Daptone Studios are mis-credited as "Dapking Studios". Again various members of the band feature on Ronson\'s second album, \'\'[[Version (album)|Version]]\'\' (2007), providing contributions on all but one of the album\'s fourteen tracks. The Dap-Kings then became the backing band used on Amy Winehouse\'s first U.S. tour.

In 2007 the Dap-Kings worked with British singer [[Ben Westbeech]] to record a new version of his song "So Good Today"; it was released to mark the first anniversary of Brownswood recordings, the label Westbeech is signed to in the UK. Sharon Jones lends her vocals on one song "The Way We Lived", on [[Wax Tailor]]\'s second album \'\'[[Hope & Sorrow]]\'\', released in April 2007. Sharon Jones is also featured on releases by They Might Be Giants (\'\'[[The Else]]\'\') and Rufus Wainright (\'\'[[Release the Stars]]\'\').

Jones recently contributed six period numbers by Bessie Smith and others to the soundtrack for the film \'\'[[The Great Debaters]]\'\', recorded in the legendary Ardent Studio in Memphis. Jones is also a featured on the Verve Records \'\'Baby Loves Jazz\'\' books/CDs and has even had her own character books published by Penguin Books in conjunction with the series, entitled \'\'Ella the Elephant: Scats Like That\'\'.

Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings are featured on [[Michael Bubl\xc3\xa9]]\'s 2009 album, \'\'Crazy Love\'\', in the track "Baby (You\'ve got what it takes)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Youve-Takes-Sharon-Jones-Dap-Kings/dp/B002RB680G |title=Baby [You\'ve Got What It Takes&#93; [With Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings&#93;: Michael Bubl\xc3\xa9: MP3 Downloads |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>
In the fall of 2009 Sharon Jones and David Guy appeared with Phish for their musical costume at Phish\'s Festival 8 in Indio California, where they covered The [[Rolling Stones]]\' \'\'[[Exile on Main St.]]\'\'.

The Dap-Kings horn section backed [[The Heavy (band)|The Heavy]] in a January 18, 2010 appearance on the \'\'[[Late Show with David Letterman]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzI1ZrMbVio ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The Dap-Kings appear on the 2012 [[David Byrne]] and [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]] collaboration \'\'[[Love This Giant]]\'\'. Dap-Kings drummer Homer Steinwess appears on St. Vincent\'s [[St. Vincent (album)|self-titled fifth album]].

In October 2012, the Dap-Kings horn section also appeared with [[Muse (band)|Muse]] on \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\', providing support during their performance of [[The 2nd Law|Panic Station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muse.mu/news,videos-madness-panic-station-on-snl_1438.htm?f=news&pg=|title=Videos: Madness and Panic Station on SNL|publisher=muse.mu |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2012-10-11}}</ref>

In 2015, The Dap-Kings horn section collaborated with the [[Antibalas]] horn section, [[Mark Ronson]], and [[Bruno Mars]] to record \'\'[[Uptown Funk]]\'\' and other tracks off of Mark Ronson\'s 2015 album [[Uptown Special]].

\'\'\'KC and the Sunshine Band\'\'\' is an American [[musical ensemble|musical group]]. Founded in 1973 in [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], [[Florida]], its style has included [[funk]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[disco]].<ref name=NYT/> Their most well known songs include the disco hits "[[That\'s the Way (I Like It)]]", "[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]", "[[I\'m Your Boogie Man]]", "[[Keep It Comin\' Love]]", "[[Get Down Tonight]]", "[[Boogie Shoes]]", "[[Give It Up (KC song)|Give It Up]]", and "[[Please Don\'t Go (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Please Don\'t Go]]".  The band took its name from lead vocalist [[Harry Wayne Casey]]\'s last name ("KC") and the "Sunshine Band" from KC\'s home state of Florida (\'The Sunshine State\').

==1970s==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
The group was formed in 1973 by [[Harry Wayne Casey]] (KC), a record store employee and part-timer at TK Records in Hialeah, Florida (an independent city in Dade County, Florida). KC originally called the band KC & The Sunshine Junkanoo Band, as he used studio musicians from TK and a local [[Junkanoo]] band called the Miami Junkanoo Band. He was then introduced to [[Richard Finch (musician)|Richard Finch]], who was doing engineering work on records for TK. This was the beginning of the Casey-Finch musical collaboration. The initial members were just Casey and Finch. Guitarist Jerome Smith (June 18, 1953 - July 28, 2000) and drummer Robert Johnson, both TK [[recording studio|studio]] [[session musician|musicians]], were added later.

The first few songs, "Blow Your Whistle" (September 1973) and "Sound Your Funky Horn" (February 1974), were released as singles, and did well enough on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] and overseas that TK wanted a follow up single and album. However, while working on [[demo (music)|demos]] for KC & the Sunshine Band, the song "[[Rock Your Baby]]" ([[George McCrae]]) was created, featuring Smith on guitar, and became a number one [[hit record|hit]] in 51 countries in mid-1974. The band\'s "Queen of Clubs", which featured uncredited [[human voice|vocals]] by McCrae, was a hit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], peaking at #7, and they went on a [[concert tour|tour]] there in 1975.

With the release of the self-titled [[music recording sales certification|triple platinum second album]] \'\'[[KC and the Sunshine Band (album)|KC and the Sunshine Band]]\'\' in 1975 came the group\'s first major U.S. hit with "[[Get Down Tonight]]". It topped the R&B chart in April and hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] in August. "[[That\'s the Way (I Like It)]]" also became a number one hit<ref name=NYT/> in November 1975 and the group did well at the 1976 [[Grammy Award]]s. The 1976 album \'\'[[Part 3]]\'\' yielded two number one singles: "[[I\'m Your Boogie Man]]"<ref name=NYT/> and "[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]".<ref name=NYT/> Another hit, "[[Keep It Comin\' Love]]", peaked at number two. Their success lasted until the fifth album; their last chart topping hit was "[[Please Don\'t Go (KC and the Sunshine Band song)|Please Don\'t Go]]" in December 1979, hitting number one<ref name=NYT/> for one week in January 1980, and becoming the first number one hit of the 1980s. With the explosion of [[new wave music]] and the declining popularity of disco, the group explored other styles and changed labels, joining [[Epic Records]] in 1980 after TK Records went bankrupt.

With a change in styles, Casey enjoyed success, dueting with [[Teri DeSario]] with "[[Yes, I\'m Ready]]," which hit No. 2 in March 1980; the adult contemporary sound was much different from his disco hits of the 1970s, and his first major success away from the Sunshine Band.

==1980s==
In 1981, the partnership between Finch and Casey came to an acrimonious end. Two years after the release of the previous album, the group released two solo albums with new material, geared toward pop: \'\'[[The Painter]]\'\' and \'\'[[Space Cadet (album)|Space Cadet]]\'\'. These albums generated little success, but in 1982, a hit track called "[[Give It Up (KC song)|Give It Up]]" (released as a solo effort, but recorded before Casey and Finch split the partnership) from the album \'\'[[All in a Night\'s Work]]\'\' brought a return to success in the UK, and appeared two years later in the U.S. [[Top 40]]. The song was also featured on the band\'s next album, 1984\'s \'\'[[KC Ten]]\'\'. Epic Records, however, refused to issue the song as a single due to its prior failure in the U.S. Because of this, a frustrated Casey formed Meca Records, releasing the single himself on this label in a final attempt to garner the song some success in America. It worked, but the album still failed to surpass expectations. This led to the group falling into stasis around 1985 with Casey\'s retirement.

==1990s and beyond==
A revival of interest in disco music in 1991 brought Casey out of retirement. He reformed the group with entirely new members, except for two other original members (the percussionist Fermin Goytisolo and vocalist Beverly Champion-Foster) and began touring once again. Some of the original members of the band are now deceased. The new band has released a large number of [[compilation album]]s through [[Rhino Records]], along with some newly recorded material. The album \'\'[[Oh Yeah! (KC and the Sunshine Band album)|Oh Yeah!]]\'\' was released in 1993 after a ten-year gap between new albums (excluding compilations).

On July 28, 2000, Jerome Smith (rhythm guitar) died accidentally while working as a bulldozer operator.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E6DD163FF933A2575BC0A9669C8B63|title=Obituaries: Jerome Smith, 47, of K. C. and the Sunshine Band, the Hit Disco Group|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 10, 2000}}</ref>

In 2001, the band made a brief comeback into the music scene after an eight-year lull with the release of a new album titled \'\'[[I\'ll Be There for You (album)|I\'ll Be There For You]]\'\'. The album was praised by [[music journalism|critics]], but it failed to generate any impact on the [[record chart|charts]] or in sales. More recently, the group had an appearance in the 2003 remake of the [[film|movie]] \'\'[[The In-Laws (2003 film)|The In-Laws]]\'\'.

Several KC/Finch songs have been included in the \'\'[[Dance Dance Revolution]]\'\' series of dance video games.  "That\'s the Way (I Like It)" was included in the original \'\'[[Dance Dance Revolution (1998 video game)|Dance Dance Revolution]]\'\', "Shake Your Booty" was in \'\'[[Dance Dance Revolution 4thMix]]\'\' and "Get Down Tonight" was in \'\'[[DDRMAX2 Dance Dance Revolution]]\'\'. The song "Keep It Comin\' Love" was on the [[soundtrack]] of the [[film|movie]] \'\'[[Blow (film)|Blow]]\'\', about 1970s and 1980s cocaine smuggler [[George Jung]]. Additionally, many KC/Finch songs, most frequently "I Get Lifted", have been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for [[hip hop music|hip hop]] songs. In 2005, "I\'m Your Boogie Man", was featured in a rollerskating sequence in the movie, \'\'[[Roll Bounce]]\'\'.

On July 6, 2013, KC and The Sunshine Band were honored with a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk Of Stars]].<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars%20by%20date/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars: listed by date dedicated]</ref> The star was presented by [[Barry Manilow]] and city officials. Members of the [[Village People]] were also in attendance.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Biography==
King was born \'\'\'Earl Silas Johnson IV\'\'\'<ref name=musicianguide>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003810/Earl-King.html Musician Biographies: Earl King]</ref> in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. His father, a local piano player, died when King was still a baby, and he was brought up by his mother.<ref name=musicianguide /> With his mother, he started going to church at an early age.  In his youth he sang [[gospel music]], but took the advice of a friend to switch to [[blues]] to make a better living.

King started to play guitar at age 15. Soon he started entering talent contests at local clubs including the Dew Drop Inn. It was at one of those clubs where he met his idol [[Guitar Slim]].<ref name=offbeat>[[OffBeat (magazine)|OffBeat magazine]], June 2003 issue "The Legacy of Earl King"</ref> King started imitating Slim, and his presence gave a big impact on his musical directions. In 1954, when Slim was injured in an automobile accident (right around the time Slim had the #1 R&B hit with "The Things That I Used To Do"), King was deputized to continue Slim\'s band tour, representing himself as Slim. After succeeding in this role, King became a regular at the Dew Drop Inn.<ref name=offbeat />

His first recording came in 1953. He released a 78 "Have you Gone Crazy" b/w "Begging at Your Mercy" on [[Savoy Records|Savoy]] label as Earl Johnson.<ref name=musicianguide /> The following year, talent scout Johnny Vincent introduced King to [[Specialty Records|Specialty]] label,<ref name="Music"/> and he recorded some sides including "Mother\'s Love" which created a little stir locally. In 1955, King signed with Johnny Vincent\'s label, Ace.<ref name="Music"/> His first single from the label "Those Lonely, Lonely Nights" became a hit reaching #7 on the US \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p405|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com Billboard singles]</ref> He continued to record during his five-year stay at the label, and during that time, he also he started writing songs for other artists such as Roland Stone and [[Jimmy Clanton]].

In 1960, [[Dave Bartholomew]] invited King to record for the [[Imperial Records]].<ref name="Music"/> At the label, he was backed by host of musicians including [[Bob French (jazz musician)|Bob]] and George French, [[James Booker]], and [[Wardell Quezergue]]. It was at this label he recorded his signature songs "[[Come On (Earl King song)|Come On]]" and "[[Trick Bag]]".<ref name="Music"/> The former of which remained a much covered standard for decades especially for [[Jimi Hendrix]],<ref name="Music"/> [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Anson Funderburgh]]. The latter has also been widely covered including versions by [[The Meters]] and [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]].

King also co-wrote a number of songs with Bartholomew, either under his own name or under the pseudonyms of "Pearl King" and "E.C. King".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One of the best known collaborations between Bartholomew and King is the rhythm and blues standard, "[[I Hear You Knocking]]", originally recorded in 1955.  Another of the collaborations of the pair, this time in conjunction with Anita Steinman, is [[Elvis Presley]]\'s 1958 hit, "[[One Night (song)|One Night]]". Both songs were variously credited as having been co-written by \'Pearl King\' or \'E.C King\', instead of Earl King.

King recorded for Imperial till 1963, but he went without a [[recording contract]] for the remainder of the 1960s. During this time, he mostly concentrated in producing and songwriting for local labels [[NOLA Records|NOLA]] and [[Watch Records|Watch]]. His compositions from this era includes [[Professor Longhair]]\'s "[[Big Chief]]", [[Willie Tee]]\'s "Teasin\' You", and [[Lee Dorsey]]\'s "Do-Re-Mi".<ref name="Music"/> He also went to Detroit for an audition with [[Motown Records]] and recorded a few tracks in the mid 1960s. Three tracks from the session appeared on the \'\'Motown\'s Blue Evolution\'\' CD released in 1996.

In 1972, he was joined by [[Allen Toussaint]] and [[the Meters]] to record the album \'\'Street Parade\'\'. Though [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] initially showed interest in releasing it, they eventually declined. The title cut "Street Parade" was released as a single from Kansu label at the time, but the rest had to wait till 1982 to see the light of the day, when the album was finally released by [[Charly Records]] in the UK.

During the 1970s, he recorded another album \'\'That Good Old New Orleans Rock \'n Roll\'\' which was released by Sonet in 1977. He also appeared on the \'\'New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 1976\'\' album.

In the early 1980s, he also met Hammond Scott, co-owner of [[Black Top Records]],<ref name=offbeat/> and started to record for the label.<ref name="Music"/> The first album \'\'Glazed\'\', backed up by [[Roomful of Blues]] was released in 1986, and a second album, \'\'Sexual Telepathy\'\' came in 1990. It featured [[Snooks Eaglin]] as a guest on two tracks, and also [[Ronnie Earl|Ronnie Earl & The Broadcasters]] backed him up on some tracks. His third from the label \'\'Hard River To Cross\'\' (1993) was backed by [[George Porter, Jr.]], David Torkanowsky, and Herman V. Ernest, III.

In 2001, he was hospitalized for an illness during a tour to [[New Zealand]], however, that did not stop him from performing. In December of the same year, he toured Japan,<ref>[http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/bluesy/ptbf/history.html Park Tower Blues Festival History]</ref> and he continued to perform off and on locally in New Orleans until his death.<ref name="Music"/>

He died on April 17, 2003, from [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] related complications,<ref>[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2003.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com \xe2\x80\x93 accessed November 2009]</ref> just a week before the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. His funeral was held during the Festival period on April 30, and many musicians including [[Dr. John]], [[Leo Nocentelli]] and [[Aaron Neville]] were in attendance.<ref name=offbeat/> His Imperial recordings, which have been long out-of-print, were reissued on CD soon after he died. The June 2003 issue of a local music magazine \'\'[[OffBeat (magazine)|OffBeat]]\'\' paid a tribute to King by doing a series of special articles on him.<ref name=offbeat/>

\'\'\'Klymaxx\'\'\' is an all-female Pop/R&B band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==Biography==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2014}}
Klymaxx is an American all-female band created and founded by drummer and singer Bernadette Cooper. Cooper after college created the all-girl band. She also created the name \'Klymaxx\'. Klymaxx\'s uniqueness is due to the all-girl band\'s ability to play instruments, and their sound was influential because of its comedic, women power theme. Klymaxx\'s original members are (vocalist, drummer, founder) Bernadette Cooper, (vocalist) Lorena Porter (Stewart), (guitarist) Cheryl Cooley, (keyboardists ) Lynn Malsby, (keyboardists) Robbin Grider and later after the band signed to Solar records (bassist/ vocalist) Joyce Irby, was added to the band . In 1981, Klymaxx were signed to Solar Records by Dick Griffey. Their debut album was entitled \'\'Never Underestimate The Power Of A Woman\'\'. Upon beginning work on their second album, Klymaxx became one of the first acts to work with writers/producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis of The Time. The team wrote and produced many songs, including the song "Wild Girls" for their second album, entitled \'\'Girls Will Be Girls\'\'. Klymaxx remains the only female self-contained R&B/Pop Band to achieve platinum status.

===Success===
After their second Solar album in 1983, the group switched to the MCA-distributed Constellation label for \'\'[[Meeting in the Ladies Room]]\'\'. It featuring their first hit "[[The Men All Pause]]" (penned by Bernadette Cooper and Joyce Irby) and marked the beginning of their success. Griffey chose as their third single the 1985 hit "[[I Miss You (Klymaxx song)|I Miss You]]" (penned by Lynn Malsby) which peaked at #5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart and at #1 on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary]] chart. "I Miss You" remained on the Hot 100 chart for 29 weeks, a long chart run at the time, and good enough to rank it as the third-biggest-selling song of 1986, ahead of several songs that went higher in the top 10. The album also featured the hits "[[The Men All Pause]]" and "[[Meeting in the Ladies Room (song)|Meeting in the Ladies Room]]". 1986 saw the release of "[[Man Size Love]]" (which was written by Rod Temperton "Thriller") from the \'\'[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]\'\' motion picture soundtrack. The following year, this song was included on their self-titled \'\'[[Klymaxx (Klymaxx album)|Klymaxx]]\'\' album, which went on to provide more hits. The hit songs produced and written by Bernadette Cooper, "Divas Need Love Too" and "Sexy" along with the ballad "[[I\'d Still Say Yes]]", written by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] (credited as K. Edmonds), G. Scelsa, and Joyce Irby. It peaked at #18 on the Hot 100 and #8 on the adult-contemporary chart in 1987.

===Later Years===
Joyce Irby and Bernadette Cooper began successful solo careers that catapulted their careers as writers, producers and label owners, and signed and created various other solo acts, bands and groups.

After members began solo careers and Constellation was folded into MCA, the remaining members Lorena Porter, Cheryl Cooley, and Robbin Grider continued to perform around the US.

In 1990, they returned with \'\'[[The Maxx Is Back]]\'\', which featured the singles "[[Good Love (Klymaxx song)|Good Love]]" and "Don\'t Run Away." "Good Love" peaked at #4 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] charts. However, without the appeal of the most popular members Cooper and Irby, MCA released the remaining women from their contract.

Joyce Irby reunited with Lorena Shelby and Cheryl Cooley for the album titled \'\'[[One Day (Klymaxx album)|One Day]]\'\', the album was released on Irby\'s 1869 EP Wreckudz label, and featuring the single "All I Think About Is You," written by Babyface. Replacing Bernadette Cooper on drums was [[Terri Lyne Carrington]].

===Reunion===
Members of the classic Klymaxx lineup met up on an episode of the [[VH1]] series \'\'[[Bands Reunited]]\'\' in 2003 to perform some of their vintage hit singles. The show was met with favorable ratings as the drama disclosed member Cheryl Cooley unauthorized use of the name and touring as the band "Klymaxx", without the consent of the other members. Robbin Grider was missing in action at the time of the episode, and was not mentioned having been a member during the group\'s prime. In 2003 the group began touring together again with the exception of Cheryl Cooley. 

On November 15, 2009, \'\'Unsung\'\' premiered on the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] cable network The documentary \'\'Klymaxx: \'\' chronicling the story of the group\'s genesis and rise to fame.  This time, all six members of the classic lineup, including Grider, appeared. The group, including Cheryl Cooley have since reformed officially and are currently touring the country.<ref>[http://www.klymaxx.com]</ref>

\'\'\'Lakeside\'\'\' is a [[funk]] band, best known for their 1980 number one R&B hit, "[[Fantastic Voyage (Lakeside song)|Fantastic Voyage]]".

== Band history ==

===Formation and early years===
In early 1969, The Nomads met The Montereys, and formed a band and a singing group consisting of lead guitarist and founding member Stephen Shockley, Mark Wood, Tiemeyer McCain, Tony White, and Brian Marbury. The two groups played together in musical revues in the tri-state area of [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], and [[Kentucky]].

When The Montereys left the Tri-State area later in 1969 to pursue opportunities in [[New York City]], Stephen Shockley and The Nomads remained behind. Mark Wood, the other Nomads, and Stephen Shockley soon added other instrumentalists; the result was The Nomads and The Young Underground. In 1971, The Nomads and The Young Underground took on a new, singular identity: With the addition of Thomas Shelby and sister of Mark Wood\'s sister Shirley Wood, they became Ohio Lakeside Express.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref>  In 1971, the group became acquainted with Eddie Thomas of Curtom, a record label owned and operated by Mr. Thomas and his partner, [[Curtis Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rizik|first1=Chris|title=Lakeside {{!}} Soul Tracks|url=http://www.soultracks.com/lakeside.htm|website=soultracks.com|publisher=Soul Tracks|accessdate=2015-04-06}}</ref> Eddie Thomas left Curtom to form his own label: "Lakeside", which he named after the south-side of Chicago. Lakeside, the label, signed Ohio Lakeside Express, the band, with the band soon dropping "Ohio", and ultimately the "Express" as well, in favor of "Lakeside". Eddie Thomas had a number of producers expressing interest in producing an album for Lakeside, but nothing materialized at this stage in their career. That would soon change, as Shirley chose not to pursue her singing career - so they added a new singer named Ricky Abernathy.

At "Mavericks Flats", another of the big-time venues of the day, by now they added another vocalist (Otis Stokes) to replace Ricky Abernathy, and a new percussionist (Fred Lewis). The group was seen by [[Dick Griffey]], a promoter handling successful artists like Stevie Wonder.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref> Impressed by the group, he offered his friendship and advice, and began informally managing Lakeside in early 1974. It was also in 1974 that Lakeside met Frank Wilson and signed a deal with Motown.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref> Things seemed to be looking up for the band. Unfortunately, Motown was promoting/prioritizing other groups, and shelved what they had produced for Lakeside. When Frank Wilson left Motown in 1976 for ABC Dunhill, Lakeside went with him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rizik|first1=Chris|title=Lakeside {{!}} Soul Tracks|url=http://www.soultracks.com/lakeside.htm|website=soultracks.com|publisher=Soul Tracks|accessdate=2015-04-06}}</ref><ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref>

It was in 1977 that Lakeside\'s success really started to accelerate. That year, the group, going by the name Lakeside released their self-titled debut album, which featured the single, "If I Didn\'t Have You". It was also around this time that the group debuted on Soul Train, performing a Beloyd Taylor and Peter Cor composition "Shine On", which helped pave the way for what was to come. As fate would have it the time had come for Lakeside to be a major player in creating the next chapter, with the addition of barefoot drummer Fred Alexander Jr. At this time the group was being approached by Whitfield Records, Motown and Solar Records. In the end, the band chose Solar Records, owned by Dick Griffey, with stable mates [[The Whispers]], [[Shalamar]], [[Midnight Star]], [[Klymaxx]], and [[Carrie Lucas]].<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref>

===Major label success===
What was to come involved Dick Griffey, the producer who had befriended and managed  Lakeside since 1975. In 1978, Mr. Griffey started [[Solar Records]].<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref> At that same time, Norman Whitfield had been courting the group to sign with his Whitfield Records, but Dick offered the group a chance to write and co-produce their own music, which Norman was not willing to do. With that, the group decided to sign with Dick\'s new label.

The band, at this point consisting of [[bass guitarist|bassist]] Marvin Craig, [[drummer]] Fred Alexander, [[percussionist]] Fred Lewis, [[guitarist]] Steve Shockley, [[keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] Norman Beavers, [[guitarist]]/multi-instrumentalist and lead vocalist Otis Stokes, additional lead vocalist Mark Wood, background vocalists Tiemeyer McCain and Thomas Shelby found their niche with a sound that stemmed from years of playing together. The band dressed in costumes on their album covers, including pirates, 1920\'s police officers, cowboys, Arabian knights, and even Robin Hood.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rizik|first1=Chris|title=Lakeside {{!}} Soul Tracks|url=http://www.soultracks.com/lakeside.htm|website=soultracks.com|publisher=Soul Tracks|accessdate=2015-04-06}}</ref>

Despite the success of \'\'Shot of Love\'\' and "It\'s All the Way Live", the next album, \'\'[[Rough Riders (album)|Rough Riders]]\'\', didn\'t fare as well. However, the following album, 1980\'s \'\'[[Fantastic Voyage (album)|Fantastic Voyage]]\'\', exceeded all expectations. Its eponymous single, "[[Fantastic Voyage (Lakeside song)|Fantastic Voyage]]" went to reach number one on the R&B charts.  The tune remains the band\'s biggest hit, also hitting the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop charts]] (their only hit to date to do so), where it peaked at number 55. They followed this hit up with a remake of the [[Beatles]]\' song, "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", which made the R&B Top Ten again.

Subsequent to the \'\'[[Fantastic Voyage (album)|Fantastic Voyage]]\'\' album, Lakeside would go on to release six more successful ones. More hits on the R&B charts kept the group going until their change in the late 1980s.<ref name="SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco">{{cite web|title=SOLAR Records @ Disco-Disco|url=http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/solar.shtml|website=disco-disco.com|publisher=Disco-Disco|accessdate=2015-04-02}}</ref>

\'\'\'Nils Landgren\'\'\' (born 2 February 1956 in [[Degerfors]], [[Sweden]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[R&B]] [[funk]] and [[jazz]] [[trombone]] player.<ref name=wollie-kaiser>{{cite web |url=http://www.wollie-kaiser.de/timeghosthomepage/saxophonmafia/nils%20landgren.html |title=Nils Landgren (Schweden) Posaune |accessdate=2012-11-24 |publisher=Wollie-Kaiser.de}}</ref>

== Career ==
Between 1972 and 1978 he studied [[Classical music|classical trombone]] at the music college in [[Karlstad]], [[Sweden]] and continued his education in the university in [[Arvika]]. Upon meeting the Swedish Folk-Jazz pioneer [[Bengt-Arne Wallin]] as well as trombonist [[Eje Thelin]], Landgren was persuaded to move from his strict classical studies to improvisation and to begin the development of his own sound and approach to music.<ref name=wollie-kaiser/>

After his graduation, Nils moved to [[Stockholm]] to work as a professional trombone player. He was soon touring with the successful Swedish pop star, [[Bj\xc3\xb6rn Skifs]].<ref name=am>{{cite web|title =Nils Landgren: Biography |first=James|last=Monger |publisher=Allmusic| url ={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p96286|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate =2010-09-23}}</ref> Bj\xc3\xb6rn Skifs\' band, [[Blue Swede]], recorded a number one hit song in the U.S. pop charts with "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]".<ref name=wollie-kaiser/><ref name=last>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Nils+Landgren+-+Esbj%C3%B6rn+Svensson |title=Nils Landgren - Esbj\xc3\xb6rn Svensson |accessdate=2012-11-24 |publisher=Last.fm}}</ref> [[Thad Jones]] in 1981 invited Landgren to join his new big band project, called Ball of Fire, as the lead-trombonist. Since adulthood, Landgren has covered a wide number of [[genre]]s involved in most styles equally: jazz and rock, soul and hip hop, big band sessions, and solo work. By his own reckoning, Landgren\'s contributions grace at least 500 albums including such international stars as [[ABBA]], [[The Crusaders]], [[Eddie Harris]], [[Bernard Purdie|Bernard "Pretty" Purdie]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Herbie Hancock]]. 
  
In 1983 Landgren recorded and released his debut album as a solo artist. \'\'Planet Rock\'\',<ref name=am/> followed by \'\'Streetfighter\'\' in 1984, \'\'You Are My Number One\'\' in 1985, \'\'Miles from Duke\'\' with Bengt-Arne Wallin in 1987, \'\'Chapter Two 1\'\' in 1987, \'\'Chapter Two 2\'\' and \'\'Follow Your Heart\'\' in 1989. Between 1985 and 1987 Nils also performed as actor, singer, trombonist, and dancer in over 360 performances of the Swedish "play of the year", SK\xc3\x85L, as well as appearing in several TV-films as an actor.<ref name=last/>

In 1992 the first performances and recording of the \'\'\'Nils Landgren Unit\'\'\' took place. His breakthrough beyond [[Scandinavia]] occurred in 1994: It was at the [[Jazz Baltica]] Festival at Salzau in Germany, that the "Unit" became the \'\'\'Nils Landgren Funk Unit\'\'\'. The album "Live in Stockholm" (ACT 9223-2) was released that year and was the foundation for the collaboration with Siegfried Loch and his then nascent [[ACT (record label)|ACT label]].<ref name=last/>

\'\'\'Lettuce\'\'\' is a [[funk]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] that originated in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] in 1992. Its members consist of guitarists [[Eric Krasno]] and Adam "Shmeeans" Smirnoff, Neal Evans (Keyboards, [[Hammond B-3 Organ]], Piano), [[Adam Deitch]] (Drums/Percussion), Erick "E.D." Coomes (Bass), Ryan Zoidis (Saxophone), and partial-member Rashawn Ross (Trumpet). In 2011, Trumpeter Eric "Benny" Bloom replaced Rashawn Ross in the band. They are known for their energetic live shows.

==History==

Lettuce began in the summer of 1992, when all of its members attended a music program at [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston, MA as teenagers.<ref>http://www.royalfamilyrecords.com/lettuce</ref> Brought together by the influence of various funk bands including [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Earth, Wind and Fire]], and [[Tower of Power]], the band jammed throughout that summer before going their separate ways.

In the fall of 1994, the band reconvened as undergrads at Berklee and attempted to play at various Boston jazz clubs, walking in and asking the club owners and other musicians if they would "let us play", giving birth to the name Lettuce.<ref>http://pop-break.com/2011/12/13/interview-lettuce/</ref>

Mainly from word of mouth, Lettuce began developing strong followings in [[New York]], [[San Francisco]], [[Chicago]], and [[Tokyo]]. They released their first CD, "Outta Here" in 2001, followed by their "Live in Tokyo" album recorded at the Blue Note in 2003.

In 2008, Lettuce released their sophomore effort, entitled "Rage!" Drawing heavily from many of funk\'s forefathers, Rage! features covers of [[Curtis Mayfield| Curtis Mayfield\'s]] "[[Move on Up]]" and [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band|Charles Wright\'s]] "Express Yourself."

In 2011, Lettuce played on the Royal Family Ball tour with their brother band, Soulive and accompanied on select shows by [[Rashawn Ross]] of the [[Dave Matthews Band]]. During this tour, they began playing new songs that would be featured on the upcoming Lettuce album coming out in 2012.<ref>http://pop-break.com/2011/12/13/interview-lettuce/</ref>

b'{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}
{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}
\'\'\'Light of the World\'\'\' were originally a forerunner of the late 1970s/early 1980s British [[jazz-funk]] movement. The band\'s name is taken from the 1974 [[Kool and the Gang]] album, \'\'[[Light of Worlds]]\'\'. The band was formed by Breeze McKrieth, Kenny Wellington, Paul Williams, Jean Paul Maunick and David Baptiste. McKreith, Wellington and Baptiste also formed the offshoot band \'\'\'Beggar & Co\'\'\'. Maunick and Williams also formed the band \'\'\'Incognito\'\'\'.

==Original line-up==
The band\'s original 1978 line up was:
*Kenny Wellington (trumpet, [[flugelhorn]], percussion, vocals, [[horn (instrument)|horn]] arrangements, producer)
*David \'Baps\' Baptiste (saxophone, flute, percussion, vocals, arrangements)
*Chris Etienne (percussion)
*Peter \'Stepper\' Hinds (keyboards)
*[[Jean-Paul \'Bluey\' Maunick]] (guitar, lead and backing vocals, producer)
*Everton McCalla (drums)
*Neville \'Breeze\' McKrieth (guitar, lead and backing vocals, producer)
*Paul \'Tubbs\' Williams (bass, lead and backing vocals)<ref name="Myspace.com/lightoftheworldmusic">[http://www.myspace.com/lightoftheworldmusic Myspace.com/lightoftheworldmusic]</ref>
 
\'Gee\' Bello (percussion, vocals) and Nat Augustin (guitar, vocals) joined the band after the death of Chris Etienne in a road accident and the departure of Jean Paul Maunick.

==Various other line-ups and spin-offs==
The Band\'s 1979 line up includes:
These members also played with the band on their many performances in clubs throughout the UK before securing their first [[recording contract]].

*Norman Walker (percussion)
*Earl Appleton (keyboards)
*Junior King (drums)
*Roger Thomas (saxophone)

The following members joined the line-up in 1979, after the [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] of the first album. The band were already signed to [[Ensign Records]]/[[Polygram]], and this followed the death of Chris Etienne when the band were in involved in a motorway crash. After auditions, Nat Augustin and Ganiyu Bello, who had travelled from [[Manchester]], joined the band. The band recorded a second album \'Round Trip\' with producer Augie Johnson of the American group Side Effect and later a prominent member of The L.A. Boppers. The recording also featured Wayne Henderson, Bobby Lyle and Miki Howard as well as string arrangements by Jorge Dalto. This was followed by a successful tour which was billed as Light of the World and Beggar & Co due to the commercial success of the Beggar & Co recording \'Somebody Help Me Out\' from Wellington, Baptiste and McKrieth who had originally formed Beggar & Co as a splinter group to operate much in the same way as the George Clinton bands, Parliament and Funkadelic.\'Somebody Help Me Out\' had sold 300,000 copies in the UK as well as being reasonably successful in other territories.

The band split up for the first time in 1981.

Wellington, Baptiste and McKreith continued [[Beggar and Co]],<ref name="Myspace.com/beggarandco">[http://www.myspace.com/beggarandco Myspace.com/beggarandco]</ref> after their first recording had hit the [[Top 40|Top 20]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "(Somebody) Help Me Out".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{cite book

Bello and Augustin continued briefly as Light of the World, before recording solo material for [[EMI Records|EMI]] and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]]. Peter Hinds was also a member of [[Atmosfear]].

There was a brief Light of the World reunion in 1982, featuring the American drummer, William Billy Carson, just before Bello and Augustin embarked on their solo recordings.

In 1985, Wellington and McKrieth reformed the band after working on some [[remix]]es with DJ, [[John Morales (musician)|John Morales]]. This included a [[remix]] of the tracks "London Town" and "Time". Light of the World reformed briefly again in 1990, recording for [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]].

Various configurations followed, including the single \'Keep The Dream Alive\' with Kenny Wellington and Nat Augustin, produced by Simon Law. This was followed by a configuration of Kenny Wellington and Bello with Jean Paul Maunick in charge of production, for another single \'One Destination\'. Bello had also put together another splinter group called The Team, and had dance floor success with the track \'Wicki Wacki House Party\'. In the meantime Augustin replaced Ashley Ingram in the group [[Imagination (band)|Imagination]] and recorded the album \'Fascination of the Physical\'.

In 1999, Wellington assembled most of the original band, including McKrieth and Baptiste, to produce another album along with the experienced Richard Bull who had previously produced tracks for Incognito. The CD \'Inner Voices\' was released by Sanctuary in 1999.

In 2009 some of the original members of the band were working together once again, with a line-up including Wellington, McKrieth, Baptiste, Maunick and Hinds and played some dates in the UK.

Although no original members are involved, Bello and Augustin who replaced Etienne and Maunick in the band perform as Light of the World, with a new line up of musicians including drummer Mel Gaynor of the rock group Simple Minds who had played some tracks on the album \'Round Trip\' years earlier. Nat Augustin also appears with a group called Sing Baby Sing a highly rated tribute to The Stylistics as well as a popular tribute to George Benson on the UK cabaret circuit. 
Gee Bello also performs a tribute act to the singer Errol Brown of the group Hot Chocolate. In 2007 Beggar & Co released a new CD, \'Brass, Strings N\' Things\' under the collective name of Beggar & Co featuring The Funk Jazz Collective. This was a live recording from The Jazz Cafe with an additional studio recording \'Coming Home To See My Baby\' a cover version of The Fatback Band recording from the 70\'s.

Beggar & Co have released two CD\'s since 2010, The Legacy and Sleeping Giants. Both CD\'S appeared in the American genre charts with Sleeping Giants proving the most popular, peaking at No.19 in the Amazon Classic R&B charts. Both The Legacy and Brass, Strings n \'Things entered the Amazon Avant Garde charts in North America. In 2006 EMI records issued the CD \'Anthology: Addicted To Funk\' which featured tracks by Light of the World, Beggar & Co, Incognito and The Team as well as some previously unreleased material.


The album\' Round Trip\'+ bonus tracks was also issued for the first time on CD in 2008 by EMI records and accredited to Light of the World + Beggar & Co featuring The Funk Jazz Collective.<ref name="Myspace.com/lightoftheworldmusic"/><ref name="Myspace.com/beggarandco"/>

==Benefit concert==
Founder member, Paul \'Tubbs\' Williams died in early 2007, and a benefit concert was held for him at [[Dingwalls]] in [[Camden Town|Camden]]. This show featured all the original members back on stage, along with guests including [[Junior Giscombe]], [[Kenny Thomas (singer)|Kenny Thomas]] and Leee John formerly of Imagination.

\'\'\'Los Amigos Invisibles\'\'\' is a [[Venezuela]]n band that plays a blend of [[disco]], [[acid jazz]] and [[funk]] mixed with Latin rhythms.  In addition to releasing six critically acclaimed albums, the band is lauded internationally for their explosive, live shows, spanning nearly 60 countries.

==History==
In 1995, EMI released their debut album, \'\'A Typical and Autoctonal Venezuelan Dance Band\'\', which was a huge success in their home country, enabling them to sell out clubs around Caracas for the next couple of years.  In 1996, [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]]\'s [[Luaka Bop]] [[recording label|record label]] signed the group after discovering a CD they had planted in a New York City record store.  Shortly thereafter, they went into the studio to work on their sophomore record, \'\'The New Sound of the Venezuelan Gozadera\'\', which was released in 1998 and received accolades from press and musicians alike.  Two years later and under the direction of famed producer [[Philip Steir]], they released \'\'Arepa 3000: A Venezuelan Journey into Space\'\', which received a [[Grammy]] nomination in the category of "Best Latin Alternative Album" and a [[Latin Grammy]] in the category of "Best Rock Album."  Following the success of this release, the band relocated to [[New York City]] and began work on their masterpiece, \'\'[[The Venezuelan Zinga Son, Vol. 1]]\'\', produced by [["Little" Louie Vega]] of [[Masters at Work]]. Initially, the album was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and Japan through Long Lost Brothers Records, though a year later, Luaka Bop released the album in the [[United States|US]], resulting in another Latin Grammy nomination in the category of "Best Alternative Latin Album."

After ending their [[recording contract]] with Luaka Bop, Los Amigos Invisibles started their own label, Gozadera Records.  The first release, \'\'Chill Out Venezuela\'\', was a multiple-genre collection of Venezuelan artists, produced by Los Amigos Invisibles.  For Gozadera\'s next release and the band\'s fifth studio album, they enlisted [[Dimitri from Paris]] to produce a collection of Venezuelan cover songs entitled, \'\'[[Super Pop Venezuela]]\'\', which was initially offered in their native country only.  In 2006, the album was released in the US, landing the band yet another Grammy nomination in the category of "Best Urban Latin Alternative Album."

After three years of anticipation, Los Amigos Invisibles released their album, \'\'[[Commercial (album)|Commercial]]\'\', in a joint effort between Gozadera Records and [[Nacional Records]].  In an interview with America\'s [[National Public Radio]], the band explained that the change in style was not by accident, nor was decision to name the latest project \'\'Commercial\'\'. Rather, it is a tongue-in-cheek reference to band\'s former musical self.  The release was a  hit in Venezuela, debuting at #1 on the music charts.  During the week of July 7, 2009, their song, "Vivire Para Ti" featuring [[Natalia Lafourcade]], was offered as Single of the Week in the [[iTunes]] music store and in November 2009, \'\'Commercial\'\' won the Latin Grammy in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]].

Following their [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] win, 2010 saw festival appearances and shows throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

In 2011, the band released \'\'Not So Commercial\'\', an [[Extended Play|EP]] of outtakes from the \'\'Commercial\'\' album. This album was a nominee for the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album]] in 2012.

In April 2013, \'\'Repeat After Me\'\' was released.<ref name="allmusic1">{{cite web|last=Jurek |first=Thom |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/repeat-after-me-mw0002489802 |title=Repeat After Me - Los Amigos Invisibles : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-05-12}}</ref> This album received a [[Grammy]] nomination in the category of "Best Latin Alternative Album" and a [[Latin Grammy]] in the category of "Best Alternative Album", "Song of the year" and "Best Cover".

In 2014, "Ac\xc3\xbastico" is about to be released. A greatest hits on acustic format.

Also in 2014, Armando Figueredo and Jose Luis Pardo left the band.

 ****** Mass Production (band)

b'{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
\'\'\'Mass Production\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[funk music|funk]]/[[disco]] [[band (music)|musical group]], best known for their 1979 [[hit record|hit]], "[[Firecracker (Mass Production song)|Firecracker]]."  Based in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], the ten-piece group had a series of minor [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  "Firecracker" is commonly misattributed to the similarly named (and sonically/stylistically similar) band [[Brass Construction]].

The band consisted of Kevin "D\'No" Douglas ([[bass guitar|bass]] and [[vocals]]), James "Otiste" Drumgole ([[trumpet]], [[flugelhorn]], and vocals), Agnes "Tiny" Kelly ([[lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[vocoder]]; later replaced by Dee (DeeDee) Henderson), Larry Marshall (lead vocals, [[percussion]]<ref>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Mass%20Production.html Mass Production bio @soulwalking.co.uk] Accessed 1-10-2010</ref>), Gregory McCoy ([[saxophone]]), Emmanuel Redding (percussion), Ricardo Williams (lead vocals, [[drum kit|drums]], percussion), Tyrone Williams (keyboards), Rodney Phelps ([[lead guitar]], keyboards) and LeCoy Bryant ([[rhythm guitar]], vocals).<ref>[http://www.70disco.com/masspro.htm More Extensive Band Biography] Accessed 1-10-2010</ref>  Phelps left the band prior to the recording of their 1980 \'\'Massterpiece\'\' album, leaving Bryant to handle all guitar duties. Phelps was later replaced by Dan Harris ([[lead guitar]]). [[Dan Harris (guitarist)|Dan Harris]] toured with the group as a freelance guitarist for a couple of years then left the band to work as a recording session musician.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Mass-Production-Massterpiece/release/935833 Mass Production- \'\'Massterpiece\'\' @Discogs.com] Retrieved 1-7-2012.</ref>  The band would soon expand back to ten, with Samuel Williams joining on drums in the early 1980s, allowing Ricardo Williams to concentrate more on vocals.

In addition to "Firecracker," which hit number four on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] in the late summer of 1979, other hits by the band include "Cosmic Lust", "Groove Me", and "Shante." The group stayed together for several more years, scoring a string of small hits, before deciding to disband in 1983.

"Firecracker" was [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by [[2 Live Crew]] for their 1989 hit [[single (music)|single]] "[[Me So Horny]]", from their [[album]] \'\'[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]]\'\'.

In 1978, having received a substantial royalty payment for his work with [[The Yardbirds]], Russian music entrepreneur [[Giorgio Gomelsky]] relocated to [[New York]] in an attempt to open up the American market to the European progressive jazz-rock bands he was working with, such as [[Gong (band)|Gong]], [[Henry Cow]] and [[Magma (band)|Magma]]. He established the Zu Club in [[Manhattan]] and after meeting 24-year-old bass player [[Bill Laswell]], encouraged him to form a band. Three young friends, [[Michael Beinhorn]] (17, synthesizer), [[Martin Bisi]] (17, engineering) and [[Fred Maher]] (14, drums), responded to Laswell\'s advert in \'\'[[The Village Voice]]\'\' and the band began rehearsing in the club\'s basement.<ref name="Perfect Sound Bisi Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/martinbisi.html |title=Martin Bisi interview |publisher=Furious.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref>

The band became known as the "Zu Band" until Gomelsky hooked them up with former [[Gong (band)|Gong]] frontman [[Daevid Allen]] for a performance at his Zu Manifestival at the Zu Club on October 8, 1978, for which they became "New York Gong". Guitarist [[Cliff Cultreri]], who was replaced by guitarist Michael Lawrence for the Manifestival before returning, and second drummer [[Bill Bacon]] joined them for a Spring 1979 tour of the USA in an old school bus playing most of Gong\'s Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy.[Don Davis on saxophone.] In autumn, they recorded the album \'\'[[About Time (New York Gong album)|About Time]]\'\'.<ref>[http://planetgong.co.uk/maze/blurbs/daevid2.shtml ]{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref> Allen and the band amicably parted company when they "discovered they couldn\'t stand the European way of life" during a tour of France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calyx.club.fr/bands/related.html |title=The Extended Family |publisher=Calyx.club.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}</ref>

The band then took the name Material, from the Laswell/Cultreri composed instrumental "Materialism" on the \'\'About Time\'\' album. Their debut recording was 1979\'s instrumental [[post-punk]] [[industrial music|industrial]] [[funk]] \'\'[[Temporary Music|Temporary Music 1]]\'\' EP for Gomelsky\'s Zu Records. The band then signed to [[Celluloid Records]], and the single "Discourse" was issued in 1980. 

They were reduced back to the trio of Beinhorn, Laswell and Maher for the 1981 EP \'\'[[Temporary Music|Temporary Music 2]]\'\'(included Don Davis on Saxophone,"White Man"). Their first full album, \'\'[[Memory Serves]]\'\', which featured strong jazz leanings, had contributions from guitarists [[Sonny Sharrock]] and Henry Cow\'s [[Fred Frith]], cornetist [[Olu Dara]], saxophonist [[Henry Threadgill]] and violinist [[Billy Bang]].

They started working with singers and their music became more melodic and funkier. Their next single "Ciquiri" (included on the \'\'[[American Songs]]\'\' EP) which featured guitarist [[Robert Quine]], became popular in New York City dance clubs. The 1981 "[[Bustin\' Out (song)|Bustin\' Out]]" single was released as an extended club mix peaking at number two on the dance charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\xe2\x80\x932003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=169}}</ref> On "Busting Out", they were fronted by singer [[Nona Hendryx]] with support from guitarist Ronnie Drayton. This line-up also recorded "It\'s a Holiday" for a split single with Cristina.

By 1982\'s \'\'[[One Down]]\'\', drummer Maher had left the band, and they embraced a multitude of singers including [[Nona Hendryx]], [[B.J. Nelson]], [[Bernard Fowler|R. Bernard Fowler]] and [[Whitney Houston]] in one of her first lead singer recordings. Houston\'s vocal was on a cover version of [[Hugh Hopper]]\'s "Memories", which also featured a lead break by saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]]. Critic Robert Christgau of \'\'[[The Village Voice]]\'\' called her contribution "one of the most gorgeous ballads you\'ve ever heard".<ref>{{cite web  | last = Christgau |first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Christgau |title = Material she was a great song writer|publisher = RobertChristgau.com | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Material|accessdate = 2007-12-12}}</ref> As an indication of the direction the band headed for, [[Chic (band)|Chic]]\'s guitarist [[Nile Rodgers]] was involved alongside Frith and Drayton, but perhaps more significantly, was one of the first appearances of longtime Laswell collaborator [[Nicky Skopelitis]].

===1982\xe2\x80\x9389: Collaborations===
Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn settled into a duo and began working with other musicians, producing, writing and performing, with [[Martin Bisi]] continuing occasionally as the engineer. They worked initially in the electro genre, but quickly moved into the fields of [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[Rapping|rap]], collaborating with [[turntablist]] [[Grand Mixer DXT|D.St]] and rappers [[PHASE 2]] and [[Fab Five Freddy]]. 

A chance meeting between Laswell and [[Herbie Hancock]] at [[Elektra Records]], in which the latter expressed interest in making music in the vein of [[Malcolm McLaren]]\'s "Buffalo Gals" lead to a collaboration that brought forth the \'\'[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]\'\' album and the hit single "[[Rockit]]".<ref name="Perfect Sound Bisi Interview" /> They would collaborate with Hancock on two further albums released under his name, 1984\'s \'\'[[Sound-System (album)|Sound-System]]\'\' and 1988\'s \'\'[[Perfect Machine]]\'\'. Hancock himself would go on to contribute to many of Material and Laswell\'s projects.

In 1984, under the name [[Time Zone (band)|Timezone]], they released the single "World Destruction" which featured [[disc jockey]] [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[John Lydon]] (former singer of the [[Sex Pistols]]).

In 1985 Laswell and Beinhorn parted company. Beinhorn went into record production for the likes of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]. Laswell retained the Material name and was calling upon a large group of musicians with, at its core, guitarist [[Nicky Skopelitis]], keyboardist [[Jeff Bova]], percussionist [[Aiyb Dieng]], former [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] and bassist [[Bootsy Collins]], plus Jamaican reggae duo [[Sly Dunbar]] and [[Robbie Shakespeare]] ([[Sly and Robbie]]).

===1989\xe2\x80\x9399: Projects===
By 1989, Laswell had ceased using the Material name as an umbrella for his own activities and began to use it as a front for specific projects. The first of these projects was the album \'\'[[Seven Souls]]\'\', featuring [[William S. Burroughs]] reading portions of his novel \'\'[[The Western Lands]]\'\'. In 1998, the album was subject to a series of re-mixes by Laswell, [[Talvin Singh]], [[Spring Heel Jack]], [[DJ Olive]] and released as \'\'[[Seven Souls#The Road to the Western Lands|The Road to the Western Lands]]\'\'.

\'\'[[The Third Power]]\'\' was released in 1991, with duo [[Sly and Robbie]] and Bootsy Collins being Laswell\'s main collaborators. Vocal performances were given by the [[Jungle Brothers]]\' Baby Bam and Mike G, [[The Last Poets]]\'s [[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin|Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin]], and [[Shabba Ranks]]. Other musicians included members of [[Funkadelic]], Herbie Hancock, [[Henry Threadgill]] and [[Olu Dara]].

1993\'s \'\'[[Hallucination Engine]]\'\' was a fusion of jazz, Indian and Middle Eastern influences. Noted jazz players included [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Jonas Hellborg]], and from [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin\'s]] [[Shakti (band)|Shakti]] tabla player [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], violinist [[L. Shankar]] and [[Thetakudi Harihara Vinayakram|Vikku Vinayakram]] (on [[ghatam]]). Palestinian violinist [[Simon Shaheen]], Indian percussionist [[Trilok Gurtu]], and [[William S. Burroughs]]  also contributed. [[Mantra (Material song)|"Mantra"]], an 8 minute track from the album, was given a 17 minute remix by [[The Orb]] for the 12" single.

The final release under the name Material was 1999\'s \'\'[[Intonarumori (album)|Intonarumori]]\'\'. Sub-titled "Rap is still an art", it featured contributions from [[Rammellzee]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Flavor Flav]] and [[Killah Priest]].

Laswell has on occasion used the name for live performances, the last being at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] on June 13, 2004 with, among others, his wife [[Gigi (singer)|Gigi]], drummer [[Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] and guitarist [[Buckethead]] (both from Laswell\'s other project, [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]]).<ref>[http://www.bonnaroo.com/artists/material.aspx ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

\'\'\'Maze\'\'\' are an American [[Soul music|soul]] / [[quiet storm]] [[musical ensemble|band]], also known alternately as \'\'\'Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly\'\'\' and \'\'\'Maze & Frankie Beverly\'\'\', was established in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in the early 1970s.

==Career==
[[Frankie Beverly]] started the group as Raw Soul in 1970. They recorded a couple of [[single (music)|singles]] on the small Gregar [[record label|label]], but without any major [[hit record|hits]]. With a few personnel changes, a relocation from Philadelphia to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in California in 1971, and an introduction to [[Marvin Gaye]], the group became an immediate success. Gaye took the group on the road with him as one of his opening acts, and in 1976, he suggested that they changed their name from Raw Soul to Maze.

Maze signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Capitol Records]] in 1976, and released their debut album, [[Maze featuring Frankie Beverly (album)|\'\'Maze featuring Frankie Beverly\'\']], in 1977.  From that album, the hit singles included "Happy Feelin\'s", "While I\'m Alone", and "Lady of Magic", ultimately giving them their first [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] and earning Maze a devoted following. They also had success with the albums \'\'Golden Time of Day\'\' (1978), \'\'Inspiration\'\' (1979) and \'\'Joy and Pain\'\' (1980).

Their next [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] was \'\'Live in New Orleans,\'\' three quarters of which was recorded at the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Saenger Theatre]], on November 14\xe2\x80\x9315, 1980. Three of those songs got into the [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]], including "Running Away", "[[Before I Let Go]]", and "We Need Love To Live". By that time, the band had both a reputation in [[United States|America]] and also enjoyed a following in the [[United Kingdom]] with promotional support from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Robbie Vincent]]. In May 1985, Maze sold out eight nights at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years">{{cite book

| id= CN 5585}}</ref>

The group released their next album, \'\'Can\'t Stop the Love\'\' in March 1985, which featured the group\'s first number one R&B hit "Back In Stride." The [[Top 40|Top 5]] follow-up, "Too Many Games" was also featured on this album.  The latter single also became the band\'s biggest hit in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], where it peaked at number 36 on the charts.

In 1989, they signed with Warner Bros. and released the hit album \'\'Silky Soul\'\', plus \'\'Back to Basics\'\' in 1993, and released the [[live album|live]] [[DVD]] recording at [[London]]\'s [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1994. The two albums also attained gold disc status. They had another number one R&B success with "Can\'t Get Over You".

In October 2004, "Twilight" appeared in the [[video game]], \'\'[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]\'\', playing on funk radio station,  [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack#Bounce FM|Bounce FM]] .

In 2009, a tribute to the hits of Maze was released. Called \'\'Silky Soul Music: An All Star Tribute to Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly,\'\' it included modern stars performing Maze\'s biggest hits with Maze acting as the backing band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/maze.htm |title=Maze featuring Frankie Beverly &#124; SoulTracks - Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |publisher=SoulTracks |date= |accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>

On September 2, 2011, their percussionist and background singer, McKinley "Bug" Williams, died of an apparent [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at a hotel in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

Maze continues to tour around the United States as well as [[Europe]] to this day. Every year they are the closing act for the [[Essence Music Festival]].

\'\'\'Medeski Martin & Wood\'\'\' (or \'\'\'MMW\'\'\') is an [[United States|American]] [[avant-jazz|avant]]-[[jazz-funk]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] formed in 1991, consisting of [[John Medeski]] on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[piano]], [[Billy Martin (percussionist)|Billy Martin]] on [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], and [[Chris Wood (jazz musician)|Chris Wood]] on [[double bass]] and [[bass guitar]]. 

The band draws on influences from a number of musical traditions, from [[funk]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and is known for an unconventional style sometimes described as "[[avant-jazz|avant]]-[[Groove (music)|groove]]".

MMW has found moderate mainstream success, often working with noted guitarist [[John Scofield]] and touring on the [[jam band]] circuit.

==History==
The band members were introduced to each other by jazz drummer [[Bob Moses (musician)|Bob Moses]], who had performed with Medeski and Wood, and was Martin\'s instructor. 

Medeski Martin & Wood\'s first performances together were at the [[Village Gate]], a popular New York jazz club. They were initially an acoustic jazz trio, but Medeski added a [[Hammond organ]] when the difficulties of touring with a piano became apparent{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. Their first album, \'\'[[Notes from the Underground (Medeski Martin & Wood album)|Notes from the Underground]]\'\', is a record of their entirely-acoustic era. All of their subsequent albums reveal Medeski\'s use of a wide variety of keyboards, including [[mellotron]], [[melodica]], and a [[clavinet]]. Wood entirely eschewed the electric bass for MMW\'s first three albums, and still relies heavily on the acoustic upright bass in recordings and during live performances. Their earlier albums reveal a [[Hip hop music|Hip Hop]] influenced updating of classic [[soul jazz]] sounds, which is the primary theme of their well-known 1996 album, \'\'[[Shack-man]]\'\'. 

The band received some of their first significant exposure outside of the [[New York City]] jazz scene by performing with [[Phish]] at their October 14, 1995 concert, which led to the association of the group as a [[jam band]].<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/medeskimartinandwood]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> In addition, their performance on [[John Scofield]]\'s 1997 album \'\'[[A Go Go (John Scofield album)|A Go Go]]\'\' helped to further their exposure.  The band collaborated further with Scofield again in 2006, releasing the album \'\'[[Out Louder]]\'\' under the name Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood.  This was the first album released on MMW\'s own [[Indirecto Records]].

From 1998 to 2005, MMW were signed to leading jazz label [[Blue Note Records]], and showed them delving deeper into dense, electronic funk than their earlier albums, although the band continued to experiment with [[free jazz]] and [[free improvisation]] both on their albums and in concert. In 2001 MMW performed several songs for the [[Red Hot Organization]]\'s compilation album \'\'[[Red Hot + Indigo]]\'\', a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]], which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing [[AIDS]] awareness and fighting the disease. 

Medeski Martin & Wood\'s live performances are renowned for their exploratory nature. Their concerts usually involve extended improvisations, which may be both arrhythmic and [[atonality|atonal]], an aspect of their musicianship that is rarely documented in the studio. They occasionally tour using only acoustic instruments, reverting to the instrumentation that they began their career with. Their album \'\'[[Tonic (Medeski Martin & Wood album)|Tonic]]\'\' is an example of these more contemporary acoustic performances. They have also done short tours of entirely improvisatory performances. These shows usually consisted of two sets of improvisation, followed by an encore of a song from an album.

==Side projects==
Each of the trio\'s three members is involved in a large music community, and has participated in numerous side projects over the years.  

In 2001 John Medeski collaborated with the [[North Mississippi Allstars]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]]; together, these five musicians formed [[The Word (band)|The Word]], a [[blues]]y [[gospel music|gospel]] [[instrumental]] [[jam band]]. They released one self-titled album and toured extensively.

Beginning around 2005 Chris Wood formed [[The Wood Brothers]] with his brother, blues guitarist Oliver Wood. They have released several albums to date and continue to tour and record together. 

In 2007 John Medeski and Billy Martin released an album as a duo, called \'\'[[Mago (album)|Mago]]\'\'. They performed that material together at the 2007 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]].<ref>[http://www.bonnaroo.com/2007-lineup ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

 ****** Mickey %26 the Soul Generation

b'\'\'\'Mickey & the Soul Generation\'\'\' were a [[funk]] band from [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. The group formed in the late 1960s in the midst of the Texas funk scene, which consisted mostly of locally and regionally known bands but which was extraordinarily prolific (and known today mostly through [[hip hop]] [[sample (music)|sampling]] and [[reissue]]s on labels such as Jazzman Records).

==History==
Mickey Foster and Emil Carter first played together in a Latino soul group called The Royal Tokens. The two split from the group to form a new band; picking up George Salas and Gilbert Rivera, they called themselves "The Fabulous Four". After further lineup changes, the group became "The Fabulous Five", "Mickey and the Fabulous Five" and lastly "Mickey and the Soul Generation". The group won several local talent shows and began recording in a local [[Tejano music|Tejano]] studio. Their 1969 single, "Iron Leg", was picked up for distribution nationwide by [[Maxwell Records]], a [[New York]] label, and the 45 sold well regionally in [[Florida]], [[California]], and [[Texas]]. At the height of its popularity, it was used in a segment by [[Nipsey Russell]] on a routine he did for [[The Tonight Show]].<ref name=davis>[[DJ Shadow|Josh Davis]]. Liner Notes, \'\'Iron Leg\'\'. Cali-Tex, 2002, \'\'passim\'\'.</ref>

After the release of a second single, "Football", the group went on tour, opening for [[Sam & Dave]], [[The Supremes]], [[Clarence Carter]], and [[Kool & the Gang]] in the American South and Midwest. After moving to New York to fill an opening slot for fellow Maxwell artists [[Faith, Hope & Charity]], the group split with its label over monetary disputes and returned to Texas. Further recording ensued at local studios, but the group soon splintered, recording its last singles in 1973.<ref name=davis/>

Mickey & the Soul Generation saw little widespread success while active as a band. However, the group became better known when Josh Davis ([[DJ Shadow]]) began interpolating their music into his records and mixes. Davis, who called the group his \'favorite funk band\',<ref name=davis/> collected the group\'s recordings and had them reissued on [[Cali-Tex]] records in 2002 in the double [[long play|LP]] and [[double CD]] formats. The reissue, \'\'Iron Leg\'\', won highly positive reviews from many press outlets.<ref>[http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid=oid%3A14582 Album Review]. \'\'[[Sacramento News & Review]]\'\', March 20, 2003.

\'\'\'Midnight Star\'\'\' is an American [[musical ensemble|group]] that had a string of [[Hit record|hits]] in the 1980s.

==Band history==
The group was formed in 1976 at [[Kentucky State University]] by trumpeter Reggie Calloway, vocalist Belinda Lipscomb, guitarist/drummer/vocalist Melvin Gentry, bassist Kenneth Gant, multi-instrumentalist Bill Simmons, keyboard player/vocalist Bo Watson and guitarist/keyboardist Jeff Cooper, as a self-contained group. They would later add non-KSU student trombonist Vincent Calloway (Reginald\'s younger brother). A 1978 New York City showcase inspired [[SOLAR Records]] chief [[Dick Griffey]] to sign the group. They released their debut album \'\'The Beginning\'\' (1980) with some guest [[recording studio|studio]] [[session musician|musicians]].  In 1981 their second album, released on Solar Records, \'\'Standing Together,\'\' reached position #54 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]]. In 1982 they released a third album, \'\'Victory\'\'.
 
Utilizing elected band leader Reggie Calloway\'s production skills, it did not take long for Midnight Star to hit the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]]  chart with early [[single (music)|singles]] like "Hot Spot" and "I\'ve Been Watching You".  Drummer Bobby Lovelace joined the group in late 1982, freeing Gentry to sing and play guitar exclusively.  Their fourth album, \'\'[[No Parking on the Dance Floor]]\'\', was released in 1983, and it took them to the top of the charts with the first single, "Freak-A-Zoid", which went to number two.  Other singles from the album included "Wet My Whistle", and the title track. These singles, along with the hit album tracks "Slow Jam" (co-written by [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]]) and "Electricity"  propelled the album to double platinum status.  Their next album, \'\'[[Planetary Invasion]]\'\', was almost as big, selling platinum again and making the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop]] Top 20 and the number one spot on the R&B chart with its first single, "[[Operator (Midnight Star song)|Operator]]".  This song remains the band\'s only [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] [[Top 40]] hit to date.

In 1986 they released their sixth album, \'\'Headlines\'\', which was their third album to sell at least gold.  It was to be their last with the Calloway brothers. Due to irreconcilable differences with the other members, Reggie was out of the group and Vincent left shortly thereafter.  They achieved their biggest success in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] with "Midas Touch", which made #8, and "Headlines", a #16 hit earlier the same year.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

These two albums proved not as successful as their previous three release, but did bear fruit with Top Ten R&B singles such as: "Don\'t Rock The Boat" and "Snake In The Grass". The group went on a long hiatus, though they never officially broke up.

The group reunited in 2000 with many of the original members (including all of the singers) and released the album \'\'15th Avenue\'\' two years later.  Since then, the group has [[concert tour|toured]] sporadically, most recently with a lineup that includes Belinda Lipscomb, Kenneth Gant, Melvin Gentry, Bo Watson, and Bobby Lovelace, with Bill Simmons sometimes joining as well.

==Outside work==
Outside of Midnight Star, a few band members have contributed to other projects. Bo Watson co-wrote a few songs for singer [[Toni Braxton]]. He co-wrote the [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] duet "Give U My Heart" and "Love Shoulda Brought You Home" from the \'\'[[Boomerang (soundtrack)|Boomerang]]\'\' soundtrack<ref>{{cite web|title=Various \xe2\x80\x93 Boomerang: Original Soundtrack Album|url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Boomerang-Original-Soundtrack-Album/release/1810821|website=discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2014-12-21}}</ref> as well as the song "Spending My Time With You" on Braxton\'s [[Toni Braxton (album)|self-titled debut]]. Watson also helped write other songs such as "Turn Down the Lights" for [[Shanice]], "Rock Steady" for [[The Whispers]] and "Meeting in the Ladies\' Room" for [[Klymaxx]].

Reggie and Vincent Calloway went on to produce such acts as [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[The Deele]] and [[LeVert]]- the latter with whom they would have their biggest success with the song "Casanova".

Belinda Lipscomb appears on [[Reflection Eternal]]\'s 2010 album \'\'[[Revolutions per Minute (Reflection Eternal album)|Revolutions Per Minute]]\'\' on the album track "Long Hot Summer" as well as the second single "In This World".<ref>{{cite web|title=Talib Kweli + Hi-Tek Are Reflection Eternal \xe2\x80\x93 Revolutions Per Minute|url=http://www.discogs.com/Talib-Kweli-Hi-Tek-Are-Reflection-Eternal-Revolutions-Per-Minute/release/2285240|website=discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=2014-12-21}}</ref> Lipscomb would also contribute additional background vocals on "Toyz N Da Hood" from [[Snoop Dogg]]\'s 2011 album \'\'[[Doggumentary]]\'\'.<ref>Snoop Dogg- Doggumentary (CD liner notes).

\'\'\'Marcus Miller\'\'\' (born \'\'\'William Henry Marcus Miller, Jr.\'\'\'; June 14, 1959) is an American [[jazz]] composer, producer and [[multi-instrumentalist]], best known as a [[bass guitar]]ist. Throughout his career, Miller worked with trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], singer [[Luther Vandross]], and saxophonist [[David Sanborn]], as well as maintaining a successful solo career. Miller is classically trained as a [[clarinet]]ist and also plays [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[saxophone]] and [[guitar]].

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Miller was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, in 1959 and raised in a musical family that includes his father, William Miller (a church organist and choir director) and jazz pianist [[Wynton Kelly]]. By 13, Marcus was proficient on clarinet, piano and bass guitar, and already writing songs. Two years later he was working regularly in New York City, eventually playing bass and writing music for jazz flutist [[Bobbi Humphrey]] and keyboardist [[Lonnie Liston Smith]]. Miller soon became a first call session musician, appearing on over 500 albums by such artists as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[McCoy Tyner]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[George Benson]], [[Dr. John]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Elton John]], [[Grover Washington, Jr.]], [[Donald Fagen]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[LL Cool J]] and [[Flavio Sala]].

===Professional career===
[[Image:MarcusMillerParadiso.jpg|thumb|170px|Miller at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] in Amsterdam, 2007]]
Miller spent approximately 15&nbsp;years performing as a [[sideman]] or [[session musician]], observing how band leaders operated. During that time he also did a lot of arranging and producing. He was a member of the \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' band 1978-1979. He wrote the intro to Aretha Franklin\'s "I Wanna Make It Up To You". He has played bass on over 500 recordings including those of Luther Vandross, Grover Washington Jr., [[Roberta Flack]], [[Carly Simon]], McCoy Tyner, [[Bryan Ferry]] and [[Billy Idol]].  He won the "Most Valuable Player" award, (awarded by [[NARAS]] to recognize studio musicians) three years in a row and was subsequently awarded "player emeritus" status and retired from eligibility. In the nineties, Miller began to make his own records, putting a band together to take advantage of touring opportunities.

Between 1988 and 1990 he appeared in the first season and again toward the end as both the musical director and also as the house band bass player in the Sunday Night Band during the two seasons of the acclaimed music performance program \'\'[[Sunday Night (American TV program)|Sunday Night]]\'\' on [[NBC]] late-night television.<ref>\'\'Sunday Night\'\' episodes No.&nbsp;104 (1988), No.&nbsp;121 (1989)</ref>

As a composer, Miller wrote all but two of the songs on \'\'[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]\'\' for Miles Davis, including its title track &ndash; a piece that defined Davis\'s career in the late 1980s. He also composed "Chicago Song" for [[David Sanborn]] and co-wrote "[[\'Til My Baby Comes Home]]", "[[It\'s Over Now (Luther Vandross song)|It\'s Over Now]]", "[[For You to Love]]", and "[[Power of Love/Love Power|Power of Love]]" for Luther Vandross.  Miller also wrote "[[Da Butt]]", which was featured in [[Spike Lee]]\'s \'\'[[School Daze]]\'\'.

Miller currently has [[bandleader|his own band]]. In 1997 he played bass guitar and bass clarinet in a band called Legends, featuring [[Eric Clapton]] (guitars and vocals), [[Joe Sample]] (piano), David Sanborn (alto sax) and [[Steve Gadd]] (drums). It was an 11-date tour of major jazz festivals in Europe.

On Sunday November 25, 2012, Miller\'s tour bus crashed in Switzerland, en route to [[Monte Carlo]]. The driver was killed, but Miller, ten members of his band, and another driver sustained no life-threatening injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474030/bassist-marcus-miller-injured-in-fatal-bus-crash |title=Bassist Marcus Miller Injured in Fatal Bus Crash |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2014-05-19}}</ref>

In addition to his recording and performance career, Miller has established a parallel career as a [[film score]] composer ([[Marcus Miller#Film scores|see listing below]]), having written numerous scores for films.<ref>See also interview on ABC Radio National Music Show with Andrew Ford Nov 2010</ref>

===Awards and recognition===

==Instruments==

Later, Fender moved the production of the 4-string to their Mexico factory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0257802321 |title=Fender,com |publisher=Fender.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}} {{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref> and discontinued both 4 and 5-string models in 2015. DR Strings also produced a series of Marcus Miller signature stainless steel strings known as "Fat Beams," which come in a variety of sizes.<ref>[http://www.drstrings.com/#!fat-beams/c1k2b Marcus Miller Fat Beams at Drstrings.com.] Retrieved 23 November 2014.</ref> As of 2015, Dunlop has began producing Marcus Miller Super Bright bass strings which Miller has switched to.<ref>[http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/marcus-miller-super-bright Marcus Miller Super Bright Strings and Dunlop.com] Retrieved 26 March 2015.</ref>

\'\'\'Richard Allen\'\'\' "\'\'\'Blue\'\'\'" \'\'\'Mitchell\'\'\' (March 13, 1930 \xe2\x80\x93 May 21, 1979) was an American [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], soul, rock, and [[funk]] trumpeter, known for many albums recorded as leader and sideman for [[Riverside Records|Riverside]], [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] and then [[Mainstream Records]].<ref name=ALLMUSIC>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p7140/biography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Biography]</ref>

==Biography==
Mitchell was born and raised in [[Miami, Florida]]. He began playing trumpet in high school, where he acquired his nickname, Blue.<ref name="ALLMUSIC"/>

After high school he played in the rhythm and blues ensembles of [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]], [[Earl Bostic]], and [[Chuck Willis]]. After returning to Miami he was noticed by [[Julian Cannonball Adderley|Cannonball Adderley]], with whom he recorded for [[Riverside Records]] in New York in 1958.

He then joined the [[Horace Silver]] Quintet, playing with tenor saxophonist [[Junior Cook]], bassist [[Gene Taylor (bassist)|Gene Taylor]] and drummer [[Roy Brooks]]. Mitchell stayed with Silver\'s group until the band\'s break-up in 1964, after which he formed a group with members from the Silver quintet, substituting the young pianist [[Chick Corea]] for Silver and replacing Brooks, who had fallen ill, with drummer [[Al Foster]]. This group produced a number of records for [[Blue Note]]. It disbanded in 1969, after which Mitchell joined and toured with [[Ray Charles]] until 1971.

From 1971 to 1973 Mitchell performed with [[John Mayall]], appearing on \'\'[[Jazz Blues Fusion]]\'\' and subsequent albums. From the mid-70s he recorded and worked as a session man in the genres noted previously, performed with the big band leaders [[Louie Bellson]], [[Bill Holman (musician)|Bill Holman]] and [[Bill Berry (trumpeter)|Bill Berry]] and was principal soloist for [[Tony Bennett]] and [[Lena Horne]]. Other band leaders Mitchell recorded with include [[Lou Donaldson]], [[Grant Green]], [[Philly Joe Jones]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Johnny Griffin]], [[Al Cohn]], [[Dexter Gordon]] and [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]. Blue Mitchell kept his hard-bop playing going with the [[Harold Land]] quintet up until his death from cancer on May 21, 1979, in Los Angeles, at the age of 49.

\'\'\'Walter "Junie" Morrison\'\'\' is a musician and [[record producer|producer]] born in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. Morrison was a producer, writer, keyboardist and [[singing|vocalist]] for the [[funk]] band the [[Ohio Players]] in the early 70s, where he wrote and produced their first major hits, "Pain", "Pleasure", "Ecstasy" and "Funky Worm" (1971-1972). He left the band in 1974 to release three [[solo album]]s on [[Westbound Records]] (\'\'When We Do\'\', \'\'Freeze\'\', and \'\'Suzie Supergroupie\'\').

In 1977 Morrison joined [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]]\'s [[P-Funk]] ([[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]-[[Funkadelic]]) where he became musical director.  He brought a unique sound to P-Funk and played a key role during the time of their greatest popularity from 1978 through 1980. In particular, he made prominent contributions to the platinum-selling Funkadelic album \'\'[[One Nation Under a Groove]]\'\', the single "[[(Not Just) Knee Deep]]" (a #1 hit on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|U.S. R&B charts]] in 1979) and the gold-selling Parliament albums \'\'[[Motor Booty Affair]]\'\', and \'\'[[Gloryhallastoopid]]\'\'.  Morrison also played on and produced some P-Funk material under the [[pseudonym]] J.S. Theracon, apparently to avoid contractual difficulties. Morrison is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

After his time with Parliament-Funkadelic, he recorded three solo albums in the eighties including 1980\'s \'\'[[Bread Alone]]\'\', 1981\'s \'\'[[Junie 5]]\'\', and 1984\'s \'\'[[Evacuate Your Seats]]\'\'.

Morrison produced other artists throughout the [[1990s in music|90s]] and continued to contribute to P-Funk albums, most recently in 1996.

He released a new solo album, \'\'When the City\'\', on his own label Juniefunk in 2004.

==History==

===1998\xe2\x80\x932004: Founding and first albums===
The Dave Watts Motet was founded in [[Boulder, Colorado]], in 1998 by drummer and arranger Dave Watts as a musical collective with a rotating cast of musicians. By 2000 the group had changed its name to The Motet and become a sextet consisting of Watts on drums, percussionist and vocalist Jans Ingber, percussionist Scott Messersmith, guitarist Mike Tiernen, bassist Kurt Reeber, and organist-keyboardist Steve Vidiac.<ref name="allmsuicbio"/> Watts, Ingber, and Messersmith had also traveled to [[Cuba]] twice to study [[bata drums]] of the [[Santeria]] religion, which at the time heavily influenced the band\'s sound, as can be heard on their first two albums.<ref name="cohnbrain"/>

The Dave Watts Motet first performed together on Halloween 1998, and at that time were incorporating elements of funk, jazz, folk, and world music into their sound.<ref name="allmsuicbio"/> Watts wrote and arranged the majority of their early music for a rotating lineup of musicians, throwing energetic local dance parties.<ref name="motetabout"/> Their debut release, \'\'Breathe\'\', was self-released in 1999, and produced entirely by Watts.<ref name="allmsuicbio"/><ref name="breathcd"/>

The band released their second album, \'\'Play\'\', on aNOnym reCOrds in 2001, which was followed in 2002 by the album \'\'Live\'\', their first record on Harmonized Records. \'\'Music for Life\'\', released in 2004, was also on Harmonized Records.<ref name="donbreath"/> Also in 2004, the band self-released the DVD \'\'Shine\'\', which was produced by James Marshello.

===2006: \'\'Instrumental Dissent\'\'===
On September 12, 2006, they released their studio album \'\'Instrumental Dissent\'\'. While the album is largely instrumental, the voices of activists such as [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[Noam Chomsky]] are woven into many of the songs.<ref name="allmsuicinstrument"/> [[Allmusic]] gave release 3.5/5 stars and largely positive review, writing "Motet gets off to an impressive start as the opening salvo of tunes darts between funk, Afro-beat, Latin and world sounds with a slight underpinning of electronic touches, all driven by a nimble yet fiery attack." Allmusic praised the production and audio quality as well, stating "Many of the tracks blend into each other, creating a near seamless whole."<ref name="allmsuicinstrument"/> Allmusic criticized the slower pace in the latter half of the disc, stating the album "loses some of the imagination, if not steam, of the early tunes, becoming a solid yet rather conventional work from a jazz-funk fusion outfit." However, "Scott Messersmith\'s bubbling percussion and drummer Dave Watts\' elastic beats keep the heat turned up even when the tracks tend to extend longer than needed."

===2009: \'\'Dig Deep\'\'===
Around half of The Motet\'s self-released 2009 album \'\'Dig Deep\'\'<ref name="souraudio"/> features compositions written and arranged by Watts,<ref name="jambase"/> with the drummer turned producer utilizing [[Ableton Live]] to add an electronica sound to various tracks.<ref name="cohnbrain"/> Allmusic gave \'\'Dig Deep\'\' 3/5 stars, stating "Covers of three [[Fela Kuti]] tunes show that this funk-world ensemble\'s heart lies in the tough, often horn-driven Afro-beat that dominates this set." The review acknowledges the new touches of techno, stating that Watts expands the band\'s sound, "in particular toward [[Kraftwerk]]-styled techno at times, also pushing into spacy areas that will likely be a bit alienating to some longtime fans." Much of the album also relies on "percussive [[Afro-funk]]" and Allmusic pointed out elements of [[prog rock]] on tracks such as "Guru." <ref name="allmusicbeigdeep"/>

===2014: \'\'The Motet\'\' and recent projects===
They released their seventh studio album, \'\'The Motet,\'\' in February 2014. Each member of the band contributed to the writing process, with hundreds of hours spent in the studio creating vintage funk sounds.<ref name="motetabout"/> The group came up with the basic ideas for the album\'s original nine tracks in Watts\'s home studio, then recorded and mixed the album at Immersive Studios in Boulder, Colorado and Scanhope Sound in [[Littleton, Colorado]].<ref name="westwordd"/> About \'\'The Motet\'\', Watts says "The album is really like a new era for us. Writing our own music as a band, a 100 percent collaborative effort, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real stepping stone to a sound we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be bringing consistently\xe2\x80\x9d<ref name="relix"/> Writes Dave Kirby of the \'\'[[Boulder Weekly]]\'\', \xe2\x80\x9cutterly flawless production...and not a throwaway in the bunch...ambitious, airtight and built to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d  \'\'Upstate Live\'\' says that \'\'The Motet\'\'\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c55 glorious minutes showcase their growth as individuals and as an unstoppable funk machine.\xe2\x80\x9d

\'\'\'The Neville Brothers\'\'\', an [[United States|American]] [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music|soul]]/[[funk]] group, was formed in 1977 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

==History==
The group notion started in 1976, when the four brothers of the Neville family, [[Art Neville|Art]] (born 1937), Charles (b. 1938), [[Aaron Neville|Aaron]] (b. 1941), and [[Cyril Neville|Cyril]] (b. 1948) got together to take part in the recording session of [[The Wild Tchoupitoulas]], a [[Mardi Gras Indians|Mardi Gras Indian]] group led by their uncle, George Landry ("Big Chief Jolly").

[[Art Neville]] reached out to Paul Howrilla (personal manager for [[Dr. John]]) and told him that he always wanted to do something with his brothers. Paul Howrilla created Neville Productions, Inc., serving as president and CEO with all four Neville brothers as members of the board of directors. The newly formed business covered the entire Neville family, designed to protect them from the music business abuse they had previously endured in their individual careers.

This experience led them to form the group the following year. Their debut album was released from [[Capitol Records]] in 1978. It included \'\'"Bird on a Wire"\'\'. 

In 1988, the group released \'\'Uptown\'\' from [[EMI]] featuring guests including [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Carlos Santana]]. The following year saw the release of \'\'[[Yellow Moon]]\'\' from [[A&M Records]] produced by [[Daniel Lanois]]. The track "Healing Chant" from that album won best pop instrumental performance of the [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref>[http://grammys.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/ Grammy Award Winners]</ref> 

In 1990, the Neville Brothers contributed "[[In the Still of the Night (Cole Porter song)|In the Still of the Night]]" to the AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Blue]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. Also in 1990, they appeared on the bill at that year\'s [[Glastonbury Festival]].<ref name="NME Rock \'N\' Roll Years">{{cite book

Their version of \'\'"Bird on a Wire"\'\' was played over the closing credits of the 1990 [[film]], \'\'[[Bird on a Wire (film)|Bird on a Wire]]\'\'.

Due to the health problems of Art Neville, the band kept low profile in the late 1990s onto the early 2000s.  They made a comeback in 2004, however, with the album, \'\'Walkin\' In The Shadow Of Life\'\', from Back Porch Records, their first newly recorded effort in five years.

All brothers except Charles, a Massachusetts resident, had been living in New Orleans, but following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in [[2005 in music|2005]] Cyril and Aaron moved out of the city. They had not been performing in New Orleans since Katrina hit the city, however, they finally returned to perform there at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] in 2008, being given the closing spot which had been reserved for them for years.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSGOR58294620071117 Reuters:Neville Bros. return to New Orleans jazz festival]</ref><ref>[http://blog.nola.com/keithspera/2008/05/the_neville_brothers_triumphan.html nola.com:The Neville Brothers\' triumphant Jazzfest return]</ref>

Infrequently, [[Ivan Neville]], Aaron\'s son ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]) has played with the band in recent years.

\'\'\'The New Mastersounds\'\'\' are a four-piece [[jazz fusion]] and [[funk]] band from [[Leeds]], England, United Kingdom.

== History == 
In the late 1990s, guitarist and producer Eddie Roberts was running a club night in Leeds called "The Cooker." When The Cooker moved into a new venue with a second floor in 1999, there was space and the opportunity to put a live band together to complement the DJ sets. [[Simon Allen]] and Roberts had played together in 1997 as The Mastersounds, with a different bassist and no organ. Through friends and the intimate nature of the Leeds music scene, [[Pete Shand]] and [[Bob Birch]] were added on bass and Hammond respectively, establishing The New Mastersounds. Their first rehearsal produced the release for [[Blow it Hard Records]] on two limited-edition 7" singles in 2000.

As a band, and as individuals, they have since clocked up collaborations with an impressive array of musicians DJs and producers, including: [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]], [[Lou Donaldson]] ([[Blue Note]]), [[Corinne Bailey Rae]] (EMI), [[Quantic (musician)|Quantic]] (Tru Thoughts), [[Carleen Anderson]] ([[Young Disciples]] / [[Brand New Heavies]]), [[Keb Darge]] & [[Kenny Dope]] (Kay Dee Records), John Arnold (Ubiquity), [[Mr Scruff]] ([[Ninja Tuna]]), [[Snowboy]] (Ubiquity), [[Fred Everything]] (2020 vision), Andy Smith ([[Portishead (band)|Portishead]]), [[James Taylor]] ([[James Taylor Quartet]]), [[LSK]] ([[Faithless]]), and [[Karl Denson]] ([[Lenny Kravitz]]),([[Greyboy AllStars]]).

In 2006, as well as playing club gigs in France, Spain, Belgium and Italy, the band toured the USA & Japan. In August they finished recording their fifth album, 102% (released on [[One Note Records]] in 2007). The album features collaborations with sax and flute player [[Rob Lavers]] who performed as a guest with the band on several subsequent live tours. In the same year producer/guitarist Eddie Roberts had already released a live album in Japan (Roughneck \xe2\x80\x93 Live in Paris), and produced a studio album of his own arrangements of traditional Italian songs called Trenta.

2007 started auspiciously \xe2\x80\x93 on their very first Jamcruise the NMS were playing Meters tunes with [[George Porter Jr.]] sitting in \xe2\x80\x93 just one of the highlights of a 3-hour set. On their return to the United Kingdom the band were greeted by a capacity crowd at London\'s prestigious Jazz Cafe venue, for the album launch of 102%. They also performed tunes from the new album for [[Mark Lamarr]] on [[BBC Radio Two]]. At the end of January, organist Bob Birch reluctantly retired from the band due to commitments at home. In February Eddie, Simon and Pete ushered in another Leeds keyboard player, Joe Tatton, who had depped for Bob in the past, as well as working with United Kingdom soul star [[Corinne Bailey Rae]] and funk renegades The Haggis Horns. Joe\'s real initiation took place in April with the band\'s first trip to New Orleans during which they played late night at the [[House of Blues]] and the [[Blue Nile]] and where Eddie stuck around for the following week to sit in with the likes of [[Idris Muhammad]], [[Lonnie Smith]], [[Galactic]], [[Papa Mali]] and [[The Greyboy Allstars]]. Having thrilled audiences at Wakarusa, Harmony, Gratefulfest and [[High Sierra Music Festival]]s, the NMS returned to the United States at the end of July \xe2\x80\x93 to Chicago, to play [[Wicker Park (Chicago park)|Wicker Park]] and to open for [[The Headhunters]].

After a well-earned break, the NMS regrouped in October for a 2-week tour of France during which they rediscovered the joy of the original 4-piece NMS sound: bass, drums, guitar and Hammond.

On the record front, German label Legere Recordings released their compilation An Introduction to The New Mastersounds on CD and LP back in May, while Milan-based label Record Kicks was putting together an album of NMS tunes remixed by a host of talented underground funk and beats producers. "The New Mastersounds \xe2\x80\x93 Re::Mixed" was released on CD, LP and [[iTunes]] on 15 October.

As an example of the respect this band commands, Peter Wermelinger \xe2\x80\x93 deejay, collector, and author of the crate-diggers\' bible The Funky & Groovy Music Lexicon \xe2\x80\x93 places the 2001 NMS track \'Turn This Thing Around\' in his all-time top-ten tunes, along with the likes of [[Eddie Harris]], [[Funkadelic]], and [[Herbie Hancock]].

The \'\'\'Ohio Players\'\'\' were an American [[funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] band, most popular in the 1970s. They are best known for their songs "[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]" and "[[Love Rollercoaster]]". Gold certifications, records selling at least one million copies, were awarded to the singles "[[Funky Worm]]", "Skin Tight", "[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]", and "[[Love Rollercoaster]]"; plus to their albums \'\'[[Skin Tight (album)|Skin Tight]]\'\', \'\'[[Fire (Ohio Players album)|Fire]]\'\', and \'\'[[Honey (Ohio Players album)|Honey]]\'\'. On August 17, 2013, The Ohio Players were inducted into the inaugural class of the Official R&B Music Hall of Fame that took place at Cleveland State University in Cleveland, Ohio.

== History ==
The band formed in [[Dayton, Ohio]] in 1959 as the Ohio Untouchables and initially included members [[Robert Ward (blues musician)|Robert Ward]] (vocals/guitar), Marshall "Rock" Jones (bass), Clarence "Satch" Satchell (saxophone/guitar), Cornelius Johnson (drums), and Ralph "Pee Wee" Middlebrooks (trumpet/trombone). They were best known at the time as a backing group for [[The Falcons]].<ref name=McGinn/>

Ward had proved to be an unreliable leader, who would sometimes, during gigs, walk off the stage, forcing the group to stop playing. Eventually, the group vowed to keep playing even after he left. Ward and Jones got into a fistfight in 1964, after which the group broke up.<ref name="Unsung">{{cite news|work=Unsung|title=Season 4/Episode 31- \'The Story of The Ohio Players\'|date=July 4, 2011|url=http://www.soultracks.com/unsung-ohio-players}}</ref>

Ward found new backups, and the group\'s core members returned to Dayton. They replaced Ward with 21-year-old [[Leroy "Sugarfoot" Bonner]] (guitar),  who would become the group\'s front man, and added Gregory Webster (drums).<ref name=McGinn/><ref name="Unsung"/> To accommodate Bonner\'s musical style preferences for the group ("R&B with a little flair to it") and to avoid competing with Ward, the group changed their format.<ref name="Unsung"/> By 1965, the group had renamed themselves the Ohio Players, reflecting its members\' self-perceptions as musicians and as ladies\' men.<ref name="Unsung"/>

The group added two more singers, Bobby Lee Fears and [[Dutch Robinson]], and became the [[house band]] for the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[Compass Records]]. In 1967, they added vocalist Helena Ferguson Kilpatrick, who had just returned from [[George Gershwin]]\'s European Tour of \'\'[[Porgy and Bess]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The group disbanded again in 1970. After again re-forming with a line-up including Bonner, Satchell, Middlebrooks, Jones, Webster, trumpeter Bruce Napier, vocalist Charles Dale Allen, trombonist Marvin Pierce, and [[keyboardist]] [[Walter Morrison|Walter "Junie" Morrison]], the Players had a minor hit on the Detroit-based Westbound [[record label|label]] in with "Pain" ([[1971 in music|1971]]), which reached the [[Top 40]] of the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]]. James Johnson joined the group at this time as vocalist and saxophonist.

Osborne\'s father, Clarence "Legs" Osborne, was a popular [[trumpet]]er who played with [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Count Basie]], and [[Duke Ellington]] and died when Osborne was thirteen.<ref name="vh1.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/osborne_jeffrey/bio.jhtml |title=Jeffrey Osborne Bio &#124; Jeffrey Osborne Career &#124; MTV |publisher=Vh1.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref> Osborne started his music career in 1970 with a band called Love Men Ltd., who would later become known as L.T.D.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jeffrey+Osborne |title=Last.fm |publisher=Last.fm |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref> The band recorded [[hit single]]s such as "[[(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again]]", "Concentrate on You," "[[Love Ballad (L.T.D. song)|Love Ballad]]" and "[[Holding On (When Love Is Gone)]]". At first, Osborne was a drummer, sharing lead vocal duties with his brother Billy, but by 1978 he became the group\'s primary lead vocalist.  He and Billy both left L.T.D. in early 1980 to start [[solo (music)|solo]] careers. His solo success includes five [[music recording sales certification|gold]] and [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] albums.<ref name="vh1.com"/>

==Solo career==
In 1982, Osborne released his [[Jeffrey Osborne (album)|self-titled debut album]], which featured two hit singles, "On the Wings of Love" and "I Really Don\'t Need No Light", peaking at #29 & #39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]] respectively.  This was followed up the next year by \'\'[[Stay with Me Tonight (album)|Stay with Me Tonight]]\'\', his first gold album (later reaching platinum album status), which spawned two more hits, "Don\'t You Get So Mad" (#25) and the title track (#30). "Stay with Me Tonight" (April 1984, #18) and "On the Wings of Love" (June 1984, #11) reached the [[UK Singles Chart]].

In 1985, he wrote the [[lyrics]] to the [[Whitney Houston]] hit "All at Once" (music by [[Michael Masser]]). He appeared on [[USA for Africa]]\'s fundraising single, "[[We Are the World]]" in 1985.  He would later appear on \'\'[[Celebrity Duets]]\'\' in 2006, performing "On The Wings Of Love" with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. Osborne lent his vocals to the theme song of the [[soap opera]], \'\'[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]\'\', from 1992 to 1995<ref name="vh1.com"/> as well as the first season theme song for the [[Kirstie Alley]] comedy \'\'[[Veronica\'s Closet]]\'\'

Osborne had two more gold albums, \'\'Don\'t Stop\'\' and \'\'Emotional\'\', the latter of which had his highest [[record chart|charting]] solo [[pop music|pop]] hit, "[[You Should Be Mine (The Woo Woo Song)]]", which peaked at #13 in 1986.

The following year, Osborne had the highest-charting hit of his career [[duet (music)|duetting]] with [[Dionne Warwick]] on "Love Power", which reached #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] and also topped the [[Adult Contemporary]] singles chart. This was a turning point in his pop success, as his albums and singles began charting lower and lower on the pop charts. Osborne\'s 1988 single "She\'s on the Left" would be his final Hot 100 entry, as well as his only #1 R&B hit.

After scoring two more substantial R&B hits in the early 1990s, "Only Human" and "If My Brother\'s in Trouble", Osborne would be absent from the charts for the remainder of the decade.

In the new millennium, he returned with a series of albums that, while far from the success he enjoyed in the 1980s, returned him to Adult R&B radio, scoring modest chart singles such as "Rest of Our Lives" (#75, 2003) and his cover of [[Barbara Mason]]\'s classic "[[Yes, I\'m Ready]]" (#64, 2005).

In 2008, Osborne sang the [[The Star Spangled Banner|national anthem]] before Game 4 of the [[2008 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], a feat which he repeated in 2009, before Game 1 of the 2009 NBA Finals, and also again in 2010 before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, all at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. He also performed the national anthem prior to Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]], a feat he repeated two years later at Game 3 of the [[1990 World Series]], both at the [[Oakland Alameda County Coliseum]] in [[Oakland, California]].  He also regularly sang the national anthem before [[Hartford Whalers]] games.

On March 1, 2010, Osborne appeared on \'\'[[The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love]]\'\' season finale, "After the Final Rose", singing his hit "On the Wings of Love" while Bachelor [[Jake Pavelka]] took to the dance floor with his newly announced fiance, Vienna Girardi.

\'\'\'Outkast\'\'\' (stylized as \'\'\'OutKast\'\'\') was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo formed in 1992, in [[East Point, Georgia|East Point, Atlanta, Georgia]], composed of Atlanta-based rappers [[Andr\xc3\xa9 3000|Andr\xc3\xa9 "Andr\xc3\xa9 3000" Benjamin]] (formerly known as Dr\xc3\xa9) and [[Big Boi|Antwan "Big Boi" Patton]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> They were originally known as Two Shades Deep but later changed the group\'s name to OutKast. The group\'s original musical style was a mixture of [[Dirty South (music)|Dirty South]] and [[G-funk]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p111701/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Biography]</ref> Subsequently however, [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronic music]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[spoken word]] poetry, [[jazz]], and [[blues]] elements have been added to the group\'s musical palette.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Speakerboxxx/The Love Below|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r651638|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2003|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name="cnn">{{cite news|title=OutKast propels hip-hop to new heights|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/04/15/outkast/index.html |work=CNN.com|date=April 15, 2004| accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref>

After forming the group as high school students in 1992, Outkast released their debut album \'\'[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]\'\' (1994), which gained popularity after the single "[[Player\'s Ball]]", reached number one on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. With successive releases including \'\'[[ATLiens]]\'\' in 1996, \'\'[[Aquemini]]\'\' in 1998 and \'\'[[Stankonia]]\'\' in 2000, Outkast continually experimented and developed their music. In 2003, the duo released the [[double album]] \'\'[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]\'\', which featured the number one singles "[[Hey Ya!]]" and "[[The Way You Move]]". \'\'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\'\' won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2004, the first and only for a hip hop group. Outkast next created [[Idlewild (OutKast album)|the soundtrack]] for the 2006 musical film \'\'[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]\'\', which they starred in. Since 2007, Outkast has been on hiatus and both members have pursued their solo careers, although the group moved to [[Epic Records]] in September 2011. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide in 2014, beginning at the [[Coachella Festival]] in April.<ref>[http://www.stereogum.com/1623152/coachella-2014-lineup/news/ Coachella 2014 Lineup]. Stereogum (January 8, 2014). Retrieved on 2014-05-28.</ref>

The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six [[Grammy Awards]]. Between [[Outkast discography|six studio albums]] and a [[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast|greatest hits]] release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' and [[Pitchfork Media]] listing albums such as \'\'Aquemini\'\' and \'\'Stankonia\'\' among the best of their era.

==History==

===1992\xe2\x80\x9394: Early years and debut===
[[File:Lenox Square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Andr\xc3\xa9 3000 and Big Boi met as teenagers at Atlanta\'s [[Lenox Square]] shopping center (pictured).]]
Benjamin and Patton met in 1992 at the [[Lenox Square]] shopping mall when they were both sixteen years old.<ref name="Melody">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/22/entertainment/ca-40125|title=Melody Makers of Hip-Hop|last=Guzman|first=Isaac|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein|date=October 22, 2000|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The two lived in the [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] section of [[Atlanta]] and attended [[Tri-Cities High School]].<ref name="Melody"/>  During school, Benjamin and Patton participated in [[rap battle]]s in the cafeteria.<ref name="Melody"/> Benjamin\'s parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Patton had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Benjamin and Patton eventually teamed up and were pursued by [[Organized Noize]], a group of local producers who would later make hits for [[TLC (music)|TLC]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> The duo initially wanted to be called "2 Shades Deep" or "The Misfits", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use "OutKast" based on finding "outcast" as [[synonym]] for "misfit" in a dictionary.<ref name="notable bio">{{cite web|title=OutKast Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Li-Ou/OutKast.html|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2006|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref> OutKast, [[Organized Noize]], and schoolmates [[Goodie Mob]] formed the nucleus of the [[Dungeon Family]] organization.

OutKast signed to [[LaFace Records]] in 1992, becoming the label\'s first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the [[remix]] of labelmate [[TLC (music)|TLC]]\'s "What About Your Friends". During the [[holiday season]] of 1993, they released their first [[Single (music)|single]], "[[Player\'s Ball]]". The song\'s [[funk music|funky]] style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. "Player\'s Ball" hit number-one on the \'\'[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\'\' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Their debut album,  \'\'[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]\'\', was issued on April 26, 1994. This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many. Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by [[Organized Noize]] and featured other members of the Dungeon Family.  Follow-up singles included the title track and "Git Up Git Out", a politically charged collaboration with [[Goodie Mob]] that was later sampled by [[Macy Gray]] for her 1999 hit "Do Something." On this early material, both Andr\xc3\xa9 and Big Boi contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of [[pimp]]s and [[gangster]]s with politically conscious material commenting on the status of [[African Americans]] in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the [[Source Awards]] in 1995.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> In the same year, the group contributed "Benz or a Beamer" to the popular [[New Jersey Drive]] soundtrack.

===1996\xe2\x80\x9399: Breakthrough - \'\'ATLiens & Aquemini\'\'===

For this album, OutKast joined with partner [[Mr. DJ|David "Mr. DJ" Sheats]] to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks. "[[ATLiens (song)|ATLiens]]" was the group\'s second [[Top 40]] single (following "Player\'s Ball" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of Andr\xc3\xa9\'s increasingly sober lifestyle:<ref>(September 18, 2005).

OutKast\'s third album \'\'[[Aquemini]]\'\' was released on September 29, 1998 and also reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the [[zodiac sign]]s of Big Boi (an [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]) and Andr\xc3\xa9 (a [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]). The album was widely praised as possibly the group\'s best material to date: when reviewed by popular hip-hop publication [[The Source (magazine)|\'\'The Source\'\']], it received the much-coveted "5 Mics" (out of five) rating.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Producing more material themselves, both Big Boi and Andr\xc3\xa9 explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by [[soul music|soul]], [[trip hop]], and [[electro music]]. The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with [[Raekwon]], [[Slick Rick]], [[funk music|funk]] pioneer and musical forebear [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], and Goodie Mob.

 |description  = In 2009, "(Bombs Over Baghdad)" placed no. 1 on \'\'[[Pitchfork Media]]\'\'<nowiki>\'</nowiki>s list of 500 Top Tracks of the 2000s}}
Originally titled \'Sandbox\', the pair\'s fourth album, \'\'[[Stankonia]]\'\' was released in October 2000 to  positive reviews. The album was seen as a change in the group\'s musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple-platinum]]. \'\'[[Stankonia]]\'s\'\' first single was "[[B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)]]", a high-[[tempo]] [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]]-influenced record. The second single, "[[Ms. Jackson]]", combined a pop hook with lyrics about [[divorce]] and relationship breakups, particularly Andr\xc3\xa9\'s breakup with singer [[Erykah Badu]]; the titular "Ms. Jackson" character being a [[doppelg\xc3\xa4nger]] for Badu\'s mother. It was at this time that Andr\xc3\xa9 changed his stage name to the current "Andr\xc3\xa9 3000".

The single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] chart, and the number-two position on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album\'s final single was the Organized Noize-produced "So Fresh, So Clean", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member [[Sleepy Brown]] and garnered a remix featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]. All three singles\' videos had heavy [[MTV2]] airplay, and OutKast won two 2001 [[Grammy Award]]s, one for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "Ms. Jackson", and another for \'\'[[Stankonia]]\'\' as [[Best Rap Album]].<ref>Cowie, Del F..

[[Pitchforkmedia.com]] named Stankonia the 4th greatest album released between 2000 and 2004 in its 2005 [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40568-the-top-100-albums-of-2000-04-part-two feature]. Later on the webzine selected Stankonia as the 13th best album of the 2000s. And B.O.B. was chosen number one song of the decade by this same webzine.<ref>[http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7693-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-20-1/2/ Staff Lists: The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s: 20-1 | Features].

In December 2001, OutKast released a [[greatest hits]] album, \'\'[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]\'\', which also contained three new tracks. One of these new tracks was the single "[[The Whole World]]", which won a 2002 Grammy Award for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. [[Killer Mike]] also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called "Funkin\' Around" and "Movin\' Cool (The After Party)".

===2002\xe2\x80\x9304: \'\'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\'\'===
OutKast spent 2 years working on their 5th effort, before releasing a double album, \'\'[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]\'\', on September 23, 2003. It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the OutKast banner; the two members also appear and co produce on each other\'s discs for a few songs apiece. Big Boi\'s \'\'Speakerboxxx\'\' is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; Andr\xc3\xa9 3000\'s \'\'The Love Below\'\' features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in [[funk music|funk]], jazz, rock, electronic music, and [[R&B]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The album is also OutKast\'s biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks. The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certification, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|diamond]] for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi\'s "[[The Way You Move]]" and Andre 3000\'s "[[Hey Ya!]]" The video\'s storyline has "The Love Below"\xe2\x80\x94a fictional band with all members, through the use of [[special effects]], played by Andr\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94performing in [[London]]. "Hey Ya!" was the number one song on the very final weekend of \'\'American Top 40 with [[Casey Kasem]]\'\'. It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the [[Hot 100]] singles chart, with "Hey Ya!" spending nine weeks and "The Way You Move" taking over for one week in February 2004. These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

OutKast\'s next official single was not released until the summer of 2004. "[[Roses (OutKast song)|Roses]]", a track featuring both members from \'\'The Love Below\'\' half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for "Roses" is loosely based on the musicals \'\'[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]\'\' and \'\'[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]\'\'. It featured sparring 1950s-style gangs, one representing Speakerboxxx, and one representing The Love Below, parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better. The final singles were Andr\xc3\xa9 3000\'s "[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Prototype]]", which was paired with a [[science fiction]]-themed video about alien visitors, and \'\'Speakerboxxx\'s\'\' "[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Ghettomusick]]", which featured both members of OutKast and a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from a song by [[Patti LaBelle]], who also makes an appearance in the video.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

\'\'Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\'\' won the Grammy Award for the 2004 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], becoming the first album consisting solely of hip-hop to receive the honor. (\'\'[[The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill]]\'\' by [[Lauryn Hill]] won best album in 1999 but was predominantly an R&B album.) OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed "The Way You Move" with the Outkast backing band during a medley with Earth Wind & Fire, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], while Andr\xc3\xa9 3000 performed "Hey Ya!" as the show closer after they had been presented with the Album Of The Year Award.

===2005\xe2\x80\x9306: \'\'Idlewild\'\'===
Members also began working on a joint film, \'\'[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]\'\', directed by OutKast music video director [[Bryan Barber]]. \'\'Idlewild\'\', a [[Prohibition]]-era musical film set to a [[blues]]-influenced hip-hop soundtrack, was released on August 25, 2006 by [[Universal Pictures]]. The \'\'[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild soundtrack]]\'\' was released August 22, 2006.

The first single of the album, "Mighty \'O\'", features both [[Andr\xc3\xa9 3000]] and [[Big Boi]]; the song takes its lyrical  hook from the [[Cab Calloway]] song "[[Minnie the Moocher]]" ("Mighty-ighty-ighty O") and seems to be an example of the album\'s mix of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and more traditional American [[jazz]] and [[blues music|blues]].  Next, similar to previous OutKast albums such as \'\'[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]\'\', two [[single (music)|singles]]\xe2\x80\x94one solely by Big Boi, the other solely by Andr\xc3\xa9 3000\xe2\x80\x94were released simultaneously.  The second single, almost exclusively featuring Big Boi, is the [[marching band]]\xe2\x80\x93influenced "Morris Brown", featuring guest artists [[Sleepy Brown]] and Scar, both artists on Big Boi\'s [[Purple Ribbon Records|Purple Ribbon]] label. The song\'s title is a reference to [[Atlanta]]\'s [[Morris Brown College]], with the school\'s marching band providing the instrumentation.

The third single, Andr\xc3\xa9 3000\'s "Idlewild Blue (Don\'tchu Worry \'Bout Me)" delves into the [[blues]] genre, complete with a blues-style [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] riff and a [[harmonica]] element reminiscent of \'\'[[Aquemini]]\'\' single "Rosa Parks". In tune with the film, \'\'Idlewild\'\' reflects OutKast\'s original style tempered by 1930s influences. The fourth single, "Hollywood Divorce" was released in November 2006, and features verses from [[Lil\' Wayne]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] and is produced by Andr\xc3\xa9 3000.

===2007\xe2\x80\x9313: Hiatus and solo work===
In 2007 after the sixth album under the OutKast name, \'\'[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]\'\', Big Boi announced plans to release a full-fledged solo album. While he had released a previous solo album in \'\'Speakerboxxx\'\', it still was technically under the OutKast name. The album was to be titled \'\'[[Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty]]\'\'. The album\'s first promotional single, "Royal Flush", was released in 2007, and featured [[Raekwon]] and Andr\xc3\xa9 3000. After many delays and setbacks, the album was finally released internationally on July 5, 2010. Guest artists include singer Janelle Mon\xc3\xa1e; Big Boi\'s own new group Vonnegutt; plus established rappers T.I. and B.o.B.<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/559/boi_o_boi/ Big Boi: Boy O Boi!].

== Film projects==

He voiced a crow in \'\'[[Charlotte\'s Web (2006 film)|Charlotte\'s Web]]\'\', a movie adaptation of the [[Charlotte\'s Web|1952 children\'s book]]. As of November 2006, he voiced "Sunny Bridges," a prize-winning musician who gives up touring to teach at his [[alma mater]], in \'\'[[Class of 3000]]\'\', an animated series he produced on [[Cartoon Network]]. He has also worked with [[Esthero]] on a promotional version of "Jungle Book" which was on a \'\'Wikked lil\' grrrls\'\' sampler, but never made it to the actual album due to issues with Esthero\'s label, [[Warner Bros.]].
The following year, he appeared in the basketball comedy \'\'[[Semi-Pro]]\'\', with [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Will Ferrell]]. He also starred in the 2008 film \'\'[[Battle in Seattle]]\'\', a film about the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|1999 Seattle World Trade Organization protests]]. Benjamin was a member of [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Lawrence Bender]]\'s production company [[A Band Apart]] until its close in 2006; he then formed his own company, Moxie Turtle.

Big Boi appeared on [[Nick Cannon]]\'s \'\'[[Wild \'n Out]]\'\' Season 3 as one of the many guest stars, as well as guest starring and appearing as a musical guest on \'\'[[Chappelle\'s Show]]\'\' performing his song "The Rooster".

Big Boi played hip-hop artist "Got$ Money".

== Lawsuit ==
In April 1999, OutKast and [[LaFace Records]] were [[lawsuit|sued]] by [[Rosa Parks]] over the album\'s most successful radio single, which bears Parks\' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks\' name, and it objected to the song\'s [[obscenity|obscenities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Rosa Parks Sues OutKast|journal=Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=April 17, 1999|volume=108|issue=4|page=6}}</ref>

The song\'s lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: "Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus". The song, which OutKast maintained was intended partly as [[Homage (arts)|homage]], refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song\'s chorus is to imply that OutKast is overturning hip hop\'s old order, that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for OutKast. 

However, later on appeal, the issue of whether OutKast violated the Lanham Act for false advertising was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court\'s determination that the title "Rosa Parks" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks\' representation hired lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]] to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court\'s decision.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks\' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company [[BMG]]. In December 2003, Andr\xc3\xa9 told [[United Kingdom]] journalist Angus Batey that, following a Detroit concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Rosa than with the lawyers.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-2302431.html The Sunday Times].

b'{{More footnotes|date=September 2010}}
\'\'\'Melvin Parker\'\'\' (born June 7, 1944, [[Kinston, North Carolina]]) is a [[drummer]]. He and his brother, saxophonist [[Maceo Parker]] were important members of [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]]\'s band.  Parker\'s drumming style was a major ingredient in James Brown\'s funk music innovations in the late 1960s.<ref>http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=Melvin+Parker%2Bjames+bro</ref> In 1964 and 1965 Parker was the drummer on three of Brown\'s recordings: "Out of Sight," "[[Papa\'s Got A Brand New Bag]]," and "[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]."<ref name=Bryan>Sarah Bryan, Beverly Patterson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bZblAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&dq=melvin+parker+drummer+%22Out+of+Sight,%22+%22Papa%27s+Got+A+Brand+New+Bag%22+%22I+Got+You+%28I+Feel+Good%29&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sFjyVOzhOsnxUKbrgugF&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=melvin%20parker%20drummer%20%22Out%20of%20Sight%2C%22%20%22Papa\'s%20Got%20A%20Brand%20New%20Bag%22%20%22I%20Got%20You%20(I%20Feel%20Good)&f=false \'\'African American Music Trails of Eastern North Carolina\'\'], North Carolina Arts Council, 2013, p. 18.</ref>

Parker\'s first association with Brown ended when he was [[conscription|drafted]] in the mid-1960s.  He was replaced in the band by [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[Jabo Starks]].  Parker rejoined the band in 1969, and appeared on the [[album]] \'\'[[Sex Machine (album)|Sex Machine]]\'\'.  In 1970 Parker was part of the famous mutiny by the James Brown band. After leaving Brown, Parker went on to join his brother Maceo\'s band, Maceo & All the King\'s Men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Melvin+Parker |title=Melvin Parker Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> He rejoined James Brown briefly in 1976, and played on Brown\'s hit single "[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]".<ref name=Bryan />

\'\'\'Pleasure\'\'\' was a band from [[Portland, Oregon]] that blended soul, funk and jazz with a tough street edge that became a cult group on the underground black music scene of the late 70\'s.  They are perhaps best known for their 1979 hit, "Glide".

==Career==
Pleasure was formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1972 as a merger of two Portland outfits: Franchise and The Soul Masters which included guitarist Marlon "The Magician" McClain, bassist Nathaniel Phillips, and drummer Bruce Carter, keyboardist Donald Hepburn, saxophonist Dennis Springer, trombonist Dan Brewster and lead singer Sherman Davis. In 1974 [[The Crusaders]]\'s [[Wayne Henderson (musician)|Wayne Henderson]] saw them performing in a Portland club. Impressed with what he heard, his enthusiasm led them to a deal with [[Fantasy Records]]. This was the beginning of a six-year relationship with the label and a four-year relationship with Wayne Henderson who through his own production company "At Home Productions", was the band\'s producer and mentor. Along the way, members of the band did session work with artists like [[Side Effect]], [[Gabor Szabo]], [[Ronnie Laws]] and [[Willie Bobo]] to name a few. In 1979, Pleasure would have their best success with the Top Ten R&B hit "Glide" By 1982 after a one off album for [[RCA Records|RCA]] the band called it quits.

Drummer Bruce Carter (December 28, 1956) died on August 12, 2006.

\'\'\'Praxis\'\'\' was the name of an [[experimental rock]] project, led by prolific producer/bassist [[Bill Laswell]] and featuring guitarist [[Buckethead]] and drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] in nearly every incarnation of the band.

The group worked with many other artists such as [[Serj Tankian]] from [[System of a Down]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Grand Mixer DXT|DXT]] and [[DJ Disk]].

==Biography==
===Early days===
Bill Laswell initially used the name Praxis for an experimental solo EP recorded for [[Celluloid Records]] in 1984, simply named "1984".

===1992\xe2\x80\x931996===
The band\'s debut album, \'\'[[Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis)]]\'\', released in 1992 was well received by critics. Praxis was composed of [[Buckethead]], keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] drummer [[Bryan Mantia|Brain]],  bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] and [[Jungle Brothers|Afrika Baby Bam]] as AF Next Man Flip on turntables. Bill Laswell masterminded the project and served as producer and co-writer of much of the album\'s material. Praxis combined elements of different musical genres such as [[funk music|funk]], [[jazz music|jazz]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] into highly improvised music. The [[P-Funk]]-inspired track "[[Animal Behavior (Praxis single)|Animal Behavior]]," with a lead vocal from Collins, was released as a single. A video was also shot for the track.

Their next studio album, \'\'[[Sacrifist]]\'\', was released two years later on the new Laswell-led label [[Subharmonic (record label)|Subharmonic]] and featured a rotating roster of guests including sax player [[John Zorn]], drummer [[Mick Harris]] from [[Painkiller (band)|Painkiller]], and members of the band [[Blind Idiot God]]. The [[death metal]]-influenced album was not as acclaimed as their debut.<br />

The same year saw the album [[Metatron (Praxis album)|Metatron]], with a trio of Buckethead, Laswell and Brain, which included the song "Wake the Dead".

In 1996 the band toured Europe and recorded two live albums called \'\'[[Live in Poland (Praxis album)|Live in Poland]]\'\' and \'\'[[Transmutation Live]]\'\' containing material from shows in [[Zurich]] and [[Warsaw]]. Both albums featured members of the [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]]. After the shows, the project broke up.

===1997\xe2\x80\x932004===
In 1997, [[Bill Laswell]] re-released his [[Material (band)|Material]] EP \'\'[[1984 (Praxis album)|1984]]\'\' under the Praxis name. This was followed by the album \'\'[[Mold (Praxis album)|Mold]]\'\' with [[Pat Thrall]], Peter Wetherbee and Alex Haas instead of [[Buckethead]], [[Bryan Mantia]] and [[Bernie Worrell]] respectively. The album was essentially somewhat of a remix album with Wetherbee and crew taking elements from 1984 and crafting a full-length release. Laswell\'s involvement with this album was minimal. In 1998, Laswell contributed "Dreadnot" to the compilation \'\'Abstract Depressionism\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silent-watcher.net/billlaswell/discography/collections/abstractdepressionism.html|title=Bill Laswell Discography |publisher=silent-watcher.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}</ref> Though labeled a Praxis track, this was essentially a solo Laswell creation.

In the same year a first compilation album also containing two songs from the [[Buckethead|Death Cube K]] album \'\'[[Dreamatorium]]\'\' (Death Cube K is an anagram of Buckethead) was made available. 
In 1999, a re-worked version of \'\'Live in Poland\'\' was released as \'\'[[Warszawa (Praxis album)|Warszawa]]\'\'. Little was heard of the band for the next years, while Brain and Buckethead played for [[Guns N\' Roses]] and Laswell concentrated more on his dub releases.

===2004\xe2\x80\x932010===
Most original members reunited for a small tour in 2004 culminating in their appearance as part of a Bill Laswell themed episode of the PBS series Soundstage. Laswell also began working on their next studio album \'\'[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)]]\'\', but due to the label (Sanctuary) going broke the project was put on hold for about three years.

In 2005 \'\'Transmutation Live\'\' was re-worked and re-released as \'\'[[Zurich (Praxis album)|Zurich]]\'\'.
Another live album called \'\'[[Tennessee 2004]]\'\' was released in 2007 which was a trunacated version of a longer show performed at the Bonnarroo festival.

On January 1, 2008 the studio album \'\'[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)]]\'\' was released in Japan with guest contributions by [[Serj Tankian]], [[Mike Patton]] and [[Iggy Pop]] as well as Buckethead\'s old friend [[Maximum Bob (singer)|Maximum Bob]] and many more.

===2011: End of the band===

In early 2011, \'\'[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)|Profanation]]\'\' was re-released on Bill Laswell\'s new [[M.O.D. Technologies]] label with two additional live tracks. Later that month Bill Laswell stated in an interview that there was likely no more future for the band:

{{quotation|I doubt it. I think they\xe2\x80\x99re like closed chapters, but fairly well-documented ones. [...] The same thing goes for Praxis. [[Buckethead]] has mostly been performing solo. He also had a health issue recently with his back, so he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that active. If you want to do something new, there are better things to do than going back to something you did years ago and starting it over.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/laswell2.html |title=Interview with Bill Laswell by Anil Prasad (1/11) |publisher=Innerviews.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29}}</ref>}}

M.O.D. Technologies also has a vinyl version of \'\'[[Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)|Profanation]]\'\' scheduled for an April 2013 release.

== Musical styles ==
Between the influence of Laswell and Buckethead, Praxis\' musical experimentation in both studio, street and live settings have combined elements of mid-70\xe2\x80\x99s [[Funkadelic]] & [[Miles Davis]], hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s more avant-garde leanings, and [[Last Exit (Free jazz band)|Last Exit]]\'s ferocious yet organic jazz/metal aesthetic. Many of these experiments defined (and in some sense, invented) diverse, eclectic, and freeform genres including avant-garde, heavy metal, funk and jazz-fusion.

\'\'\'Ready for the World\'\'\' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] band from [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]], that scored several [[pop music|pop]], [[soul music|soul]], and dance [[hit record|hits]] in the mid to late 1980s. They were founded by Melvin Riley and Gordon Strozier.

==History==
The group originally consisted of frontman Melvin Riley, Gordon Strozier ([[lead guitar]]), Gregory Potts ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Willie Triplett ([[percussion]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), John Eaton ([[bass guitar]]), and Gerald Valentine ([[Drum kit|drums]]). They had performed throughout Flint at high school talent shows and were discovered by [[WJLB]] [[Detroit]] Radio personality The Electrifying Mojo in 1982. They gained regional fame with their first release, "Tonight," in 1983. "Tonight" was an underground hit in Flint and Detroit which helped garner them national prominence shortly after their signing under the MCA label. They recorded their debut album, \'\'Ready for the World\'\', during 1984 with producer Bernard Terry and engineer Charles Brown, Jr.

==Success==
In 1985, the band signed to the Steven Machat-Rick Smith management company, AMI. The agreement with MCA was redrawn, and promotion and marketing dollars were committed to promote the group. This proved successful as the group was steered to #1 on the US pop charts as well as top five in all the Western European countries and Australia, with their best-known hit "[[Oh Sheila]]." In the US, this song went to #1 on the [[R&B Chart|R&B]], [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop Charts]], and the [[Hot Dance Club Play]] [[record chart|charts]] that year, becoming the first ever single to hold the #1 spot on all three of these charts simultaneously.  The song "[[Digital Display]]" followed and hit #21.

In 1986, the band released their second album, \'\'[[Long Time Coming (Ready for the World album)|Long Time Coming]]\'\', produced by: Gary Spaniola which returned them to the [[Top 40|Top 10]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop charts]] with the [[slow jam]], "[[Love You Down]]," which peaked at #9.

Ready for the World went on to release several more albums that failed to capture the success of the group\'s first two releases, and as a result, they disbanded in 1991.

==Post-breakup==
After the breakup, lead singer Riley went on to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] [[solo (music)|solo]] [[album]]s. He released \'\'Ghetto Love\'\' on MCA in 1994 and \'\'Bedroom Stories\'\' on the independent label Bogard Entertainment Group in 2000. A Ready for the World reunion album \'\'She Said She Wants Some\'\' followed in 2004 featuring mostly urban [[ballad]]s.

Rebirth is known for combining traditional New Orleans brass band music, including the New Orleans tradition of [[Second line (parades)|second line]] with [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[hip hop]].<ref name="Burns"/>{{rp|113}} In 1993, Ruffins and Rebirth split amicably after Ruffins decided not to accompany the band on a trip to Africa.

Rebirth\'s longstanding regular Tuesday night gig at the [[Maple Leaf Bar]] on Oak Street in the [[Carrollton, Louisiana|Carrollton]] neighborhood of Uptown [[New Orleans]] is one of the pillars of the New Orleans music scene, and has served as a reliable introduction to the city\'s nightlife for many new arrivals to the city.

The band regularly tours North America and Europe. In 2011, [[Basin Street Records]] released the CD \'\'Rebirth of New Orleans\'\', which reached number 1 on the [[CMJ]] Jazz charts and earned the group a 2012 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Regional Roots Music Album.<ref>Spera, Keith.

\'\'\'Republic of Loose\'\'\' were<ref name="twitter.com">https://twitter.com/MIKPYRO/status/499223935196889088</ref> an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[funk]] [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Dublin]]. Formed in 2001, the band formerly consisted of lead vocalist [[Mick Pyro]], [[bass guitar]]ist and vocalist Benjamin Loose, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] Darragh, guitarists and vocalists Dave Pyro and Darach O\' Laoire and [[Drum kit|drum]]mers and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]ists  Andre Lopes. Additional percussion and vocals are provided by Orla La and Emily Rose

With a self-described musical style of "the stuff your dad likes", the band signed to [[Big Cat Records]] in 2003, recording their debut album \'\'[[This is the Tomb of the Juice]]\'\' which was released in 2004. They were named "Hope for 2004" at the [[2004 Meteor Awards]]. In 2005, the singles "Comeback Girl" and "You Know It" received significant airplay on Irish radio. Republic of Loose\'s second album \'\'[[Aaagh!]]\'\', released in April 2006, reached number two in the [[Irish Albums Chart]], achieving platinum sales and a [[Choice Music Prize]] nomination in the process. It spawned several more successful singles, including "Break" which achieved notoriety in [[South Africa]] where a radio station banned it following complaints regarding its allegedly explicit lyrics. \'\'[[Vol IV: Johnny Pyro and the Dance of Evil]]\'\', Republic of Loose\'s third album, was released in 2008. That album produced their highest chart performer to date, "[[The Steady Song]]", which peaked at number twelve and stayed in the [[Irish Singles Chart]] for thirteen weeks. \'\'[[Bounce at the Devil]]\'\', the band\'s fourth album, was released in 2010.

Having earned the admiration of several musicians, including members of [[Snow Patrol]] and [[U2]], as well as [[Sin\xc3\xa9ad O\'Connor]]&mdash;with whom they recorded, released and performed a duet at the [[2008 Meteor Awards]]&mdash;, the band have had their music played on radio stations in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. \'\'[[The Irish Times]]\'\' placed them at number thirty-seven in a list of "The 50 Best Irish Acts Right Now" published in April 2009,<ref name="The next 50 bands">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2009/0410/1224244309293.html|title=The next 50 bands|date=2009-04-10|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=\'\'[[The Irish Times]]\'\'|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nYhj5Zfj|archivedate=12 April 2010}}</ref> referring to them as "one of Ireland\'s most original bands" led by "the gruff singer with the extraordinary soul voice [...] simultaneously channelling the spirits of [[James Brown]] and [[James Joyce]] in one fell swoop."<ref name="The 50 best Irish music acts right now">{{cite web|author=Jim Carroll, Tony Clayton-Lea, Sin\xc3\xa9ad Gleeson, Lauren Murphy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/theticket/articles/2009/0403/1224243925837.html|title=The 50 best Irish music acts right now|date=2009-04-03|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=\'\'[[The Irish Times]]\'\'|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nYheckp6|archivedate=12 April 2010|quote=Simultaneously channelling the spirits of James Brown and James Joyce in one fell swoop, the gruff singer with the extraordinary soul voice leads Republic of Loose, one of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s most original bands.}}</ref> Aside from U2 and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]], they are the Irish band with the most airplay in their native country.<ref name="Rock -- Loose men">{{cite web|author=Neil Dunphy|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2008/apr/27/rock-loose-men/|title=Rock -- Loose men|date=2008-04-27|accessdate=2009-08-21|publisher=\'\'[[Sunday Tribune]]\'\'}}</ref> In August 2014, vocalist Mick Pyro confirmed that the band had split.<ref name="twitter.com"/>

==History==

===Formation===
Mick Pyro performed with self-described "rubbish rock bands" for several years before the formation of The Republic of Loose.<ref name="Let Loose"/> During this time, he was, according to himself, "depressed out of my brains" and listened to artists such as [[Manic Street Preachers]].<ref name="Let Loose"/> Experiencing what he termed "a huge metaphysical overturning of my value system", Pyro had developed a fascination with musicians such as [[James Brown]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], or "the stuff your Dad likes".<ref name="Let Loose"/> This change of musical interest prompted him to create Johnny Pyro, an alter-ego, who, according to Pyro, "disassociated himself from the normal lifestyle of an Irish bourgeois kid".<ref name="Let Loose"/> This alter-ego would later develop into Johnny Pyro And The Rock Coma. The band recorded an EP, which featured four of the songs that later appeared on the Republic of Loose\'s first album, \'This Is The Tomb Of The Juice.\' Following the departure of guitarist Emmet Cole (who wrote the song "Black Bread") and bassist Mark Dennehey "[http://www.roisindubh.net/artistProfile.php?artistID=21 To Texas and Ringsend]," respectively, Johnny Pyro and Rock Coma split.

About a year later the Republic of Loose was formed.<ref name="Let Loose">{{cite web|author=Eamon Sweeney|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/let-loose-1357716.html|title=Let Loose|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=\'\'[[Irish Independent]]\'\'}}</ref> Benjamin Loose studied [[theology]] in [[Trinity College, Dublin]] before performing in a country band with Mick Pyro.<ref name="Bass instincts Benjamin from Republic of Loose on his Transition Year">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2008/1022/1224454451268.html|title=Bass instincts Benjamin from Republic of Loose on his Transition Year|date=2008-10-22|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher=\'\'[[The Irish Times]]\'\'|quote=By the time I did my Leaving Cert, I wasn\'t that into journalism anymore.

\'\'\'Rufus\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] [[musical ensemble|band]] from [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] best known for launching the career of lead singer [[Chaka Khan]]. They had several [[hit record|hit]]s throughout their career, including "[[Tell Me Something Good]]", "[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]", and "[[Ain\'t Nobody]]".

==Biography==

===Origins===
In 1967, [[The American Breed]] ([[Gary Loizzo]], Al Ciner, Charles (Chuck) Colbert and Lee Graziano) had a top ten hit with the classic rock single, "Bend Me, Shape Me". After much success, Ciner, Colbert and Graziano (without Loizzo who pursued a successful production career) created a new group, adding [[Kevin Murphy (musician)|Kevin Murphy]] on keyboards and Vern Pilder from the bar band "Circus". They re-emerged in 1969 under the name "Smoke". In 1970 vocalists Paulette McWilliams and James Stella were added and the group\'s name changed again to "Ask Rufus"; after which, Willie Weeks replaced Vern Pilder.

In 1971, the band signed a contract with [[Epic Records]] recording an album that wasn\'t released after which Epic dropped their contract in early 1972. Willie Weeks was in turn replaced by Dennis Belfield,
James Stella was replaced by keyboardist and vocalist Ron Stockert, Lee Graziano was replaced by Andre Fischer (former drummer with Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler), Paulette McWilliams and [[Chaka Khan]] had met  and became the best of friends through their spouses Howard Towles and Hassan Khan. Chaka would come to most of Ask Rufus gigs when they were performing in Chicago. When Paulette decided she was leaving Ask Rufus, she went to the band and told them she had the perfect singer to replace her; she had also asked Chaka if she was interested. After the band members hesitantly submitted, Paulette remained with Ask Rufus for a few more weeks to teach Chaka all of their material. Paulette also got Chaka a gig with the group formed by Chicago\'s [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]] called Lyfe. Chaka had been performing at the Pumpkin Room on the south side of Chicago, with a local Chicago group called Lock and Chain, led by drummer Scotty Harris. With that change, and Paulette McWilliams leaving to pursue her solo career, the group recorded the first two albums as Ask Rufus and later dropped the "Ask" and simply became known as Rufus.

===Early career===
Bob Monaco was part of a booking company known as Ashley Famous  with Jim Golden, they booked Ask Rufus, with Paulette McWilliams and also The [[Rotary Connection]] with [[Minnie Ripperton]]. Monaco was also responsible for helping to get Ask Rufus their deal on ABC Dunhill. Monaco returned to Los Angeles, convinced the label to give him a demo budget and then quickly returned to Chicago where the group recorded eleven songs in two days at Marty Feldman\'s Paragon Studios. After taking the demo tapes back to ABC Dunhill the group was immediately asked to sign a long term recording contract.

Khan, who at eighteen was still a minor, had to have her mother sign along with her, even though as a married woman (newly wed to Hassan Khan, a bassist of one of her former bands), she could have done the deed herself. The group then drove to Los Angeles and recorded their first "Rufus" album at Quantum Recording Studios in Torrance, California, released in 1973.

While the songs "Whoever\'s Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)" and "Feel Good" (both featuring Khan) brought the group some attention from R&B radio stations, the album itself had minimal sales, and the Stockert-led "Slip & Slide" failed to catch major attention from pop radio.

The group quickly re-entered the same studio to record their follow-up album \'\'[[Rags to Rufus]]\'\' that included the [[Stevie Wonder]] song "[[Tell Me Something Good]]", [[Ray Parker Jr.]]\'s and Khan\'s "[[You Got The Love]]" and Dennis Belfield\'s "In Love We Grow", along with  "Smokin\' Room". Ciner and Belfield would leave the group shortly thereafter along with Stockert, who was replaced by Los Angeles-based keyboardist Nate Morgan. Additionally, Tony Maiden and bassist Bobby Watson, also from Los Angeles, were recruited by drummer Andre Fischer and asked to join the group as well. Maiden\'s, Watson\'s and Morgan\'s addition to Rufus added a unique sound to the group, bringing a stronger funk and jazz influence to complement Chaka\'s now emerging powerful lead vocals.

===Success, stardom and tension===
\'\'Rags to Rufus\'\' was released in 1974 and two of its singles \xe2\x80\x94 the [[Stevie Wonder]]-penned "[[Tell Me Something Good]]" and the Parker-Khan composition, "[[You Got the Love (Rufus song)|You Got the Love]]" \xe2\x80\x94 became smash hits leading to \'\'Rags to Rufus\'\' going [[Recording Industry Association of America|platinum]] and also landed them opening spots for the tours of several top stars including Stevie Wonder, Cheech and Chong and the Hues Corporation. "Tell Me Something Good" also brought Rufus their first [[Grammy Award]]. Due to Khan\'s increasing popularity Rufus and ABC started calling the group \'\'\'Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan\'\'\'. With this new billing, the band recorded and quickly released their next album, \'\'[[Rufusized]]\'\' in 1974. Another platinum success, the group entered the top ten again with the funk singles, "[[Once You Get Started]]", (penned by [[Gavin Christopher]]), "Stop on By", "I\'m a Woman", and "Pack\'d My Bags" (later sampled for [[Jody Watley]]\'s "Lovin\' You So") and "Please Pardon Me (You Remind Me of a Friend)", penned by good friend [[Brenda Russell]], which became popular among the group\'s legion of fans.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Heading into 1975, the group headlined their first major tour, with Khan attracting attention in concert reviews for her powerhouse vocals and [[sex symbol|sexy attire]] \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that when it came to do photo sets, Khan was often the only artist chosen to be featured on covers, mainly on magazines such as \'\'[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]\'\', which Khan would be heavily featured on throughout her long career. Also due to her off-stage antics that added to her on-stage persona, the media billed Khan as "the wild child". Due to Khan\'s vocal power and sex appeal, she was often compared to [[Tina Turner]], with some rock and soul press labeling her a "pint-sized Tina", and also to [[Aretha Franklin]] (her friends called her "little Aretha"). Attention to Khan began to make things difficult for some of the group\'s members as they felt Khan\'s presence had overshadowed the entire band\'s output. The group\'s fourth release, and the third major release where Khan was dominant lead singer, \'\'[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]\'\', was released in 1975. The major hit off the album was a compositon by Khan, Tony Maiden and Van Morrison titled "[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rufus-featuring-chaka-khan-mw0000309051 |title=Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan  |first=Jason |last=Elias |publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> which reached the top five of the charts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/sweet-thing-mt0002686353 |title=Sweet Thing |first=Ed |last=Hogan |publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> and became their fourth record to reach [[music recording sales certifications|gold]].

Despite the album\'s success as well as a second successful major tour that followed, it still didn\'t stop growing tensions within the group, particularly between Khan and longtime Rufus drummer Andre Fischer. During recording sessions of \'\'[[Ask Rufus]]\'\', Khan had married Richard Holland (she had divorced her first husband Hassan Khan in 1974 prior to the birth of their child Milini), and the presence of Holland only made things worse between Khan and Fischer. During one session of \'\'Ask Rufus\'\', Fischer engaged in a fight with Holland, who received help from a counter-attacking Khan. \'\'Ask Rufus\'\' would be released in 1977 and include the hits "[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]", "Hollywood" and "Everlasting Love", the latter two songs becoming popular among Khan fans. Following a tour to promote \'\'Ask Rufus\'\', Fischer finally left the group. He was followed out of the group by Nate Morgan. They were replaced by Richard "Moon" Calhoun and [[Hawk Wolinski|Dave "Hawk" Wolinski]], respectively. The new lineup recorded the popular album, \'\'[[Street Player]]\'\', which featured the popular Khan-composed ballad, "Stay". After first putting it off as a rumor, Khan confirmed to media reports that she was going solo, signing a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The decision strained relations between Khan and the other Rufus members. Khan released her [[Chaka (1978 album)|self-titled debut]] later in 1978. The album sold more than \'\'Street Player\'\', going platinum, thanks to the international [[Ashford & Simpson]]-composed single, "[[I\'m Every Woman]]". Khan continued to promote the album into 1979. In early 1979, Calhoun would be replaced by John "J.R." Robinson as the group\'s drummer in 1979.

===Decline and final years===
Following the Calhoun replacement, another change came when ABC Records got absorbed by [[MCA Records|MCA]], bringing the group to MCA as a result. While Khan promoted \'\'Chaka\'\', Rufus put out a less favorably received Khan-less album, \'\'[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]\'\', which tanked. Khan returned to record with the band for the [[Quincy Jones]]-produced \'\'[[Masterjam]]\'\'. By now, Rufus and Khan were split in two, both acts being treated separately. Khan\'s superstardom helped \'\'Masterjam\'\' go gold thanks to the funk-laden disco recording, "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]".

Though Khan would later say that she was ready to leave Rufus upon the time she released \'\'Chaka\'\' in 1978, she discovered that she had two more albums left in her ABC/MCA contract with the band and agreed to fulfill her obligations. Following \'\'Masterjam\'\', one of the contractual albums, and another Khan-less album, \'\'[[Party \'Til You\'re Broke]]\'\', which bombed, the factions of Rufus and Khan reunited for their last MCA album, \'\'[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]\'\' in 1981. The feelings of long overdrawn bad tensions were felt during album sessions. This resulted in situations where Khan would either record her vocals alone to a [[click track]] prior to he band\'s instrumentation being added later, or vice versa.

Unfortunately, the album failed to garner attention, mainly due to Khan\'s solo obligations, which now included two more gold-certified studio albums, \'\'[[Naughty (Chaka Khan album)|Naughty]]\'\' and \'\'[[What Cha\' Gonna Do for Me]]\'\'. With the release of \'\'Camouflage\'\', Khan was free to leave the group, and following her exit in early 1982, the remaining members of Rufus released what became their final studio album, \'\'[[Seal in Red]]\'\' in 1983 which, like their previous albums, went unnoticed.

Rufus band members sensed that their tenure was over and agreed to split on the terms they release one last live album to commemorate the occasion. The band asked Khan to contribute to their final concert performance which would be filmed by Warner Bros., and she obliged, reuniting with the group for what was to be later released as a [[documentary film]] titled \'\'Stompin\' At the Savoy\'\'. For some reason, Warner Bros. refused to release the film at that time and released only the [[Stompin\' at the Savoy - Live|live album]] instead. However the concert has since been released to home-video with remastered picture and remixed 5.1 [[Dolby Surround]] sound.

The album included four Khan-led studio songs, including a Dave Wolinski composition titled "[[Ain\'t Nobody]]", which got attention when a producer for the film, \'\'[[Breakin\']]\'\' heard it while screening songs for the movie\'s soundtrack. Warner eventually released the song (with the billing \'\'\'Rufus and Chaka Khan\'\'\') and the song became a top 30 [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] hit, reaching number-one on the R&B chart and hitting number eight on the UK singles chart. The success of the track led to the band receiving its second [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].

Following this success, Rufus went their separate ways for good with Khan continuing her solo career, becoming one of the most revered R&B artists of her generation with the release of the single "[[I Feel for You]]" cementing her reputation.

===Later years===
In 2001, Rufus (Kevin Murphy, Tony Maiden, Bobby Watson, Dave Wolinski and [[John Robinson (drummer)]]) aka J.R. Robinson and Chaka Khan reunited for a brief tour, which Khan described in her autobiography, \'\'Chaka! Through the Fire\'\' (co-written with Tonya Bolden), in 2003. Khan and Maiden reunited on the modernized Rufus medley, "Pack\'d My Bags"/ "You Got the Love", on Khan\'s double Grammy Award-winning 2007 album, \'\'[[Funk This]]\'\'. When discussing another potential reunion with Rufus during a 2008 interview with \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\', Khan said the band\'s classic lineup (which includes Andre Fischer and Nate Morgan) had no plans on reuniting, with Khan stating that touring with Tony Maiden, one of the few Rufus band mates Khan kept a close friendship with, was the closest to another Rufus reunion. A lineup of Rufus including Bobby Watson and J.R. Robinson started a short tour in 2008. Neither founding member Kevin Murphy, mainstay Tony Maiden nor Dave Wolinski participated in this tour. In September 2011, the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that the band and Khan were jointly nominated for induction to the 27th annual class. They had been eligible since 1999 (with the committee counting the band\'s first album as \'\'Rags to Rufus\'\' rather than 1973\'s \'\'Rufus\'\'). It was their first year of nomination. Earlier in the year, Khan received a solo star at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

\'\'\'John Scofield\'\'\' (born December 26, 1951, [[Dayton, Ohio]], United States),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/john-scofield/ |title=John Scofield Music, News and Photos - AOL Music |publisher=Music.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref> often referred to as "Sco", is an American [[jazz-rock]] [[guitar]]ist and [[composer]], who has played and collaborated with [[Miles Davis]], [[Dave Liebman]], [[Joe Henderson]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Joey Defrancesco|Joey DeFrancesco]], [[Herbie Hancock]],  [[Pat Metheny]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Pat Martino]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Phil Lesh]], [[Billy Cobham]], [[Medeski Martin & Wood]], [[George Duke]], [[Jaco Pastorius]], [[John Mayer]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Small |first=Mark |url=http://www.berklee.edu/bt/172/coverstory.html |title=BERKLEE &#124; Berklee College of Music |publisher=Berklee.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> and many other well-known artists. At ease in the [[bebop]] idiom, Scofield is also well versed in [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[blues]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Rock music|rock]] and other forms of modern American music.

==Biography==
Early in his life, Scofield\'s family left Ohio and relocated to the small, then mostly rural location of [[Wilton, Connecticut]]; it was here that he discovered his interest in music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/artists/scofield.htm |title=All About Jazz Bio |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>

Educated at the [[Berklee College of Music]], John Scofield eventually left school to record with [[Chet Baker]] and [[Gerry Mulligan]]. He joined the [[Billy Cobham]]/[[George Duke]] Band soon after and spent two years playing, recording and touring with them. Scofield recorded with [[Charles Mingus]] in 1976, and replaced [[Pat Metheny]] in [[Gary Burton]]\'s quartet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yanow |first=Scott |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-262946-bio--John-Scofield |title=Yahoo Music artist Bio |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> In autumn 1976 he signed a contract with [[Enja Records]], and he released his first album, \'\'[[East Meets West (album)|John Scofield]]\'\', in 1977. Around this time, he toured and recorded  with Pianist [[Hal Galper]], first on his own solo album \'\'[[Rough House (John Scofield album)|Rough House]]\'\' in 1978, and  Galper\'s album \'\'[[Ivory forest (album)|Ivory Forest]]\'\' (1980), where he is heard playing a solo rendition of [[Thelonious Monk|Thelonious Monk\'s]] "Monk\'s Mood". In 1979 he formed a trio with his mentor [[Steve Swallow]] and [[Adam Nussbaum]] which, with drummer [[Bill Stewart (musician)|Bill Stewart]] replacing Nussbaum, has become the signature group of Scofield\'s career. In 1982, he joined [[Miles Davis]], with whom he remained for three and a half years. He contributed tunes and guitar work to three Davis recordings, \'\'[[Star People]]\'\', \'\'[[You\'re Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You\'re Under Arrest]]\'\' and \'\'[[Decoy (album)|Decoy]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=40431&page=1#4 Cf. John Scofield in an interview] with John Kelman in 2011 for [[AllAboutJazz]]. Retrieved August 10, 2013</ref> 

While still with Miles Davis, he released the first of his Gramavision recordings \'\'[[Electric Outlet]]\'\' (1984). \'\'[[Still Warm]]\'\' (1985) followed after he left Davis\'s group. At the end of the Davis tenure, he started what is now referred to as his Blue Matter Band - with [[Dennis Chambers]] on drums, Gary Grainger on bass and at times either [[Mitchel Forman]], Robert Aries or [[Jim Beard]] on keyboards - releasing \'\'[[Blue Matter]]\'\', \'\'[[Loud Jazz]]\'\' and \'\'[[Pick Hits Live]]\'\'. The mid-80\'s were also the time, when [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] assembled his first own ensemble Bass Desires with [[Peter Erskine]] on drums, and [[Bill Frisell]] beside Scofield as two guitarists of distinctive but complementing styles. This \xe2\x80\x9cmost auspicious [pairing] since [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] and [[Carlos Santana]]\xe2\x80\x9d<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000188234|label=\'\'Bass Desires\'\'|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref> was only transitory and recorded just two records, the self-titled \'\'[[Bass Desires (album)|Bass Desires]]\'\' and \'\'[[Second Sight (Marc Johnson album)|Second Sight]]\'\' (1986 and 1987).

At the beginning of the 1990s, John Scofield formed his quartet that included  [[Joe Lovano]] with whom he recorded several important albums for [[Blue Note Records]]. \'\'[[Time on My Hands (John Scofield album)|Time on My Hands]]\'\' (1990), with Joe Lovano, [[Charlie Haden]] and [[Jack DeJohnette]], showcased John Scofield\'s guitar and Mingus-influenced writing. [[Bill Stewart (musician)|Bill Stewart]] subsequently became the group\'s drummer, and played on \'\'[[Meant to Be (John Scofield album)|Meant to Be]]\'\' (1991) and \'\'[[What We Do]]\'\' (1993).  In 1992, Scofield released \'\'[[Grace Under Pressure (John Scofield album)|Grace Under Pressure]]\'\', featuring fellow guitarist Bill Frisell, with Charlie Haden on bass and [[Joey Baron]] on drums. Stewart rejoined with Scofield and bassist [[Steve Swallow]] for the 1994 collaboration with [[Pat Metheny]], \'\'[[I Can See Your House from Here (John Scofield and Pat Metheny album)|I Can See Your House from Here]]\'\'.  

Towards the end of his tenure with Blue Note, John Scofield returned to a more [[funk]] and [[soul jazz]]-oriented sound, a direction which has dominated much of his subsequent output.  In 1994 and 1995, Scofield formed a core group that included organist/pianist [[Larry Goldings]], bassist [[Dennis Irwin]], and alternately drummers, [[Bill Stewart (musician)|Bill Stewart]] and [[Idris Muhammad]].  The group toured extensively, and the albums \'\'[[Hand Jive (John Scofield album)|Hand Jive]]\'\' and \'\'[[Groove Elation]]\'\' feature this funk/[[Groove (music)|groove]]/soul-jazz dimension in Scofield\'s music, bringing in tenor saxophonist [[Eddie Harris]], percussionist [[Don Alias]], trumpeter [[Randy Brecker]], and others.  He recorded the acclaimed 1997 album \'\'A Go Go\'\' with the avant garde jazz trio [[Medeski, Martin & Wood]]. Also during this period, his relationship began with British composer [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]]. First as a soloist on Turnage\'s \'\'Blood on the Floor: Elegy for Andy\'\', the two paired up to create \'\'Scorched\'\', Turnage\'s orchestrations of Scofield compositions largely form the \'\'Blue Matter\'\' period. \'\'Scorched\'\', a recording available on [[Deutsche Grammophon]], debuted in [[Frankfurt]], Germany.

He released \'\'[[\xc3\x9cberjam]]\'\' in 2002 and \'\'[[Up All Night (John Scofield album)|Up All Night]]\'\' in 2004, two albums on which he experiments with [[drum n bass]] and other modern rhythms.  John Scofield has also worked and recorded in Europe with [[Nu jazz|nu-fusionist]] [[Bugge Wesseltoft]] New Conception of Jazz in 2001/2 and 2006.  Late 2004 saw the release of \'\'[[EnRoute: John Scofield Trio LIVE]]\'\', which features the jazz trio of John Scofield, the venerable Steve Swallow on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. It was recorded live at [[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]] in NYC in December 2003. The next year, he released \'\'[[That\'s What I Say: John Scofield Plays the Music of Ray Charles]]\'\' - Scofield with an all-star guest studded collection of [[Ray Charles]] material. This led to a series of performances with [[Mavis Staples]], Gary Versace on organ, [[John Benitez (bass player)|John Benitez]] on bass, and [[Steve Hass]] on drums. 

After sitting in for two engagements in December (3rd & 4th) of 2005 with [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], Scofield has since played numerous shows with the band.

On September 26, 2006 he released \'\'[[Out Louder]]\'\', his second collaborative effort album with [[avant garde]] jazz trio [[Medeski, Martin & Wood]]. The group, known collectively as MSMW toured extensively worldwide in 2006 and 2007, with sporadic engagements planned in the future. Scofield also performs as a duo with John Medeski - aptly named The Johns and another groove trio with Scofield, Medeski and drummer Adam Deitch.

September 18, 2007 saw \'\'[[This Meets That]]\'\' released on [[EmArcy Records]] - [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]\'s jazz label, a record featuring his trio with Steve Swallow and Bill Stewart. This time John added a horn section to expand the sound of his trio. 

Never one to follow an expected path, in recent years Scofield launched a personal search for musical inspiration beyond the standard 12 bar blues and found it in "old time [[gospel music]] - the closest relative to and inspiration for the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].\xe2\x80\x9d His 2009 release \'\'[[Piety Street]]\'\' with bass legend [[George Porter, Jr.]] and singer/keyboardist [[Jon_Cleary_(musician)|Jon Cleary]].  The collaboration heard on the 2010 release \'\'[[54 (John Scofield album)|54]]\'\' had its origins back in the 90\'s when Vince Mendoza asked John Scofield to play on his first album. John has since been featured on two of Vince\xe2\x80\x99s records and his guitar sound and improvisational skills work well within Vince\xe2\x80\x99s concept. When Mendoza assumed directorship of The Metropole Orchestra, he and Scofield decided to collaborate again with a primary focus on Mendoza\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements of Scofield compositions as performed with The Metropole Orchestra.

In a return to Scofieldesque "straight ahead" jazz, he went to the studio in January 2011 with pianist/organist [[Larry Goldings]], bassist [[Scott Colley]] and drummer [[Brian Blade]], laying the tracks for a ballads album titled \'\'A Moment\'s Peace\'\' scheduled for a May 2011 release on EmArcy Records. 

In April 2010, Scofield was named an Officier of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French Ministry of Culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Scofield is currently serving as an adjunct faculty member in the Jazz Department at [[New York University]]\'s [[Steinhardt School of Education]]. 

He married Susan Scofield in 1978. They are the parents of music producer Jean Scofield (b. 1981) and Evan Scofield (1987-2013).

==Equipment==
Scofield endorses [[Ibanez]] guitars. His signature guitar, the JSM100, is based on his longtime stage and recording guitar, a 1981 [[Ibanez]] AS200 which he believes to be one of the best semi-acoustics ever built.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  He gets his tone by running a [[Pro Co RAT]] through either a [[Vox AC30]] or [[Mesa Boogie]] amplifier. Some of his effects include an Ibanez CS9 Analog Chorus, a Line 6 FM4 Filter Modeler, and a Line 6 DL4 Delay Modeler.  Some of his additional effects include a [[DigiTech Whammy|DigiTech XP100 Whammy/Wah]], a Boss EQ Pedal, a Boss Loop Station, and a Boomerang phrase sampler pedal.  John Scofield uses Dunlop Delrin 2&nbsp;mm picks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnscofield.com/equipment.html |title=John Scofield - Jazz Guitarist & Composer |publisher=Johnscofield.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}</ref>

\'\'\'Screaming Headless Torsos\'\'\' , also known as the Torsos or \'\'\'SHT\'\'\' is a genre defying [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1989 consisting of founding member and [[guitar]]ist [[David Fiuczynski]], [[vocals|vocalist]] Freedom Bremner, [[bass guitar|bassist]] David Ginyard, [[percussion]]ist Daniel Sadownick, and the alternating drum chair of Gene Lake, Skoota Warner and James "Biscuit" Rouse.

On September 26, 2014, Screaming Headless Torsos released the much anticipated "Code Red", their first new record in 9 years.  The album is true to the Torsos gumbo of styles but marks some noticeable sonic progressions. The 11 song album features guest artists and a new vocal sound. Code Red is the first Torsos record featuring vocals and vocal arrangements by lead singer Freedom Bremner. The album was produced by Torsos veteran producer Gregg Fine with, three tracks "Code Red",  "Wizard of Woo", and Sideways, being co-produced by 14 time Grammy award winning producer, Ron Saint Germain ( [[Muse the band|Muse]], [[Living Colour]], Michael Jackson, 311, Diana Ross). Guest performances by guitarist James Valentine (Maroon 5) on track 2, "Brooce Swayne", keyboardists Casey Benjamin (Robert Glasper Experiment) and Chris Fisher (Funk Nuveau) both performing contrasting vocoder /synthesizer vocals  on track 6, "Sideways" and the legendary keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]] ( [[Parliament-Funkadelic|Parliament- Funkadelic]], [[The Talking Heads]]) lays his psychedelic handy work on track 3 "Wizard of Woo", a tribute written in Bernie\'s honor by Fiuczynski.

Historically the Torsos\' music mixes and mashes guitar driven rock, jazz, hip-hop, funk, soul, r&b, reggae, and drum and bass grooves and concepts, along with future shock percussion, improvisation, acrobatic vocals, and most recently Fiuczynski\'s eastern, arabic, and african, microtonal guitar influences.  SHT\'s original line up was [[guitar]]ist [[David Fiuczynski]], [[vocals|vocalist]] Dean Bowman, [[bass guitar|bassist]] Fima Ephron, [[percussion]]ist Daniel Sadownick, and [[drummer]] [[Jojo Mayer]] (Nerve).  Drummer [[Gene Lake]]  joined the Torsos, replacing Jojo Mayer for their 2001 album \'\'Live!!\'\' and the album "Torsos 2005".  In 2001 vocalist Freedom Bremner replaced Dean Bowman. He joined the band officially in 2004 and was featured along with Dean Bowman on the album "Torsos 2005". Fima Ephron, featured on all the Torsos\' albums, left the band in 2004 replaced briefly by bassist Steve Jenkins until 2008 and the entrance of David Ginyard.  Screaming Headless Torsos has also featured many of New York\'s top musicians during their live performances including Sofia Ramos (vocals), John Medeski, (keyboards), rapper Ahmed Best, and  Reggie Washington, (bass). The Torsos\' rhythm section has also at times served as the backing band for artist, [[Meshell Ndegeocello]] , for both live in concert and on her early recordings.

Prior to the release of "Code Red",  Screaming Headless Torsos toured heavily in Mexico and Latin America and sporadically in Europe, but was absent in the United States.   After 5 years without releasing new music, SHT released the single and companion video for the song, "Dead Christmas Trees" in 2010.  In March 2012 SHT was invited to play Vive Latino 2012 in Mexico City,  the largest indie Rock Festival in the Americas.  It was the beginning of a resurgence for the band. As a result of that performance at Vive Latino, which aired on Coca-Cola television throughout Latin America, SHT was invited to Colombia\'s Jazz al Parque Festival and  on September 9, 2012, SHT performed for an audience of 20,000 at the festival in Bogot\xc3\xa1 Colombia, the largest jazz festival in South America.  At that show SHT introduced a new keyboard player/vocalist, Akie Bermiss, from the New York City band Abaraki.  Currently, the band is touring and promoting Code Red.  On September 27, 2014, the "Code Red Europe Tour"  launched with a performance at the Berklee Beantown Jazz Festival in Boston Massachusetts, followed by 15 concerts in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, Poland, The Czech Republic and Switzerland.  The band is planning a US tour, more dates in South America and Mexico, as well as the second leg of Code Red Tour Europe in March 2015 with concerts in Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland and some debuts in several countries in Eastern Europe.

\'\'\'Shakatak\'\'\' is an [[English people|English]] [[jazz-funk]] [[band (music)|band]], founded in 1980.

[[File:Shakatak 01 KT.jpg|thumb|Shakatak performing at Knebworth Park as part of the Capital Radio Jazz Festival, 1982.]]

Shakatak scored a number of [[record chart|chart]] entries, including two [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[hit single|hits]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]], [[Night Birds (album)|"Night Birds]]" (1982) and "[[Down on the Street]]" (1984), plus a further 12 entries in the \'\'[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles]]\'\'.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The group are still active and popular throughout the world, particularly in [[Japan]] and the [[Far East]], and generally produce a new [[album]] every two years on [[JVC Records]].

From their first release in August 1980, (the Bill Sharpe  composition "Steppin\'" on the [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] [[record label]]), and their first album, \'\'Drivin\' Hard\'\', the band\'s [[single (music)|singles]] and albums have entered the charts regularly.

==Career==
It was the release of "Easier Said Than Done" that gave the band the [[radio]] exposure needed for their first top-twenty hit. This record introduced their [[instrumental]]-unison [[human voice|vocal]] sound to a much wider audience, and the track stayed in the [[UK Singles Chart]] for seventeen weeks.  The follow-up, "[[Night Birds (album)|Night Birds]]", was their first single to reach the [[Top 40|top ten]], and the album of the same name gave Shakatak their first [[music recording sales certification|gold album]], entering at number four and remaining in the charts for twenty-eight weeks.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

| page= 492}}</ref>  By now a major international act, the success of the release gave them the number-one [[jazz]] album slot in Japan, and attracted interest across [[Europe]] and [[South America]]. "Night Birds" was used in the feature film, \'\'[[Away We Go]]\'\', directed by [[Sam Mendes]], and was used as the demonstration song on many Casio piano keyboards such as the Casio CT-460.

Two more albums &ndash; \'\'Invitations\'\' and \'\'Out of This World\'\' &ndash; were recorded in 1982 and 1983, resulting in several more chart hits, and paving the way for the next major breakthrough in the band\'s career. With a subtle change in musical direction, yet still retaining the band\'s identity, Jill Saward (formerly of [[Fusion Orchestra]], Brandy and Citizen Gang) became their sole [[lead singer]] to make Shakatak\'s fifth album, \'\'Down on the Street\'\'. The resulting single releases "Down on the Street" and "Watching You" had great success, and brought them attention in new parts of the world. The following year saw the release of the group\'s first [[live album]], which was recorded in both [[Tokyo]] and [[London]].

The seventh album, \'\'City Rhythm\'\', saw the development of [[songwriter|songwriting]] by all of the band members. In 1986 Saward announced that she was expecting a baby later the same year. This news allowed the band to ease their hectic touring schedule for a while, and enabled them to concentrate purely on recording for a brief period.  The band were in the top five foreign acts in Japan, and after winning the coveted Silver Award in the Tokyo International Song Festival, Shakatak were asked to produce an extra album each year exclusively for the Japanese market. By this time they had two extra albums released there entitled \'\'Into the Blue\'\' and \'\'Golden Wings\'\'. Both sold well, the latter winning the "Best Instrumental Album 1987" at the Japanese Phonograph Record Association Awards.

In 1988, Shakatak was commissioned to write the official song for the 1988 Kenwood Cup yacht race entitled \'\'Racing With The Wind\'\' which was used in Japanese [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] advertisements and was released on an album called \'\'Da Makani\'\' exclusively released in Japan.

However, following this success the band felt it was time that they re-directed their efforts back to singles, and an album for release to the rest of the world. The result was \'\'Something Special\'\', closely followed by the night club and chart hit "Mr Manic & Sister Cool" from their next [[Gramophone record|LP]], \'\'Manic and Cool\'\'.

In the 1990s, the band had success in the [[United States|US]] when they had two albums that went to No 1 in the contemporary jazz charts, and were also awarded the Japanese Grammy for best international instrumental album six years running.

Shakatak continue to appear regularly throughout the world with recent festival performances at Jakjazz, the Jakata International Jazz Festival, Bangkok, Hua Hin and the Bratislava Jazz Day.  They make annual appearances at the Billboard Clubs in Japan, and the Pizza Express Jazz Room in London, plus numerous other concert and club performances.

The band celebrated their thirtieth anniversary year in 2010.

Bassist George Anderson released his second solo album, \'\'Expressions\'\', on 3 September 2012 through [[Secret Records]]. Coming three years after his first album \'\'Positivity\'\', this album again had Anderson writing, arranging and producing all of the tracks.

Keyboardist Bill Sharpe worked with American [[jazz]] pianist [[Don Grusin]] on a joint project called \'\'Geography\'\' released in 2007. Sharpe\'s second collaboration with Grusin, \'\'Trans Atlantica\'\', was released on 3 September 2012. It was also issued through Secret Records, and included \'\'Geography\'\' as a special 2-CD package.

\'\'\'24-Carat Black\'\'\' (sometimes styled as \'\'\'The 24-Carat Black\'\'\') was an [[United States|American]] [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] band who recorded in the early 1970s.  Although they only released one album at the time, the late 1973 [[concept album]] \'\'Ghetto: Misfortune\'s Wealth\'\' produced and arranged by [[Dale Warren]], their music has been sampled numerous times.  A second album compiled of unreleased recordings, \'\'Gone: The Promises of Yesterday\'\', was released in 2009.

==History==
Dale Warren was the nephew of [[Berry Gordy]]\'s second wife, [[Ray Singleton|Raynoma]], often known as "Miss Ray".  He became a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]]-trained [[violin]]ist, and in 1961 was recruited by his aunt to work as a [[String section|strings]] [[Arrangement|arranger]] for [[Motown Records]].  After working for smaller labels including [[Shrine Records|Shrine]], he was recruited by [[Stax Records]] where he arranged and orchestrated [[Isaac Hayes]]\' albums \'\'[[Hot Buttered Soul]]\'\', \'\'[[The Isaac Hayes Movement (album)|The Isaac Hayes Movement]]\'\' and \'\'[[...To Be Continued]]\'\'.<ref name=allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p136083/biography|pure_url=yes}}  Biography by Bruce Eder at Allmusic.com]</ref><ref name=soulfuldetroit>[http://soulfuldetroit.com/archives/5259/6110.html?1034188120  Dale Warren at SoulfulDetroit.com]</ref>  In 1972, Warren was featured as a [[composer]] and [[conducting|conductor]] at the [[Wattstax]] concert.<ref name=allmusic/><ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XLdsRwpZ9oYC&pg=PA293&lpg=PA293&dq=%22dale+warren%22+wattstax&source=bl&ots=RS6guKsPjI&sig=2np9WXXCwslE9Al4OLGhEHQg2PQ&hl=en&ei=FgR1TJaPDsOQjAew0rS0Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22dale%20warren%22%20wattstax&f=false Rob Bowman, \'\'Soulsville, U.S.A.: the story of Stax Records\'\', p.269]</ref>

Around this time, Warren met and took under his wing a young soul group from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], The Ditalians.  He persuaded them to change their name to 24-Carat Black, and wrote and produced their only original recording, the late 1973 [[concept album]] \'\'Ghetto: Misfortune\'s Wealth\'\'.   The band\'s line-up was Larry Austin (bass); Tyrone Steels (percussion); Jerome Derrickson (saxophone); Ricky Foster (trumpet); James Talbert (electric piano); William Talbert (organ); and Princess Hearn, Kathleen Dent, and Valerie Malone (vocals).<ref name=straightnochaser>[http://www.straightnochaser.co.uk/reviews.php?genre=Soul  24-Carat Black at StraightNoChaser.co.uk]</ref> The album spotlighted the hardships of life in the inner city, and is divided into eight "synopses" each of which focuses on a different aspect of poverty.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name="funkmysoul"/><ref name=emusic>[http://www.emusic.com/features/spotlight/282_200503.html Ghetto: Misfortune\'s Wealth at emusic.com]</ref>  It received little attention at the time, but one later reviewer has commented:<blockquote>"Recorded under Warren\'s micro-direction with a bunch of teenagers at a time when prog rock bands were the only ones conceiving such a magnum opus, the album struggled to find its place in the market. It was too challenging for an audience looking to escape to the good times of Philadelphia or drink from the joyous wellspring of Motown. Today it stands the test of time as a deep and musically astounding meditation on the black experience in the Seventies."<ref name=straightnochaser/></blockquote>

Warren recorded other tracks with 24-Carat Black in 1974, which were unreleased for many years.  By the time of those recordings, group members included vocalists Robert Dunson, Niambi Steele (Still), and Hedda Sudduth, keyboardists Bruce Thompson and Tommy Edwards, saxophonists Henry Williams and Shakir Suleiman, guitarist Rayford Smith, and bassist John Walls, as well as Princess Hearn, Jerome Derrickson, Tyrone Steels, Ricky Foster and Miss Patrice.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/24-Carat-Black-Dale-Warren-24-Carat-Black-The-Gone-The-Promises-Of-Yesterday/release/1896210  ]</ref>
Singer Princess Hearn married Warren,<ref>[http://numerogroup.wordpress.com/2009/04/21/24ct-black-tablet-debacle/ 24 Carat Black at Numero blog site]</ref> who stayed with Stax until the company collapsed. Warren died in 1994.

==Legacy==
Band members William Talbert, Tyrone Steels, Ernest Lattimore and Gregory Ingram later formed another band, \'\'\'Shotgun\'\'\', who recorded six albums between 1977 and 1982.<ref>[http://www.black-music-collectors.com/artists/artists-S/SHOTGUN.htm  Shotgun, A FUNKLOPEDIK ARTIST REVIEW].  Accessed 22 April 2012</ref>  They also had eight hit records on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]], the most successful being "Don\'t You Wanna Make Love" which reached #35 on the R&B chart in 1979.<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=399}}</ref>

\'\'\'Side Effect\'\'\' was an [[United States|American]] [[disco]] and [[jazz-funk]] band, that recorded between 1972 and 1982.  The group was formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1972 by Augie Johnson who became their leader.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20522/biography|pure_url=yes Allmusic.com}}</ref>

==Career==
Side Effect was formed by founder and leader Augie Johnson and members, Lomita Johnson, Jim Gilstrap, Gregory Matta and Louis Patton in May 1972. The group played many [[Los Angeles]] area clubs and within a few months the group signed their first record deal with a company called Avenue of America-Gas Records with whom they recorded their first album \'\'[[Effective (album)|Effective]]\'\'. The album did not chart. Not discouraged Side Effect continued to evolve. They changed female lead vocalists, from Lomita Johnson to Sylvia Nabors, and soon joined At-Home Productions, a production company headed by [[Wayne Henderson (musician)|Wayne Henderson]] of [[The Crusaders]]. This new association would bear fruit with a new record deal with [[Fantasy Records]]. The self-titled \'\'[[Side Effect (album)|Side Effect]]\'\' was released in 1975 but it did not chart. By their third album, \'\'[[What You Need (album)|What You Need]]\'\' they had switched vocalists from Sylvia Nabors to Helen Lowe, now gospel superstar [[Helen Baylor]]. This was their first charting album going to number 26 on the R&B charts. Two more albums \'\'[[Goin\' Bananas (album)|Goin\' Bananas]]\'\' and \'\'[[Rainbow Visions]]\'\' were released now featuring vocalist Sylvia St. James who replaced Lowe but they charted moderately. After these four albums were completed, Side Effect left Fantasy Records and was picked up by [[Elektra Records]]. \'\'[[After The Rain(album)|After The Rain]]\'\' now featuring a 16 year old [[Miki Howard]] replacing St. James on vocals was released in 1980. It did not do well on the charts as well as the next two [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] albums \'\'[[Portraits (Side Effect album)|Portraits]]\'\' and \'\'[[All Aboard (Side Effect album)|All Aboard]]\'\'. Howard left the group for a solo career in 1985. The group briefly re-united and issued a single entitled "I Love You" in 1987 (Striped Horse  records label).  They later became known as Augie\'s Side Effect.

On October 10, 2014, founder Augie Johnson died at age 66.<ref>http://www.soultracks.com/story-augie-johnson-dies</ref>

\'\'\'Skull Snaps\'\'\' was a [[funk]] group active between 1963 and 1973. Until 1970 they were known as The Diplomats, and released a number of singles with some success. Renamed Skull Snaps, they released an eponymous album on the small GSF label in 1973 before disappearing.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p141861|pure_url=yes}}|title=Skull Snaps|author= |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>

\'\'\'Sly and the Family Stone\'\'\' was an American band from San Francisco. Active from 1967 to 1983, the band was pivotal in the development of soul, funk, and [[psychedelic music]]. Headed by singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]], and containing several of his family members and friends, the band was the first major American rock band to have an "[[Racial integration|integrated]], multi-[[gender]]" lineup.<ref name="hof">{{cite web|title=Sly and the Family Stone|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/sly-and-the-family-stone/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

Brothers Sly Stone and singer/guitarist [[Freddie Stone]] combined their bands (Sly & the Stoners and Freddie & the Stone Souls) in 1967. Sly and Freddie Stone, trumpeter [[Cynthia Robinson]], drummer [[Gregg Errico]],<ref>Errico\'s first name is Greg, but it was spelled Gregg on all Sly and the Family Stone releases.</ref> saxophonist [[Jerry Martini]], and bassist [[Larry Graham]] comprised the original lineup; Sly and Freddie\'s sister, singer/keyboardist [[Rose Stone]], joined within a year. They recorded five [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]] hits which reached the top 10, and four ground-breaking albums, which greatly influenced the sound of American pop, soul, [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], funk, and [[hip hop music]]. In the preface of his 1998 book \'\'For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History\'\', Joel Selvin sums up the importance of Sly and the Family Stone\'s influence on [[African American music]] by stating "there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone".<ref name=Selvin>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. xi.</ref> The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.

During the early 1970s, the band switched to a grittier funk sound, which was as influential on the music industry as their earlier work.<ref name="ErlewineSly" /> The band began to fall apart during this period because of drug abuse and ego clashes; consequently, the fortunes and reliability of the band deteriorated, leading to its dissolution in 1975.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. xi\xe2\x80\x93xix.</ref> Sly Stone continued to record albums and tour with a new rotating lineup under the "Sly and the Family Stone" name from 1975 to 1983. In 1987, Sly Stone was arrested and sentenced for cocaine use, after which he went into effective retirement.<ref name="ErlewineSly" />

== Career ==
Sly Stone was a member of a deeply religious middle-class household from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. K.C. and Alpha Stewart held the family together under the doctrines of the [[Church of God in Christ]] (COGIC) and encouraged musical expression in the household.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 1\xe2\x80\x934.</ref> After the Stewarts moved to [[Vallejo, California]], the youngest four children ([[Sly Stone|Sylvester]], [[Freddie Stone|Freddie]], [[Rose Stone|Rose]], and [[Vet Stone|Vaetta]]) formed "The Stewart Four", who released a local [[gramophone record|78 RPM single]], "On the Battlefield of the Lord" [[b-side|b/w]] "Walking in Jesus\' Name", in 1952.

While attending high school, Sylvester and Freddie joined student bands. One of Sylvester\'s high school musical groups was a [[doo-wop]] act called The Viscaynes, in which he and a Filipino teenager were the only non-white members. The Viscaynes released a few local [[single (music)|singles]], and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name "Danny Stewart".

By 1964, Sylvester had become Sly Stone and a disc jockey for San Francisco R&B radio station [[KSOL-FM|KSOL]], where he included white performers such as [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a record producer for [[Autumn Records]], producing for San Francisco-area bands such as [[The Beau Brummels]] and [[The Mojo Men]]. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles, [[Bobby Freeman]]\'s "C\'mon and Swim", was a national hit.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 12.</ref> Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939.</ref>

=== Early years ===
In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called Sly & the Stoners, which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called \'\'Freddie & the Stone Souls\'\', which included Gregg Errico on drums, and Ronnie Crawford on saxophone. At the suggestion of Stone\'s friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly and the Family Stone in March 1967. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Meanwhile, Sly recruited Larry Graham to play bass guitar.

Vaetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends, Mary McCreary and Elva Mouton, had a [[gospel music|gospel]] group called \'\'The Heavenly Tones\'\'. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to become [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]], Sly and the Family Stone\'s background vocalists.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 88; interview with Elva "Tiny" Moulton.</ref>

After a gig at the Winchester Cathedral, a night club in [[Redwood City, CA]], [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] executive David Kapralik signed the group to CBS\'s [[Epic Records]] label. The Family Stone\'s first album, \'\'[[A Whole New Thing (Sly and the Family Stone album)|A Whole New Thing]]\'\', was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such as [[Mose Allison]] and [[Tony Bennett]].<ref name="WholeNew">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 59\xe2\x80\x9360; interviews with David Kapralik and Jerry Martini.</ref> However, the album\'s low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused Clive Davis and the record label to intervene.<ref name="WholeNew" /><ref name="Fotenot">Fotenot, Robert.

==== Sound, philosophies, and influence ====
Sly Stone had produced for and performed with black and white musicians during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL\'s playlist as a D.J. Similarly, the Sly and the Family Stone sound was a [[melting pot]] of many influences and cultures, including [[James Brown]] proto-funk, [[Motown Records|Motown]] [[pop music|pop]], [[Stax Records|Stax]] soul, Broadway showtunes, and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] [[rock and roll|rock music]].<ref name="ErlewineSly">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas .

The lyrics for the band\'s songs were often pleas for peace, love, and understanding among people. These calls against racism, discrimination, and [[self-hate]] were underscored by the band\'s on-stage appearance. Caucasians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini were members of the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; [[racial integration|integration]] had only recently become enforced by law. Females Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vincent |first=Rickey |title=Funk: The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One |year=1996 |publisher=St. Martin\'s Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13499-1 |pages=91\xe2\x80\x9392 }}</ref> The band\'s gospel-styled singing endeared them to black audiences; their rock music elements and wild costuming\xe2\x80\x94including Sly\'s large [[Afro]] and tight leather outfits, Rose\'s blond wig, and the other members\' loud psychedelic clothing\xe2\x80\x94caught the attention of mainstream audiences.{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}}<ref name="Kaliss">{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}}  Kaliss, Jeff.

=== \'\'Stand!\'\' (1969) ===
[[File:Woodstock redmond stage.JPG|thumb|The Woodstock Music and Art Festival, at which Sly and the Family Stone performed on August 17, 1969.]]
In late 1968, Sly and the Family Stone released the single "[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]", which became their first #1 hit.<ref name="BillboardCharts" /> "Everyday People" was a protest against prejudice of all kinds<ref>Greenwald, Matthew.

The \'\'Stand!\'\' album eventually sold more than three million copies; its title track peaked at #22 in the U.S. \'\'Stand!\'\' is considered one of the artistic high points of the band\'s career;<ref name="StandReview" /> it contained the above three tracks as well as the songs "[[I Want to Take You Higher]]", which was the b-side of the "Stand!" single, "Don\'t Call Me Nigger, Whitey", "Sex Machine", and "You Can Make It If You Try".<ref name="StandReview" />

The success of \'\'Stand!\'\' secured Sly and the Family Stone a performance slot at the landmark [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Festival]]. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance was said to be one of the best shows of the festival.<ref name="Fotenot"/> A new non-album single, "[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]", was released the same month and went to #2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended).<ref name="BillboardCharts" /> In 1970, following the release of the [[Woodstock (film)|\'\'Woodstock\'\' documentary]], the single of "Stand!" and "I Want to Take You Higher" was reissued with the latter song now the a-side; it reached the Top 40.<ref name="BillboardCharts" />

=== Internal problems and a change of direction ===
With the band\'s new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146\xe2\x80\x93152.</ref> Epic requested more marketable output.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</ref> The [[Black Panther Party]] demanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire manager David Kapralik.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 85.</ref><ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 89; interview with David Kapralik.</ref>

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and [[phencyclidine|PCP]].<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94\xe2\x80\x9398.</ref> As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122.</ref> recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" / "[[Everybody Is a Star]]", released in December 1969.  "Thank You" reached the top of the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100 in February 1970.<ref name="BillboardCharts" />

=== 1970\xe2\x80\x931971 interregnum ===
In 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs.<ref name="SlyAddiction">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 113\xe2\x80\x93115.</ref> He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band\'s concerts that year.<ref name=MTVNews>{{cite news| last=Aswad| first=Jem| date=February 10, 2006 | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524032/20060209/story.jhtml | title= Who, Exactly, Is Sly Stone?

Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward "Eddie Chin" Elliott and [[Mafia|Mafioso]] J.R. Valtrano to be Sly\'s bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 99\xe2\x80\x93100, 150\xe2\x80\x93152.</ref> A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band;<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 146\xe2\x80\x93147.</ref> in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by [[Andy Newmark]] in 1973.

To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. \'\'A Whole New Thing\'\' was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone\'s most popular recordings were packaged into the band\'s first \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Sly and the Family Stone)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' album. \'\'Greatest Hits\'\' reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] in 1970.

During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with [[Atlantic Records]], resulting in his own imprint, Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B Top 10 singles by Little Sister: "You\'re the One" and "Somebody\'s Watching You", a cover of a song from \'\'Stand!\'\'. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister\'s "Somebody\'s Watching You" is the first popular recording to feature the use of a [[drum machine]] for its rhythm track.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 74.</ref>

=== \'\'There\'s a Riot Goin\' On\'\' (1971) ===
In 1971, Sly and the Family Stone returned with a new single, "[[Family Affair (1971 song)|Family Affair]]", which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. "Family Affair" was the lead single from the band\'s long-awaited \'\'[[There\'s a Riot Goin\' On]]\'\'. The album debuted at number-one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' album charts upon its November 1971 release.
[[File:Stone3.jpg|200px|left|thumb|"The Original Family Stone", live in concert at Red Rock Resort in Las Vegas, 2006. Jerry Martini, Rose Stone, and Cynthia Robinson.]]
Instead of the bright, cheery rock-laced soul that had represented the optimistic 1960s, \'\'There\'s a Riot Goin\' On\'\' was an urban [[blues]], filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s.<ref>Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 74\xe2\x80\x9375.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Greil |authorlink=Greil Marcus |title=Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock\'n\'Roll Music |edition=4 |year=1997 |origyear=1975 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=0-452-27836-8 |page=72 }}</ref> The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss \xe2\x80\x93 the result of Sly\'s extensive re-recording and [[overdubbing]] during production.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 115\xe2\x80\x93117.</ref> Allegedly, most of the album\'s instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as [[Billy Preston]], [[Ike Turner]], and [[Bobby Womack]] for others.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 115; interview with Stephen Paley.</ref> "(You Caught Me) Smilin\'" and "Runnin\' Away" were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts.

After the release of \'\'Riot\'\', additional lineup changes took place. In early 1972, Jerry Martini inquired to Sly and his managers about monies due to him; saxophonist [[Pat Rizzo]] was hired as a potential replacement for Martini if he ever became suspicious of the band\'s business practices again.<ref name="Rizzo">Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 134.</ref> Both Rizzo and Martini remained in the band.<ref name="Rizzo" /> Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post-concert brawl broke out between Graham\'s entourage and Sly\'s entourage; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired a [[contract killing|hit man]] to kill Sly, assaulted Graham\'s associates.<ref name="LarrysExit">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 150\xe2\x80\x93154.</ref> Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety.<ref name="LarrysExit" /> Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to start [[Graham Central Station]], a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone.<ref name="LarryBass" /> Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-old [[Rusty Allen]].<ref name="LarrysExit" />

=== \'\'Fresh\'\' (1973) and \'\'Small Talk\'\' (1974) ===
Despite the loss of the original rhythm section and Sly\'s escalating cocaine use, the band\'s next album, \'\'[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]\'\', was released in 1973. By this time, Sly\'s sound had become more stripped down, yet more [[syncopation|syncopated]] and rhythmically complex.<ref name="ErlewineFresh">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

=== Dissolution ===

During the 1970s, Sly or one of the band members would often miss the gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use.

Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham\'s group, [[Graham Central Station]], for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for \'\'[[Back on the Right Track]]\'\', he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo.

== Sly Stone\'s later career ==
{{main|Sly Stone}}
Sly recorded two more albums for Epic: \'\'[[High on You]]\'\' (1975) and \'\'[[Heard You Missed Me, Well I\'m Back]]\'\' (1976). \'\'High On You\'\' was billed as a Sly Stone solo album; \'\'Heard You Missed Me\'\' was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate with some of the original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists [[Lynn Mabry]] and [[Dawn Silva]], who parted with Sly in 1976 and formed [[The Brides of Funkenstein]] in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released \'\'10 Years Too Soon\'\', a [[remix]] album featuring [[disco]] versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.

Sly signed with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] and recorded \'\'[[Back on the Right Track]]\'\' (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable to return to the success of his late \'60s and early \'70s fame.<ref name="ErlewineSly" /> He toured with [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album \'\'[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]\'\'. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981.<ref name="AintBut">Birchmeier, Jason. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r50298|pure_url=yes}} Review of \'\'Ain\'t But the One Way\'\' by Sly and the Family Stone]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on 2007-02-04.</ref> When Sly disappeared into self-seclusion, producer [[Stewart Levine]] completed the album, which was released as \'\'[[Ain\'t But the One Way]]\'\' in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on \'\'[[Late Night With David Letterman]]\'\' that year.<ref name="AintBut" /> Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone disappeared from the limelight and entered drug rehabilitation in 1984, at the insistence of his old friend Bobby Womack.<ref name=womack>{{cite news | last = Wilkinson | first = Peter | title = Sly\'s Strange Comeback | work = Rolling Stone | date = February 24, 2006 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9384446/slys_strange_comeback | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref> Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.

In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]\'s dance compilation album, \'\'[[Red Hot + Dance]]\'\', contributing an original track,"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix)."  The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

On August 16, 2011, the album \'\'[[I\'m Back! Family & Friends]]\'\' was released. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly and the Family Stone\'s greatest hits with guest appearances from [[Jeff Beck]], [[Ray Manzarek]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Carmine Appice]], and [[Johnny Winter]], as well as three previously unreleased songs.

One month later, on September 25, 2011, the New York Post reported that Sly Stone was now homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: "The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where \'Boyz n the Hood\' was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house."<ref>{{cite web|last=Alkema|first=Willem|title=Funk legend Sly Stone homeless and living in a van in LA|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/the_rise_and_fall_of_sly_stone_qijyKoYzmAqer1PA0YogSJ|work=New York Post|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>

== Awards and tributes ==
Sly and the Family Stone were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. The original members of the Family Stone were in attendance, except Sly. Just as the band took the podium to receive their awards, Sly suddenly appeared. He accepted his award, made some very brief remarks ("See you soon"), and disappeared from public view.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slythefamilystone/articles/story/7567410/sly_stone_joins_family |title=Sly Stone Joins Family |last=Bradbury |first=Andrew Paine |work=Rolling Stone |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=2009-11-14 }}</ref> In December 2001, Sly and the Family Stone were awarded the R&B Foundation Pioneer Award. Two Family Stone songs, "Dance to the Music" and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Again)", are among [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\'s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2004, \'\'[[Rolling Stone]]\'\' magazine ranked them 43rd on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Immortals: The First Fifty | work = Rolling Stone Issue 946 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>

A Sly and the Family Stone [[tribute album]], \'\'[[Different Strokes by Different Folks]]\'\', was released on July 12, 2005 by [[Starbucks]]\' Hear Music label. The project features [[cover version]]s of the band\'s songs, songs which [[sampling (music)|sample]] the original recordings, and songs that do both. The artists included [[The Roots]] ("Star", which samples "Everybody Is a Star"), [[Maroon 5]] ("[[Everyday People (song)|Everyday People]]"), [[John Legend]], [[Joss Stone]] & [[Van Hunt]] ("[[Family Affair (1971 song)|Family Affair]]"); the Black Eyed Peas\' [[will.i.am]] ("Dance to the Music"), and [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Robert Randolph & the Family Band|Robert Randolph]] ("[[I Want to Take You Higher]]"). Epic Records\' version of the tribute album (with two additional covers: "Don\'t Call Me Nigger, Whitey" and "Thank You (Faletinme Be Mice Elf Again)") was released on February 7, 2006.  The version of "Family Affair" won the 2007 R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Grammy.<ref>[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx 49th Annual Grammy Awards Winners List.] Grammy.com.

=== 2006 Grammy Awards tribute ===
A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006|2006 Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2006. The original plan, to have been a surprise for audiences, was to feature a reunion performance by the original Sly and the Family Stone lineup as the highlight of the tribute. However, the Grammy Award show\'s producers were worried that Sly Stone, who missed some of the rehearsals and belatedly arrived for others, would miss the show.<ref name="AP2006">{{cite news| last=Coyle| first=Jake| date= February 8, 2006 | url= http://movies.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=215255 | title= Reclusive Sly Stone Steps Out at Grammys| publisher=MSN.com | accessdate=2007-02-01}}</ref>

The tribute began halfway through the Grammy Awards ceremony, and was introduced by comedian [[Dave Chappelle]]. It featured [[Nile Rodgers]], Joss Stone, Van Hunt, and [[John Legend]] performing "Family Affair"; [[Fantasia Barrino|Fantasia]] and [[Devin Lima]] performing "If You Want Me to Stay"; [[Adam Levine]] and [[Ciara]] performing "Everyday People"; will.i.am performing "Dance to the Music"; and Steven Tyler and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of [[Aerosmith]] with Robert Randolph performing "I Want to Take You Higher".<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas (2006).

After the first half of "I Want to Take You Higher", the Family Stone took the stage alongside the other musicians, and Tyler called backstage "Hey, Sly; let\'s do it the way we used to do it!" Sporting a blonde [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] hairdo, sunglasses, and a silver [[lam\xc3\xa9 (fabric)|lam\xc3\xa9]] suit, Sly Stone emerged and contributed vocals and keyboards to a continuation of "I Want To Take You Higher." Three minutes into the performance, Sly tossed a wave to the audience and exited the stage, leaving the Family Stone and the guest performers to complete the number alone.<ref name="AP2006" />

Sly\'s unusual appearance and brief performance garnered highly mixed reviews and was covered throughout the press. An [[Associated Press]] report referred to Sly as the "[[J. D. Salinger]] of funk" and simply referred to the performance as being "bizarre".<ref name="AP2006"/> [[MTV News]] was much less complimentary: "The Grammy performance\xe2\x80\x94Sly\'s first with the original Family Stone since 1971\xe2\x80\x94was a halting, confused affair and a complete disservice to his music."<ref name=MTVNews>{{cite news| last=Aswad| first=Jem | date= February 10, 2006 | url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524032/20060209/story.jhtml | title= Who, Exactly, Is Sly Stone?

\'\'\'Franklyn Leon "Frankie" Smith\'\'\' (born 1953, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] [[musician]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[Soul music|soul]] [[songwriter]]. He is best known for his 1981 single "[[Double Dutch Bus]]".

==History==
He went to college in Tennessee for elementary education with a minor in music. He became a writer for funk and [[soul music|soul]] artists such as the [[The O\'Jays|O\'Jays]] and [[The Spinners (U.S. band)|The Spinners]]. He has also been influential in the careers of the [[rapper]]s [[Tone L\xc5\x8dc]], [[Ice Cube]] and [[Snoop Dogg]].

With his 1981 single "[[Double Dutch Bus]]", released by [[WMOT Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p192548/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Frankie Smith|last=Hogan|first=Ed|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> Smith popularized a nonsensical form of [[slang]], (From his song "Slang thang", 1981 WMOT records.) in which "iz" is placed in the middle of a word (for example, the word "place" becomes "pl\'\'iz\'\'ace") or the last letters of a word are replaced with "[[-izzle]]" (ex. sure becomes sh\'\'izzle\'\'). The style became part of [[hip-hop]] slang, and was popularized by rappers [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[E-40]]. The style today holds a place in popular slang.

"Double Dutch Bus" itself has been [[sample (music)|sampled]] frequently in hip-hop, including Snoop Dogg\'s "Snoop Dogg (What\'s My Name, Pt. 2)" and [[Missy Elliott]]\'s "[[Gossip Folks]]". Both records were produced by [[Timbaland]]. His single "Double Dutch Bus" is also featured in the 2008 [[Disney]] [[movie]] \'\'[[College Road Trip]]\'\' starring [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Raven-Symon\xc3\xa9]].

A native Philadelphian, Smith once applied to be a bus driver for the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority]] (SEPTA), which operates Philadelphia\'s public transit system, but SEPTA turned him down. The "Transpass" referred to by Smith in "Double Dutch Bus" is an actual monthly fare pass issued by SEPTA.

==Early years==
There is confusion about Smith\'s birth year, with various sources citing either 1925 or 1928. Born James Oscar Smith in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]], at the age of six he joined his father doing a song-and-dance routine in clubs. He began teaching himself to play the piano. When he was nine, Smith won a Philadelphia radio talent contest as a boogie-woogie pianist.<ref name="50great">{{cite web|title=50 great moments in jazz: Jimmy Smith and the Hammond organ|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2010/jun/02/jimmy-smith-hammond-organ|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=18 April 2011|author=John Fordham|date=June 2, 2010}}</ref>  After a stint in the navy, he began furthering his musical education in 1948, with a year at [[Royal Hamilton College of Music]], then the [[Leo Ornstein]] School of Music in Philadelphia in 1949.  He began exploring the Hammond organ in 1951. From 1951 to 1954 he played piano, then organ in Philly R&B bands like [[Don Gardner]] and the Sonotones. He switched to organ permanently in 1954 after hearing [[Wild Bill Davis]].<ref name="50great"/><ref name=dicaire2006>{{cite book|last=Dicaire|first=David|title=Jazz musicians, 1945 to the present|year=2006|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-2097-9|pages=110\xe2\x80\x9313}}</ref><ref name=feather07>{{cite book|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=0-19-532000-X|page=611|author=Leonard Feather|author2=Ira Gitler}}</ref>

==Career==

He purchased his first Hammond organ, rented a warehouse to practice in and emerged after little more than a year. Upon hearing him playing in a Philadelphia club, Blue Note\'s Alfred Lion immediately signed him to the label and his second album, \'\'[[The Champ (Jimmy Smith album)|The Champ]]\'\', quickly established Smith as a new star on the jazz scene. He was a prolific recording artist and, as a leader, dubbed The Incredible Jimmy Smith, he recorded around forty sessions for [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] in just eight years beginning in 1956. Albums from this period include \'\'[[The Sermon!]]\'\', \'\'[[House Party (Jimmy Smith album)|House Party]]\'\', \'\'[[Home Cookin\' (album)|Home Cookin\']]\'\', \'\'[[Midnight Special (Jimmy Smith album)|Midnight Special]]\'\', \'\'[[Back at the Chicken Shack]]\'\' and \'\'[[Prayer Meetin\']]\'\'.

Smith signed to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] label in 1962. His first album, \'\'Bashin\'\'\', sold well and for the first time set Smith with a big band, led by [[Oliver Nelson]].  Further big band collaborations followed, most successfully with [[Lalo Schifrin]] for \'\'[[The Cat (album)|The Cat]]\'\' and guitarist [[Wes Montgomery]], with whom he recorded two albums: \'\'The Dynamic Duo\'\' and \'\'Further Adventures Of Jimmy and Wes\'\'. Other notable albums from this period include \'\'Blue Bash\'\' and \'\'[[Organ Grinder Swing]]\'\' with [[Kenny Burrell]], \'\'The Boss\'\' with [[George Benson]], \'\'Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\'\', \'\'[[Got My Mojo Working]]\'\', and \'\'Root Down\'\'.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Smith recorded with some of the great jazz musicians of the day such as [[Kenny Burrell]], [[George Benson]], [[Grant Green]], [[Stanley Turrentine]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Lou Donaldson]], [[Tina Brooks]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Grady Tate]] and [[Donald Bailey (musician)|Donald Bailey]].

The Jimmy Smith Trio performed "[[When Johnny Comes Marching Home]]" and "The Sermon" in the 1964 film \'\'[[Get Yourself a College Girl]].\'\'

In the 1970s, Smith opened his own [[supper club]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and played there regularly with guitarist Paul C Saenz, Kenny Dixon on drums, Herman Riley and John F. Phillips on saxophone; also included in the band was harmonica/flute player Stanley Behrens.  The 1972 album \'\'[[Root Down (album)|Root Down]]\'\', considered a seminal influence on later generations of funk and hip-hop musicians, was recorded live at the club, albeit with a different group of backing musicians.

==Later career==

[[Holle Thee Maxwell]], then known as Holly Maxwell, was Smith\'s vocalist for two years in the late 1970s.  During a South African tour, they recorded the album, \'\'Jimmy Plays for the People\'\' in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://collectorsfrenzy.com/details/260961298412/JIMMY_SMITH_PLAYS_FOR_THE_PEOPLE__RARE_SOUTH_AFRICAN_ONLY_LP_WITH_PROGRAM|title=Jimmy Smith Plays for the People: Rare South African - only LP with program |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= February 19, 2012 |website= collectorsfrenzy.com |publisher= 2013 CollectorsFrenzy |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>

Smith had a career revival in the 1980s and 1990s, again recording for Blue Note and Verve, and for [[Milestone Records|Milestone]] and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. Smith also recorded with other artists including Quincy Jones/Frank Sinatra, [[Michael Jackson]] (he plays on the title track of the \'\'[[Bad (album)|Bad]]\'\' album), [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] and [[Joey DeFrancesco]].

His last major album, \'\'[[Dot Com Blues]]\'\' (Verve/Blue Thumb, 2001), featured many special guests such as [[Dr. John]], [[B. B. King]] and [[Etta James]].

Smith and his wife Lola moved to [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in 2004, but Lola died of cancer a few months later.<ref name=wpost /> Smith later recorded an album, \'\'Legacy\'\', with Joey DeFrancesco, and the two began preparation to go on tour.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Smith Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-Ra-Z/Smith-Jimmy.html|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>  However, before this could happen, Smith was found dead on February 8, 2005, at his Scottsdale home by his manager, Robert Clayton.<ref name=wpost>{{cite news|title=Jazz Musician Jimmy Smith, Master Organist, Dies at 76|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/AFeb10.html|accessdate=23 April 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 February 2005|author=Joe Holley}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> He was deemed to have died in his sleep of natural causes.

==Musical style==
[[File:Jimmy Smith American Jazz Organist photo by Jon Hammond 2005.jpg|thumb|Jimmy Smith in 2005]]

While the electric organ had been used in jazz by [[Fats Waller]], [[Count Basie]], Wild Bill Davis and others, Smith\'s virtuoso [[improvisation]] technique on the Hammond helped to popularize the electric organ as a jazz and blues instrument.  The B3 and companion [[Leslie speaker]] produce a distinctive sound, including percussive "clicks" with each key stroke. The drawbar setting most commonly associated with Smith is to pull out the first three drawbars on the "B" preset on the top manual of the organ, with added harmonic percussion on the 3rd harmonic. This tone has been emulated by many jazz organists since Smith. Smith\'s style on fast tempo pieces combined bluesy "licks" with [[bebop]]-based single note runs.  For ballads, he played walking bass lines on the bass pedals. For uptempo tunes, he would play the bass line on the lower manual and use the pedals for emphasis on the attack of certain notes, which helped to emulate the attack and sound of a [[string bass]].

Smith influenced a constellation of [[List of jazz organists|jazz organists]], including [[Jimmy McGriff]], [[Brother Jack McDuff]], [[Don Patterson (organist)|Don Patterson]], [[Richard "Groove" Holmes]], [[Joey DeFrancesco]] and [[Larry Goldings]], as well as [[rock music|rock]] keyboardists such as [[Jon Lord]], [[Brian Auger]] and [[Keith Emerson]]. Later, he influenced bands such as [[Medeski, Martin & Wood]], the [[Hayden-Eckert Ensemble]] and the [[Beastie Boys]], who sampled the bassline from "Root Down (and Get It)" from \'\'[[Root Down (album)|Root Down]]\'\'\xe2\x80\x94and saluted Smith in the lyrics\xe2\x80\x94for their own hit "Root Down". Often called the father of [[acid jazz]], Smith lived to see that movement come to reflect his organ style. In the 1990s, Smith went to Nashville, taking a break from his ongoing gigs at his Sacramento restaurant which he owned and, in Music City, Nashville, he produced, with the help of a webmaster, \'\'Dot Com Blues\'\', his last Verve album.
In 1999, Smith guested on two tracks of a live album, \'\'Incredible!\'\', the hit from the 1960s, with his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, Joey DeFrancesco, a then 28-year-old organist. Smith and DeFrancesco\'s collaborative album \'\'Legacy\'\' was released in 2005 shortly after Smith\'s death.<ref name=aaj>{{cite web|title=Joey DeFrancesco with Jimmy Smith: Legacy (2005)|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=17933|publisher=All About Jazz|accessdate=23 April 2012|author=Ollie Bivens|date=21 June 2005}}</ref>

\'\'\'The Soul Rebels\'\'\' (also \'\'\'Soul Rebels Brass Band\'\'\', \'\'\'Soul Rebels\'\'\' or \'\'\'The Rebels\'\'\') are an eight-piece [[New Orleans]] based brass ensemble that incorporate elements of [[Soul music|soul]], [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] within a contemporary brass band framework. The band grew from their New Orleans brass style out of original members Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss\xe2\x80\x99s shared desire to play the music they heard on the radio but with respect to the New Orleans brass band tradition.

Starting out as a local New Orleans favorite, The Soul Rebels have evolved into collaborating live with artists including [[Metallica]], [[Green Day]], [[Rakim]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Joey Badass]], [[Trombone Shorty]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Black Thought]] of [[The Roots]], [[Prodigy (rapper)]] of [[Mobb Deep]], [[Big Freedia]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[Styles P]] of [[The Lox]], [[Maceo Parker]], [[Galactic]], [[Suzanne Vega]], [[David A.

The band has built its career around an eclectic live show that harnesses the power of horns and percussion in a funky party-like atmosphere. The Soul Rebels have performed on [[CBS]], [[Discovery Channel]], [[HBO]], [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]], [[NBC]], [[NPR]], [[ESPN]], [[BBC Two]], [[The CW]] and on many major national and international stages.<ref name="Soul Rebels main bio">{{cite web|url=http://soulrebelsbrassband.com/about/|title=Soul Rebels|publisher=Soulrebelsbrassband.com|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref>  The band routinely plays over 250 shows a year.

The Soul Rebels have been described by the \'\'[[Village Voice]]\'\' as \xe2\x80\x9cthe missing link between [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Louis Armstrong]].\xe2\x80\x9d<ref name="Soul Rebels Brass Band">{{cite web|title=Soul Rebels Bio|url=http://soulrebelsbrassband.com/unlock-your-mind/|publisher=Soulrebelsbrassband.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

The Soul Rebels consist of percussionists and founding members Lumar LeBlanc and Derrick Moss, trumpet players Julian Gosin and Marcus Hubbard, trombonists Corey Peyton and Paul Robertson, saxophonist Erion Williams, and sousaphonist Edward Lee Jr.

==Early History==
The band first began when percussionists Derrick Moss and Lumar LeBlanc met as members of [[Harold Dejan]]\'s [[Young Olympia Brass Band]] and decided they wanted to play the music they were hearing on pop radio, but within the context and with respect to the long tradition of the New Orleans brass bands and marching bands they had grown up playing in. The Soul Rebels played around New Orleans without a proper band name until opening up for [[Cyril Neville]] at the legendary New Orleans venue [[Tipitina\'s]], where [[Cyril Neville]] dubbed them \xe2\x80\x9cSoul Rebels.\xe2\x80\x9d<ref name=Youtube.com>{{cite web|title=The Soul Rebels: Unlock Your Mind EPK (Extended)|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIpQh571guA|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>  The Soul Rebels built up their following in hometown New Orleans as the house band every Thursday night at local favorite bar Le Bon Temps Roule, a residency they still continue currently when the band isn\xe2\x80\x99t on tour.<ref name="Gonola.com">{{cite web|title=Soul Rebels at Le Bon Temps Roule|url=http://www.gonola.com/2010/07/05/the-names-says-it-all-at-le-bon-temps-roule.html|publisher=Gonola.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>  The band is still considered a main drawing point for people to come experience the venue.<ref name="Soul Rebels Brass Band">{{cite web|url=http://soulrebelsbrassband.com/unlock-your-mind/|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref>

Since 2009, The Soul Rebels have been managed by music industry heavyweight Ted Kurland, proprietor of the prestigious booking and management agency Ted Kurland Associates, Adam Shipley, president of Hep Cat Entertainment and Alex Kurland of the Blue Note Entertainment Group.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2012/01/the_soul_rebels_seek_to_unlock.html |title= The Soul Rebels seek to \'Unlock Your Mind\' |accessdate=2012-07-08 |last= Spera |first= Keith |coauthors= |date= January 27, 2012|publisher=Nola.com}}</ref>

\'\'\'Stonefunkers\'\'\' is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[funk]], [[go-go]] and live [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] band started by brothers Emrik and Torsten Larsson that was one of the first Swedish bands to play "urban"-style music.<ref name=SvD>[http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/stonefunkers-aterupptar-festandet_2676501.svd "Stonefunkers \xc3\xa5terupptar festandet",] \'\'SvD\'\' 31 March 2009.

==Career==
Both Larssons spent a year in the USA studying American culture and also picking up on the Soul and funk scene.<ref name=Emrik>[http://www.emrik.nu/visa.lasso?mall=popupsangtext.lasso&kat_id=&ukat_id=&poster_id=8000000000030175 Emrik Larsson] at stonefunkers.com. Retrieved 21 March 2010.</ref>

Emrik went to high school in [[Rochester, New York]] and soon found out that a lot of the hot bands usually stopped to play in Rochester. During his year he got to see artists ranging from [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] with [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[D Train (music group)|D-Train]], [[Tyrone Brunson (musician)|Tyrone Brunson]], to [[Slave (band)|Slave]] and [[Steve Arrington]] and also witnessed his first hip hop performance by [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]] (known through the hip hop movie \'\'[[Wild Style]]\'\').<ref name=Bio>[http://www.stonefunkers.com/visa.lasso?ukat_id=8000000000039991&kat_id=84500000000012190&kunder_id=8000000000000680&mall=1-spalt.lasso Stonefunkers biography - 1998] at stonefunkers.com.

Back in Sweden they both felt the urge to start a funk band. Torsten had previously played the bass in various [[Punk rock|punk]]/rock bands, and Emrik had done some singing in different choirs and also had a leading part in a musical.<ref name=Bio/>

They recruited their old [[skateboard]] pal Christian on drums, a neighbour on bass, Emrik\xe2\x80\x99s friend David on Moog and Prophet synthesizers, and Torsten switched to [[guitar]].
Torsten came up with the name during a skate session.<ref name=Emrik/><ref name=Karas/>

In 1987 they became the first Swedish band to be interviewed on the Swedish radio show Soul Corner, a radio program covering African-American music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydsvenskan.se/kultur-och-nojen/article32259/Svart-musik-pa-skanska.html |title=Svart musik p\xc3\xa5 sk\xc3\xa5nska - Kultur & N\xc3\xb6jen - Sydsvenskan - Nyheter dygnet runt |publisher=Sydsvenskan.se |date=2005-04-22 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>

The early Stonefunk sound was guitar-driven rock funk influenced by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Rose Royce]] and [[Sly Stone]]. In 1987 they were considered one of [[Gothenburg]]\xe2\x80\x99s most energetic and exciting live bands and they recorded their first single, "Turn it Up", released in May 1988 on small indie label Radium.<ref name=Bio/>

In autumn 1989 they started to work on their first full-length album, \'\'Hard as Kryptonite\'\', with producer [[Christian Falk]] <ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Malmqvist |url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/christian-falk-tar-ton-pa-nya-skivan_359188.svd |title=Christian Falk tar ton p\xc3\xa5 nya skivan &#124; Kulturnyheter &#124; SvD |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> (later known for his work with [[Neneh Cherry]], \'\'Blacknuss all-stars\'\' and [[Robyn]]).

Stonefunkers lineup 1989:
*Vocals - Emrik (M-rock) Larsson,
*Guitar - Torsten (Topsteen) Larsson,
*Moog - David (Davono) Selvert
*Drums - Christian (Cheeze) Ekerfors
*Percussion - [[Jean-Louis Huhta]]
*Rap - Daniel ([[Papa Dee]]) Wahlgren
*Bass - Magnus (Conan) Corneliusson.

In 1990 the group switched labels to [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], who decided to [[remix]] \'\'Hard as Kryptonite\'\' for an international release entitled \'\'Harder than Kryptonite\'\'. This remixed version of the album had a jazz-hip hop/[[Native Tongues]] direction and new added rap verses. [[Papa Dee]] also left the band and embarked on a solo career. The band decided to recruit rapper \'\'MC Cane\'\' (Marc Eastmond), with whom they recorded a brand new [[De La Soul]]-inspired new single entitled "Can U Follow". The song became a huge dance-floor hit and the video was shown on [[MTV]] Europe on a regular basis. The album \'\'Harder than Kryptonite\'\' was released all around Europe in 1991 and Stonefunkers also embarked on their first European tour, visiting the Nordic countries and Germany.<ref name=Bio/>

With \'\'MC Cane\'\' still the main rapper the band recorded the  12" singel \'\'LPC ([[Lucky People Center]])\'\', a celebration of percussionist [[Jean-Louis Huhta]] club nights <ref name="wordpress1"/> of the same name.

In 1992 they started to work on their next album with producer [[Henryk Lipp]].

The album \'\'No problem \xe2\x80\x9994 (non-believers stand back!)\'\' was a huge hit in the spring of \xe2\x80\x9993 and spawned two big hit singles, "M-rock theory" and "Funkadeena".<ref name=Emrik/>

The recording stint with Warner came to an end in 1994 and Stonefunkers were signed to [[Stockholm Records]] subsidiary Breakin\xe2\x80\x99 Bread. They recorded the next album in [[Haarlem]], the [[Netherlands]] and also toured the [[Benelux]] countries extensively.<ref name=Bio/> The effort made in the Netherlands came out in the form of a \'\'Material\'\'-heavy [[P-funk]]-influenced album. The album contained the singles "Wreck the show" and "Individuality" but never made an impact in [[Sweden]]. The response to the album was greater abroad and Stonefunkers embarked on yet another tour that took them to [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and other countries.<ref name=Emrik/>

In 1996 ADL left the band to work on his solo project \'\'Absent Minded\'\',<ref>[http://www.shell.linux.se/popoga/a/a00023.html ADL, Absent-Minded]</ref> and the band decided to continue without a rapper and instead put more focus on the vocals of lead singer Emrik \xe2\x80\x9dM-rock\xe2\x80\x9d Larsson.<ref name=Bio/> In 1998 Stonefunkers signed a deal with Swedish label Independent Records and immediately began putting down tracks for the new album.

\'\'\'Sly Stone\'\'\' (born \'\'\'Sylvester Stewart\'\'\', March 15, 1943, [[Denton, Texas]]) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer, most famous for his role as frontman for [[Sly and the Family Stone]], a band which played a critical role in the development of soul, [[funk]] and [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] in the 1960s and \'70s.  In 1993, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/sly-and-the-family-stone/timeline/ |title=Sly and the Family Stone &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
The Stewart family was a deeply religious middle-class household from Denton, Texas.

As part of the doctrines of the [[Church of God in Christ]] (COGIC), to which the Stewart family belonged, the parents - K.C and Alpha Stewart - encouraged musical expression in the household.<ref>[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]] (1998). \'\'For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History\'\'. New York: Quill Publishing. ISBN 0-380-79377-6.
</ref>

Born March 15, 1943,<ref name="Santiago">Santiago, Eddie. \'\'Sly: The Lives of Sylvester Stewart and Sly Stone\'\'. Eddie Santiago, 2008. Print.</ref> before the family had moved from [[Denton, Texas]] to [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], in the northern [[San Francisco Bay Area]], Sylvester was the second of the family\'s five children.

Sylvester and his brother [[Freddie Stone|Freddie]] along with their sisters [[Rosie Stone|Rose]] and [[Vet Stone|Vaetta]] formed "The Stewart Four" as children, performing [[gospel music]] in the [[Church of God in Christ]] and even recording a single local release 78 rpm single, "On the Battlefield" b/w "Walking in Jesus\' Name", in 1952.

The eldest sister, Loretta, was the only Stewart child not to pursue a musical career. All of the other Stewart children would later adopt the surname "Stone" and become members of Sly & the Family Stone.

Sylvester was identified as a musical prodigy from a young age. By the time he was seven, Sylvester had already become proficient on the keyboards, and by the age of eleven, he had mastered the guitar, bass, and drums as well.<ref name="Santiago"/>

While still in high school, Sylvester had settlled primarily on the guitar, and joined a number of high school bands.

One of these was The Viscaynes, a [[doo-wop]] group, in which Sylvester and his friend, Frank Arelano - who was [[Philippines|Filipino]] - were the only non-white members.

The fact that the group was integrated made the Viscaynes "hip" in the eyes of their audiences, and would later inspire Sylvester\'s idea of the multicultural "Family Stone".

The Viscaynes released a few local singles, including "Yellow Moon" and "Stop What You Are"; during the same period, Sylvester also recorded a few solo singles under the name Danny Stewart.

With his brother, Fred, he formed several short-lived groups, like the Stewart Bros.<ref name=RSbio>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/slythefamilystone/biography "Sly & The Family Stone."] \'\'Rolling Stone\'\'. Web.</ref>

The nickname Sly was a common one for Sylvester throughout his years in grade school. Early on, a classmate misspelt his name "Slyvester," and ever since, the nickname followed him.<ref name="Santiago"/>

In the mid-1960s, Stone worked as a disc jockey for San Francisco, California soul radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones into his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a staff record producer for [[Autumn Records]], producing for San Francisco-area bands such as [[The Beau Brummels]], [[The Mojo Men]], [[Bobby Freeman]], and [[Grace Slick]]\'s first band, the [[Great Society]].

Adopting the stage name "Sly Stone," he then formed "The Stoners" in 1966 which included [[Cynthia Robinson]] on trumpet. With her he started his next band, Sly and the Family Stone. Stone, Robinson, and Fred Stewart were joined by [[Larry Graham]], Greg Errico, and Jerry Martini, all of whom had studied music and worked in numerous amateur groups.

Working around the Bay Area in 1967, this multiracial band made a strong impression. On the first recordings [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]]: [[Vet Stone]], Mary McCreary, and Elva Mouton did backup vocals.<ref name=RSbio/> In 1968 sister [[Rosie Stone]] (piano and vocals) joined the band.

Stone was influential in guiding KSOL-AM into soul music and started calling the station K-SOUL. The second was a popular [[soul music]] station (sans the K-SOUL moniker), at 107.7 FM (now known as [[KSAN-FM|KSAN]]). The current KSOL has a different format and is unrelated to the previous two stations.

===Sly and the Family Stone\'s success===
Along with [[James Brown]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]] were pioneers of late 1960s and early \'70s funk. Their fusion of [[R&B]] rhythms, infectious melodies, and psychedelia created a new pop/soul/rock hybrid the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread. [[Motown]] producer [[Norman Whitfield]], for example, patterned the label\'s forays into harder-driving, socially relevant material (such as [[The Temptations]]\' "Runaway Child" and "[[Ball of Confusion]]") based on their sound. The pioneering precedent of Stone\'s racial, sexual, and stylistic mix, had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Rick James]]. Legions of artists from the 1990s forward \xe2\x80\x93 including [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Beck]], [[Beastie Boys]] and [[LL Cool J]]\'s popular "Mama Said Knock You Out" along with many others \xe2\x80\x93 mined Stone\'s seminal back catalog for hook-laden samples.<ref name=RSbio/>

"The most talented musician I know is Sly Stone," [[Bootsy Collins]] told \'\'[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]\'\' magazine (March 2002 issue). "He\'s more talented than anybody I ever have seen \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s amazing. I worked with him in Detroit from 1981 to \'83, and to see him just fooling around, playing, jamming, is a whole other trip. He\'s the most amazing musician."

After a mildly received debut album, \'\'[[A Whole New Thing (Sly and the Family Stone album)|A Whole New Thing]]\'\' (1967), Sly & The Family Stone had their first hit single with "[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]", which was later included on an [[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|album of the same name]] (1968).  Although their third album, \'\'[[Life (Sly & the Family Stone album)|Life]]\'\' (also 1968), also suffered from low sales, their fourth album, \'\'[[Stand!]]\'\' (1969), became a runaway success, selling over three million copies and spawning a number one hit single, "[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]".  By the summer of 1969, Sly & The Family Stone were one of the biggest names in music, releasing two more top five singles, "[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]" and "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" / "[[Everybody Is a Star]]", before the end of the year, and appearing at [[Woodstock festival|Woodstock]].

From the moment the group began touring following the success of \'\'[[Dance to the Music (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Dance to the Music]]\'\', The Family Stone drew praise for their explosive live show, which attracted equal parts black and white fans. When [[Bob Marley]] first played in the U.S. in 1973 with his band The Wailers, he opened on tour for [[Sly and The Family Stone]].

===Personal problems and decline===
With the band\'s newfound fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146\xe2\x80\x93152</ref> [[Epic Records|Epic]] requested more marketable output.<ref name="Kaliss">* Kaliss, Jeff (2008). \'\'I Want to Take You Higher: The Life and Times of Sly & the Family Stone\'\'.

After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily [[cocaine]] and [[phencyclidine|PCP]].<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94\xe2\x80\x9398</ref> As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122</ref> recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, "[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]" / "[[Everybody Is a Star]]", released in December 1969. The former song was one of the first recordings to employ the heavy, funky beats that would be featured in the [[funk]] music of the following decade. It showcased bass player [[Larry Graham]]\'s innovative percussive playing technique of bass "[[Slapping (music)|slapping]]". Graham later said that he developed this technique in an earlier band in order to compensate for that band\'s lack of a drummer.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/larrygraham/articles/story/5920205/bass_legend_graham_lays_down_the_millennial_funk Bass Legend Graham Lays Down the Millennial Funk: Larry Graham]. \'\'Rolling Stone.\'\' Retrieved October 25, 2008.</ref>

"Thank You" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. The single also peaked at #5 on the R&B chart and remained there for five weeks, while also remaining at #1 on the Pop chart for two weeks in the spring of 1970, before selling over a million copies.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t4149693|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)].

Having relocated to Los Angeles with his then girlfriend Deborah King, later Deborah Santana (wife of [[Carlos Santana]] from 1973 until filing for divorce in 2007), Stone\'s behavior became increasingly erratic. Epic was anticipating new material in 1970, but with none forthcoming, finally released \'\'[[Greatest Hits (Sly & the Family Stone)|Greatest Hits]]\'\' that November. One year later, the band\'s fifth album, \'\'[[There\'s a Riot Goin\' On]]\'\', was released. \'\'Riot\'\' featured a much darker sound as most tracks were recorded with overdubbing as opposed to The Family Stone all playing at the same time as they had done previously. Stone played most of the parts himself and performed more of the lead vocals than usual. This was the first major label album to feature a [[drum machine]].

The band\'s cohesion slowly began to erode, and its sales and popularity began to decline as well. Errico withdrew from the group in 1971 and was eventually replaced with [[Andy Newmark]]. Larry Graham and Stone were no longer on friendly terms, and Graham was fired in early 1972 and replaced with [[Rustee Allen]]. The band\'s later releases, \'\'[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]\'\' (1973) and \'\'[[Small Talk (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Small Talk]]\'\' (1974), featured even less of the band and more of Stone.

Live bookings for Sly & the Family Stone had steadily dropped since 1970, because promoters were afraid that Stone or one of the band members might miss the gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use.<ref name="EndofFamily">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 141\xe2\x80\x93145</ref> These issues were regular occurrences for the band during the 1970s, and had an adverse effect on their ability to demand money for live bookings.<ref name="EndofFamily" /> At many of these gigs, concertgoers rioted if the band failed to show up, or if Stone walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group\'s promoter, and later their general manager, when no other representatives would work with the band because of their erratic gig attendance record.<ref>Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 186\xe2\x80\x93189.</ref> In January 1975, the band booked itself at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. The famed music hall was only one-eighth occupied, and Stone and company had to scrape together money to return home.<ref name="TheEnd">Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 188\xe2\x80\x93191.</ref> Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved.<ref name="TheEnd" />

Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was by then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham\'s group, [[Graham Central Station]], for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for \'\'[[Back on the Right Track]]\'\', he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in [[Vallejo, California]]. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married [[Leon Russell]] and released recordings on Russell\'s Shelter Records label.<ref>Ankeny, Jason.

===Later years===
Stone went on to record four more albums as a solo artist (only \'\'[[High on You]]\'\' (1975) was released under just his name; the other three were released under the "Sly & The Family Stone" name). In 1976, Stone assembled a new Family Stone and released \'\'[[Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I\'m Back]]\'\'. 1979\'s \'\'[[Back on the Right Track]]\'\' followed, and in 1982 \'\'[[Ain\'t But the One Way]]\'\' was released, which began as a collaborative album with [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], but was scrapped and later completed by producer [[Stewart Levine]] for release. None of these later albums achieved much success.

Stone also collaborated with [[Funkadelic]] on \'\'[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]\'\' (1981), but was unable to reinvigorate his career. In the early 1980s Sly Stone was also part of a George Clinton/Funkadelic family project with [[Muruga Booker]] called "The Soda Jerks," who recorded an album worth of material, all of which has gone unreleased, except for one song, however Muruga has plans of still releasing the project.

In June 1983, Sly was arrested in Fort Myers, Fla., and charged with cocaine possession.

Stone managed to do a short tour with [[Bobby Womack]] in the summer of 1984, and he continued to make sporadic appearances on compilations and other artists\' records. In 1986, Stone was featured on a track from [[The Time (band)|The Time]] member Jesse Johnson\'s solo album \'\'Shockadelica\'\' called "Crazay". The music video featured Stone on keyboards and vocals, and received some airplay on the [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] music network.

In 1987, Stone released a single, "Eek-a-Boo Static Automatic", from the \'\'[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]\'\' soundtrack, and the song "I\'m the Burglar" from the \'\'[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]\'\' soundtrack. He also co-wrote and co-produced "Just Like A Teeter-Totter," which appeared on a [[Bar-Kays]] album from 1989.
From 1988 to 1989 Sly Stone wrote and produced a collection of unreleased recordings in his home studio in New Jersey, "Coming Back for More" and "Just Like A Teeter-Totter" are a part of that collection of about 20 songs.

In 1990, he gave an energetic vocal performance on the [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] song, "Good Time." In 1991, he appeared on a cover of "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)" performed by the Japanese band [[13CATS]], and shared lead vocals with Bobby Womack on "When the Weekend Comes" from Womack\'s 1993 album \'\'I Still Love You\'\'. His last major public appearance until 2006 was during the 1993 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony where Stone showed up onstage to be entered into the Hall of Fame along with the Family Stone. In 2003, the other six members of the original Family Stone entered the studio to record a new album. Stone was invited to participate, but declined.

"I feel like Sly just doesn\'t wanna deal with it no more," remarked [[Bootsy Collins]] in \'\'[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]\'\' magazine\'s March 2002 issue. "It\'s like he\'s had it \xe2\x80\x93 it ain\'t no fun no more. It\'s a curse and a blessing. The curse part of it is the business you have to deal with, and then the blessing part is you get to be a musician and have fun..."

A few home-studio recordings (most likely from the late 1980s) with Stone\'s voice and keyboards over a drum machine have made their way onto a bootleg. One Stone-penned demo called "Coming Back for More" appears to be autobiographical and includes the verse: "Been so high, I touched the sky and the sky says \'Sly, why you tryin\' to get by?\' Comin\' back for more." His son, Sylvester Jr., told [[People Magazine]] in 1997 that his father had composed an album\'s worth of material, including a tribute to [[Miles Davis]] called "Miles and Miles."

On August 15, 2005, Stone drove his younger sister [[Vet Stone]] on his motorcycle to Los Angeles\' [[Knitting Factory]], where Vet was performing with her Sly & the Family Stone [[tribute band]], the Phunk Phamily Affair. Stone kept his helmet on during the entire performance, and was described by one concertgoer as looking a little like [[Bootsy Collins]]. A film crew doing a documentary on Sly & the Family Stone was at the show and apparently captured this rare sighting on film. Stone, according to his web site, is producing and writing material for the group\'s new album. In addition, Stone renamed the group "Family Stone."

In 2009, the documentary film \'\'Coming Back for More\'\' detailed his dire financial situation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/18/sly-stone-living-on-welfare | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sean | last=Michaels | title=Sly Stone living on welfare, claims documentary | date=August 18, 2009}}</ref>

Stone filed suit against [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], the former manager of Sly and the Family Stone for $50 million in January 2010. The suit claims that Goldstein used fraudulent practices to convince him to deliver the rights to his songs to Goldstein. In the suit, he makes the same claim about the Sly and the Family Stone trademark.<ref>The Detroit Free Press, January 30, 2010, page 11A</ref> Goldstein filed a countersuit for slander following a rant by Stone at the [[Coachella Festival]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/09/sly-stone-homeless-sly-and-the-family-stone.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Ministry of Gossip | date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Mid 2000s tributes===
A Sly & the Family Stone tribute took place at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006|2006 Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2006, at which Stone gave his first live musical performance since 1987. Sly & the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included [[Steven Tyler]], [[John Legend]], [[Van Hunt]], [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]]. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a "Sly" beltbuckle and a silver lam\xc3\xa9 suit, he joined in on "I Want To Take You Higher." Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked to the front of the stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9384446/slys_strange_comeback |title=Sly\'s Strange Comeback |last=Wilkinson |first=Peter |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 24, 2006 |accessdate=September 9, 2009 }}</ref> "He went up the ramp [outside the theater], got on a motorcycle and took off," Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the \'\'[[Chicago Sun-Times]]\'\'.  Ehrlich said Stone refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began.

A Sly & The Family Stone [[tribute album]], \'\'[[Different Strokes by Different Folks]]\'\', was released on July 12, 2005 by [[Starbucks]]\' [[Hear Music]] label, and on February 7, 2006 by Epic Records. The project features both [[cover versions]] of the band\'s songs and songs which [[Sampling (music)|sample]] the original recordings. Among the artists for the set are [[The Roots]] ("Star", which samples "Everybody is a Star"), [[Maroon 5]] and [[Ciara]] ("[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]"), [[John Legend]], [[Joss Stone]] & [[Van Hunt]] ("[[Family Affair (1971 song)|Family Affair]]"), [[The Black Eyed Peas]]\' [[will.i.am]] ("Dance to the Music"), and [[Steven Tyler]], [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] and [[Robert Randolph & the Family Band|Robert Randolph]] ("[[I Want to Take You Higher]]"). [[Epic Records]]\' version of the tribute album, which included two additional covers ("Don\'t Call Me Nigger, Whitey" and "Thank You (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin)") was released in January 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7567410/sly_stone_joins_family |title=Sly Stone Joins Family |last=Bradbury |first=Andrew Paine |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=September 9, 2009 }}</ref>

===Re-emergence===
On Sunday, January 14, 2007 Stone made a short guest appearance at a show of The New Family Stone band he supports at the [[House of Blues]].

On April 1, 2007, Stone appeared with the Family Stone at the Flamingo Las Vegas Showroom, after [[George Wallace (comedian)|George Wallace]]\'s standup act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/do/2007/apr/02/566652378.html |title=Archive for April 2, 2007Las Vegas Sun |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |date=April 2, 2007 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>

On July 7, 2007 Stone made a short appearance with the Family Stone at the San Jose, CA Summerfest. He sang "Sing a Simple Song" and "If You Want Me to Stay," and walked off stage before the end of "Higher." He wore a baseball cap, dark glasses, a white hooded sweatshirt, baggy pants and gold chains. Stone, who took the stage at about 8:45&nbsp;p.m., cut the set short, in part, because the promoter was told that the show had to end by 9:00. The band began their set over 90 minutes late reportedly because the stage management was poor and the promoter\'s band played for 30 minutes longer than scheduled. Stone\'s 15-minute set came only after his sister, Vet, and the rest of the band performed for 35 minutes. As he exited the stage he told the audience near the front of the stage that he would return. He did return, but only to tell the crowd that the police were shutting down the show. While many blamed Stone for this incident, others believed that the promoter was at fault.

The same scenes were repeated at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] on July 13, 2007 with over half the sold-out venue walking out in disgust even earlier than his stage exit. The same happened again one day later at the Blue Note Records Festival in Ghent, Belgium. Here he left the stage after saying to the audience that "when waking up this morning he realized he was old, and so he needed to take a break now". He did the same again one day later, performing at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]].

[[File:Sly and the Family Stone.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Stone in Bournemouth England, July 29, 2007]]
As the tour progressed, however, Stone seemed to be more confident and animated, often dancing and engaging the audience. He performed "Stand", "[[I Want To Take You Higher]]", "Sing A Simple Song", "If You Want Me To Stay", and "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)", (which at one point morphed into "Thank you For Talkin\' To Me Africa", a track rarely performed in public). But the show was marred by sound problems and the vocals were barely audible through much of the show.
On October 17, 2008, Sly played with the Family Stone at the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in Santa Rosa, CA. He played a 22-minute set and ventured offstage, telling the crowd "I gotta go take a piss. I\'ll be right back." He never returned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bohemian.com/bohemian/10.22.08/music-slystone-0843.html |title=Music & Nightlife &#124; Sly Stone |publisher=Bohemian.com |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>
On [[Memorial Day]], May 25, 2009, Stone re-emerged once again, granting an hour-long interview with [[KCRW-FM]], a Los Angeles [[NPR]] affiliate, to discuss his life and career.

On August 18, 2009, \'\'[[The Guardian]]\'\' reported that a forthcoming documentary, \'\'Coming Back for More\'\' by Dutch director Willem Alkema, claims Stone is homeless and living off welfare whilst staying in cheap hotels and a campervan. The film alleges that Stone\'s former manager, Jerry Goldstein, cut off his access to royalty payments following a dispute over a \'debt agreement\', forcing Stone to depend on welfare payments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/18/sly-stone-living-on-welfare | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Sly Stone living on welfare, claims documentary | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=August 18, 2009}}</ref> On September 25, 2011, Alkema wrote in the \'\'[[New York Post]]\'\' that Stone was homeless and living in a van in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/the_rise_and_fall_of_sly_stone_qijyKoYzmAqer1PA0YogSJ |title=Funk legend Sly Stone now homeless and living out of a van in LA |last1=Alkema |first1=Willem |last2=Tucker |first2=Reed |date=September 25, 2011 |work=[[New York Post]] |accessdate=September 25, 2011}}</ref> although a subsequent report by [[Roger Friedman]] of \'\'[[Showbiz411]]\'\' stated that Stone is not homeless, and lives in the van by choice.<ref>{{cite news | first = Roger | last = Friedman | authorlink = Roger Friedman | title = Exclusive: Sly Stone is NOT Homeless, Article Was Paid For | date = September 27, 2011 | url = http://www.showbiz411.com/2011/09/27/exclusive-sly-stone-is-not-homeless-article-was-paid-for |work=[[Showbiz411]] |accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

On Labor Day, September 7, 2009, Stone emerged at the 20th annual African Festival of the Arts in Chicago, Ill. He performed a 15-minute set during [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]\'s Performance. He performed his popular hits along with George Clinton\'s band. He left immediately after his short performance.

On December 6, 2009, Sly signed a new recording contract with the LA based [[Cleopatra Records]] and on August 16, 2011, \'\'[[I\'m Back! Family & Friends]]\'\' was released, the first Sly Stone album since 1982\'s \'\'[[Ain\'t But the One Way]]\'\'. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly & the Family Stone\'s greatest hits with guest appearances from [[Jeff Beck]], [[Ray Manzarek]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Ann Wilson]], [[Carmine Appice]] and [[Johnny Winter]], as well as three previously unreleased songs.<!-- NOTE: Before you add anything about Sly Stone being homeless and living in a van in Crenshaw, please read the second preceding paragraph.

Sly has appeared at the club in recent years with George Clinton and performed with his daughter Novena\'s band, Baby Stone.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Sly Stone steps up for daughter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/05/25/sly.stone.returns/index.html?eref=rss_showbiz |author=Alan Duke |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref>

== Career ==

Stubblefield grew up in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], Tennessee. As a youngster his sense of rhythm was influenced by the industrial sounds of factories and trains around him.<ref name="cs-nytimes-2011" /><ref name="cs-npr-2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2015/01/05/374818384/the-original-funky-drummers-on-life-with-james-brown|title=The Original Funky Drummers On Life With James Brown|publisher=NPR Music|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150131031722/http://www.npr.org/2015/01/05/374818384/the-original-funky-drummers-on-life-with-james-brown|archivedate=January 31, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref> He was inspired to pursue drumming after seeing drummers for the first time in a parade.

Starks\' style was influenced by the church music he grew up with in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama. The two drummers had no formal training.<ref name="cs-npr-2015" /> According to Stubblefield, "We just played what we wanted to play (...) We just put down what we think it should be."<ref name="cs-nytimes-2011" /> The two "created the groves on many of Brown\'s biggest hits and laid the foundation for modern funk drumming in the process."<ref name="cs-npr-2015" />

Stubblefield has lived in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] since the 1970s. For over twenty years he played Monday nights with his band, The Clyde Stubblefield Band, in downtown Madison.

\'\'\'Sun\'\'\' is an [[R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], [[disco]], and funk band that was formed in the mid-1970s and recorded prolifically for [[Capitol Records]] from 1976 to 1984. The band was founded by Byron Byrd in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in 1976. Additional members included Kym Yancey, Chris Jones, John Wagner, Hollis Melson, and Shawn Sandridge.<ref name=Galloway>{{cite web|last=Galloway|first=Scott|title=SUN, THE GREATEST HITS CD|url=http://www.sun-thelegendaryfunkband.com}}</ref>

After being signed to Capitol by Larkin Arnold, Sun was faced with an immediate problem: an incomplete band. The black hole was in the rhythm section, so Byron Byrd recruited [[Roger Troutman]] and Lester Troutman (now with [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]]) and paid them to do some studio sessions so he could get the album finished. Lester laid drum tracks with Roger on bass, then Roger overdubbed guitar for four songs on the album, including  "Live On, Dream On." But it was on "Wanna Make Love (Come Flick My BIC)".<ref name="Wanna Make Love">{{cite web|title=Wanna Make Love (Come Flick My Bic)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Sun-Wanna-Make-Love/master/88448|author=Byron Byrd|location=http://www.discogs.com/Sun-Wanna-Make-Love/master/88448|year=1976}}</ref> Roger Troutman died April 25, 1999.

As the first single from the debut LP, \'\'Live On, Dream On\'\' (1976),<ref name="Live On, Dream On">{{cite web|title=Live On, Dream On|url=http://avaxhome.ws/music/rnb/funk/Funkadelic_165.html|location=http://avaxhome.ws/music/rnb/funk/Funkadelic_165.html|year=1976}}</ref> "[[Wanna Make Love]]" became Sun\'s first hit, peaking at #31 on \'\'Billboard\'\'\xe2\x80\x99s R&B chart.

With the release of their second album, \'\'Sun Power\'\' (pressed on orange vinyl in 1977), Sun sprang into a ten-piece configuration of multi-instrumentalists and vocalists that consisted of Byron Byrd, John Hampton Wagner, Christopher D. Jones, Hollis Melson, Dean Hummons, Kym Yancey, Shawn Sandridge, Bruce Hastell, Gary King and Ernie Knisley. The album also contained \xe2\x80\x9cConscience,\xe2\x80\x9d the song "Time Is Passing\xe2\x80\x9d (used and sampled many Rap Artists including Dr. Dre)<ref name="Dr Dre">{{cite web|title=The Car Bomb|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/2001-mw0000040094|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> plus the instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re So Hot,\xe2\x80\x9d which has been used in sports telecasts.

Sun had people from NASA do the cover animation for their fifth album, \'\'Sun Over The Universe\'\' (1980)<ref name="Sun Over The Universe">{{cite web|first=SUN LP|title=Sun Over The Universe|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/force-of-nature-mw0000855551|publisher=Capitol Records|location=http://www.allmusic.com/album/force-of-nature-mw0000855551|year=1980}}</ref>

\'\'\'The Three Degrees\'\'\' is an American female vocal group, formed in 1963 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |first= |last= |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5647|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Ed Hogan |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref> Although a total of 15 women have been a member over the years, the group has always been a trio. The current line-up consists of Valerie Holiday, Helen Scott and Freddie Pool. Holiday has been a member since she first joined in 1967, while Scott has been a permanent member since 1976, having previously been in the group from 1963-1966. The group has been most successful in the UK, were they achieved 15 top 60 hit singles between 1974 and 1998.

The original members were [[Fayette Pinkney]], Shirley Porter and Linda Turner. Porter and Turner were soon replaced by Janet Harmon and Helen Scott. From 1967-1976, the line-up was Pinkney, Valerie Holiday and [[Sheila Ferguson]], who would go on to sing lead on most of the groups biggest hits. This line-up was responsible for recording the first three (of seven) UK top 20 hits, including the 1974 single "[[When Will I See You Again]]", which was a huge international hit, peaking at #2 in the US and topping the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> When Pinkney left the group in 1976, she was replaced by a returning Helen Scott. This line-up had four more UK top twenty hits, including "Woman in Love", which reached #3 in 1979. Ferguson left for a solo career in 1986.

The groups most stable line-up was from 1989-2010, with Cynthia Garrison joining Holiday and Scott. This trio gave the group their final UK chart entry, reaching #54 in 1998 with a dance cover of "[[Last Christmas]]". Garrison was forced to leave the band at the end of 2010 for health reasons and was replaced by Freddie Pool in 2011.


==Career==

===1960s===
The Three Degrees were formed around 1963 in Philadelphia. They were discovered by [[record producer|producer]] and [[songwriter]] [[Richard Barrett (musician)|Richard Barrett]],<ref name="AMG"/> who produced the original line-up on their first [[song]], entitled "Gee Baby (I\'m Sorry)", for [[Swan Records]], in 1965.<ref name="AMG"/> Turner and Porter both left the group, leaving [[Fayette Pinkney]] the only original member. They were replaced by [[Helen Scott (Performer)|Helen Scott]] and a variety of others before Janet Harmon joined in the mid-1960s.<ref name="AMG"/> Barrett also became manager of [[Sheila Ferguson]], who had been friends with Scott since high school.<ref name="AMG"/> Barrett signed Ferguson to Swan Records in 1965.<ref name="AMG"/> The Three Degrees released a number of [[single (music)|singles]], including "I\'m Gonna Need You" and a [[cover version]] of "Maybe" in 1966.
 
When Scott left the group in 1966 to start a family,<ref name="AMG"/> Ferguson filled in for her. She remained for 20 years and was lead singer on most of the group\'s best-selling tracks. The group reciprocated with backup vocals on her solo recordings.<ref name="AMG"/> Harmon left by 1967 and was eventually replaced by Valerie Holiday.<ref name="AMG"/> Barrett signed them to [[recording contract]]s over the next three years with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], [[Metromedia]], and [[Neptune Records|Neptune]] [[record labels]],<ref name="AMG"/> the latter owned by [[Gamble and Huff|Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff]], who would work with the group five years later. The group\'s close [[harmony]] [[singing]] made them a popular [[nightclub]] act, but a hit record still eluded them.

===1970s===
By 1970, they were signed to [[Roulette Records]] and they released their first album, \'\'Maybe\'\'.<ref name="AMG"/> The title song, this time with Valerie Holiday taking the lead, took them to #4 on the [[United States|US]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|charts]]. The singles, "I Do Take You" and "You\'re The Fool" followed, as did their second album, \'\'So Much Love\'\'. This success landed them a cameo appearance in the 1971 film, \'\'[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]\'\', filmed during one of their appearances at the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana nightclub]] in [[New York City|New York]], and also an engagement at the Riviera Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] with [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1973, when their contract with Roulette ended, Barrett signed them to [[Philadelphia International Records]] under Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, where they had their greatest successes.<ref name="AMG"/> The first song they recorded for the label was with the [[recording studio|studio]] band [[MFSB]], entitled "[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]" which was the [[theme music|theme song]] for \'\'[[Soul Train]].\'\'<ref name="AMG"/> In October 1973, the group also made an appearance on the [[United States|American]] television sitcom \'\'[[Sanford and Son]]\'\' (season 3, episode 4), singing their song "I Didn\'t Know".<ref name="AMG"/>

Their first album for the Philadelphia International label, simply titled \'\'[[The Three Degrees (album)|The Three Degrees]]\'\', spawned three hits: "Dirty Ol\' Man" (which went [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]), "Year Of Decision" (which made it to #13 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]),<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

It topped the UK Chart for two weeks in August 1974 (the first time this had been achieved by an all-female group since [[The Supremes]] in 1964,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>) and became the fourth best-selling single of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.co.uk/chart3.html |title=1970s Singles Chart Archive |publisher=everyHit.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> It also reached #2 in the US, where it sold over two million copies and earned the trio a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] in December 1974<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The Three Degrees also recorded two [[live album]]s: one in [[Leicester]] in the UK, and the other in [[Tokyo]] in [[Japan]], and released both in 1975. The trio\'s second studio album for the Philadelphia label, \'\'[[The Three Degrees International]]\'\', was marketed internationally under different titles and in various languages. In [[Continental Europe]], it was called \'\'With Love\'\', and it spawned the hit single "Take Good Care Of Yourself", which reached the UK Top 10. The UK release of the album was actually titled \'\'Take Good Care Of Yourself\'\' and peaked at #6 in the UK Album Chart, their highest ever chart placing for an album there.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Two other songs from the album were big successes in Japan: "Midnight Train" and "Nigai Namida", the latter having been recorded in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

In 1976, the Three Degrees parted company with Gamble and Huff and moved to CBS Sony/Epic Records where they released the [[concept album]], \'\'A Toast Of Love\'\', purely for the [[Far East]] market, although a single of the title track was released internationally. In 1976, Pinkney decided to leave the group and return to full-time education and was replaced by former band member Helen Scott.<ref name="AMG" /> In 1977, they released the album, \'\'Standing Up For Love\'\',<ref name="AMG" /> although this would be their last release for CBS/Epic.

In 1978, The Three Degrees signed to [[Ariola Records]] in Europe and the US and began working with [[Giorgio Moroder]], who had become famous as a disco producer following his work with [[Donna Summer]]. Further success was to follow, and they released two disco-styled albums on Ariola (\'\'[[New Dimensions]]\'\' in 1978, and \'\'[[3D (The Three Degrees album)|3D]]\'\' in 1979) which delivered four UK Top 20 hits between them: "Givin\' Up Givin\' In", "Woman In Love"(originally recorded by [[Twiggy]] in 1977), "The Runner" and "My Simple Heart". The group performed for [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] at his 30th birthday party in 1978, and were guests at the pre-wedding party for his marriage to [[Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981.<ref name="AMG"/> Their own [[television special]], \'\'[[The Three Degrees at The Royal Albert Hall]]\'\' (aka \'\'An Evening with The Three Degrees\'\'), was recorded in October 1979 in which the trio were backed by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]].

===1980s===
In 1980, the compilation album \'\'Gold\'\' was released and became a UK Top 10 hit. Featuring one side of their hits on the Ariola label between 1978\xe2\x80\x9379, and one side of live recordings from their 1979 Royal Albert Hall television special, this would be the trio\'s second "best of" compilation to make the UK Top 10 in less than two years, after CBS released \'\'A Collection of their 20 Greatest Hits\'\' in early 1979 (which featured their pre-Ariola material, and peaked at #8 in the UK Album Chart).

Between 1982 and 1985, The Three Degrees released two albums on their own 3D label; \'\'Album of Love\'\' and \'\'Live in the UK\'\'.<ref name="AMG"/> On that label they also released a single written by Sheila Ferguson, entitled "Liar".<ref name="AMG"/> A third [[BBC Television]] show was also recorded in 1982, titled \'\'Take 3 Degrees\'\', which included performances of their greatest hits, and also songs that the group were performing in their latest show, such as "I Can\'t Turn You Loose" and "Celebration". They returned to the UK [[record chart|charts]] in 1985 with "The Heaven I Need" which was produced by [[Stock/Aitken/Waterman]] on Supreme Records, though the single narrowly missed the UK Top 40.<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1986, [[Miquel Brown]] filled in for Scott while the latter was pregnant. That same year Ferguson decided to leave the group.<ref name="AMG"/> Scott and Holiday replaced her with Vera Brown of [[The Ritchie Family]] in 1986, and then Rhea Harris in 1987. In 1989, Scott and Holiday, along with new recruit Victoria Wallace, recorded an album entitled \'\'Three Degrees...And Holding\'\' on [[Ichiban Records]].<ref name="AMG"/> A single, "A Tender Lie" was also released. Following the album, the group recorded a live [[Compact disc|CD]] at [[London]]\'s [[Dominion Theatre]], with [[Billy Paul]] and [[Harold Melvin & the Bluenotes]] in 1989.<ref name="AMG"/> The group followed this with another tour of the UK and Japan at the end of the year.

===1990s onwards===
In December 1989, Cynthia Garrison replaced Wallace forming the longest running line-up of the group.  In 1993, they were asked to record a new version of "When Will I See You Again" with [[Thomas Anders]] (of [[Modern Talking]]). He supplied three tracks for their album \'\'[[Out of the Past Into the Future]]\'\', marking their return to Ariola Records and their most successful album for 15 years, Two further singles were released from the album, the re-recording of "Dirty Ol\' Man" and new song "Hurry Hurry". In 1996 they released a new best of album titled \'\'Best & New Hits: When Will I See You Again\'\', which included four re-recorded hits and six new songs.<ref name="Three Degrees : discography">{{cite web|url=http://3degrees.eg2.fr/page_discographique_originale_uk.htm |title=Three Degrees : discography |publisher=3degrees.eg2.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> A seasonal album, \'\'Christmas With The Three Degrees\'\', was also recorded in 1998. This album included a cover of [[Wham]]\'s "[[Last Christmas]]",which was released as a remixed dance single which gave the group their 15th (and final) UK top 60 single, reaching #54.

Scott, Holiday and Garrison continued to tour. They made their first US TV appearance in over 20 years in 2003 on the [[PBS]] show, \'\'Rhythm, Love, and Soul\'\' with [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Lou Rawls]] and [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]]. They were also part of the \'Best Disco In Town 2004 Tour\' with [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[The Emotions]], and [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn "Champagne" King]].  They also took part in the 2007 \'Best Disco In Town\' tour of the United Kingdom in May 2007.

In 2008 the group released the album \'\'Helen, Valerie, Cynthia: The Greatest Hits\'\', which included completely new recordings of the group\'s biggest hits and some fan favourites.<ref name="apple1">{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/cynthia-garrison-helen-scott/id291008814 |title=iTunes - Music : Greatest Hits Of The Three Degrees by Cynthia Garrison, Helen Scott & Valerie Holiday |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref>

The group, together with founder member Fayette Pinkney, received various honours during 2007 and 2008, through BEMA (The Black Entertainment and Music Association) and the City of Philadelphia for their contribution to music over five decades, creating, for the first time, The Four Degrees.

Fayette Pinkney died on June 27, 2009, in Lansdale Hospital, Pennsylvania, after a short illness, at the age of 61.<ref>{{cite web|author=Doc Rock |url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2009.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 2009 January to June |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref>

In 2009 the group released their first studio album in over ten years, \'\'Undercover 2009\'\'. It contained a selection of eight cover versions of classic songs by [[Abba]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Paul Simon]] and [[Bee Gees]].<ref name="apple2">{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-three-degrees-undercover/id332698203 |title=iTunes - Music - The Three Degrees - Undercover 2009 by The Three Degrees |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The following year they released a new single "Holding Back".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/holding-back/id388634316 |title=Connecting to the iTunes Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref>

In January 2011, Freddie Pool replaced Cynthia Garrison, who was suffering from [[Piriformis syndrome]], as the Degrees had touring commitments to fulfill.

The Holiday/Scott/Garrison version of The Three Degrees was the longest running formation of the group (1989\xe2\x80\x932010).

\'\'\'Tower of Power\'\'\' (or \'\'\'TOP\'\'\' for short) is an [[United States|American]] [[R&B]]-based [[horn section]] and band, originating in [[Oakland, California]], that has been performing since 1968.<ref name="official website1">{{cite web|url=http://www.towerofpower.com/|title=Tower of Power Home|author=Official Website|date=1968\xe2\x80\x932009 |publisher= Tower of Power|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> They are best known for their funky soul sound highlighted by a powerful horn section and precisely syncopated bass-guitar lines. There have been several lead vocalists, the most famous being [[Lenny Williams]], who fronted the band between early 1973 and late 1974, the period of their greatest commercial success. Their biggest hits include "You\'re Still a Young Man", "So Very Hard to Go","Soul With a Capital S", "Soul Vaccination", "What Is Hip?", and "Don\'t Change Horses (in the Middle of a Stream)".

==History==
In the summer of 1968, tenor saxophonist/vocalist [[Emilio Castillo]] met [[Stephen Kupka|Stephen "Doc" Kupka]], who played baritone sax. Castillo had played in several bands, but Castillo\'s father told his son to "hire that guy" after a home audition. Together, they became the backbone of Tower of Power. Within months the group, then known as The Motowns, began playing various gigs around [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], their soul sound relating to both minority and rebellious listeners.<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/><!-- self reference <ref name="band profile">{{cite web|title="Band profile"|url=http://www.towerofpower.com/the-band/}}</ref>-->

Castillo really wanted to play Bill Graham\'s Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, but he realized he would never get in with a name like The Motowns. So, on a break from recording in a little studio in Hayward, Castillo was sitting on the studio owner\'s desk, and right in front of him was a long list of weird band names. He looked through it and saw Tower Of Power and thought "Yeah, that describes us." The band agreed so the name stuck.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lacy-Thompson|first1=Tony|title=Tower Of Power Still Bringing It|url=http://regardingarts.com/music/tower2014.html|website=www.RegardingArts.com|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

By 1970, the now renamed Tower of Power (including [[trumpet]]/arranger [[Greg Adams (musician)|Greg Adams]], first trumpet [[Mic Gillette]], first saxophone Skip Mesquite, [[Rocco Prestia|Francis "Rocco" Prestia]] on bass, Willie Fulton on guitar, and drummer [[David Garibaldi (musician)|David Garibaldi]]) signed a recording contract with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]\'s \'\'San Francisco Records\'\' and released their first album, \'\'[[East Bay Grease]]\'\'. Rufus Miller performed most of the lead vocals on this debut album.<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/> The group was first introduced to the San Francisco Bay area by radio station KSAN, which played a variety of artists such as [[Cold Blood (band)|Cold Blood]], [[Eric Mercury]] and [[Marvin Gaye]]\'s album "What\'s Goin On" in its entirety before the bay area\'s soul and R&B stations became aware. Dusty Street of the Flying Eye Radio Network\'s Fly Low show and Sirius XM radio was a DJ there in the late 1960s/early 1970s. The single "Sparkling in the Sand" received airplay on famed Bay Area soul station [[KDIA]].

Augmented by percussionist/conga/bongo player Brent Byars, Tower of Power was released from their San Francisco label contract and moved to Warner Brothers Records. With Rick Stevens now singing lead, 1972\'s \'\'[[Bump City]]\'\' gave the band their first national exposure. This album included the hit single "You\'re Still a Young Man", which peaked at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Stevens\' pinnacle vocal performance before leaving the band.<ref name="Billboard Songs Hot 100"/> Emilio Castillo, who, along with Stephen Kupka, co-wrote "You\'re Still a Young Man," told Songfacts that the song was based on a true story concerning a former girlfriend who was six years older.<ref name="songfacts">{{cite web | url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3837 | title = You\'re Still a Young Man | work = Songfacts.com | accessdate = 2009-05-27}}</ref> Though not a big hit single "Down to the Nightclub" received heavy airplay on West Coast FM stations and several AM stations. Both songs still get substantial airplay on [[oldies]] radio and remain fan favorites.

\'\'Tower of Power\'\', released in the spring of 1973, was the third album for the band. It featured Lenny Williams on lead vocals and Lenny Pickett on lead tenor saxophone. Bruce Conte replaced guitarist Willy Fulton and keyboardist Chester Thompson also joined the band during the recording of the album. This was the group\'s most successful album. It peaked at #15 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Pop Albums]] chart and was [[RIAA]] certified as a gold record (for sales in excess of 500,000 copies). The album also spawned their most-successful single "So Very Hard To Go". Although the single peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100,<ref name="Billboard Songs Hot 100"/> it landed in the Top 10 on the surveys of many West Coast Top 40 radio stations, hitting #1 on many of them. The album also charted two other singles on the Billboard Hot 100, "This Time It\'s Real" and "What Is Hip?" The latter is possibly their most enduring song.

1974\'s \'\'[[Back to Oakland]]\'\' spawned another hit, "Don\'t Change Horses (in the Middle of a Stream)", that reached #26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and "Time Will Tell", which charted at #69.<ref name="Billboard Songs Hot 100"/>

On some of their releases in the mid-1970s, such as \'\'Urban Renewal\'\' (1974), the band moved more toward [[funk]] than soul; however, they continued recording ballads as well. Williams left the band in late 1974, and was replaced as vocalist by [[Hubert Tubbs]]. Though the band remained popular, their days of chart radio airplay declined. During the late 1970s they briefly tried recording disco-sounding material.<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/> Leader Emilio Castillo said in an interview that the band\'s brief foray into quasi-[[disco]] was at the request of [[Columbia Records]], who had the band under contract at the time.

Tower of Power still tours extensively today, although there have been many changes in personnel over the years. At least 60 musicians have toured or recorded with the band over their 40-plus-year existence. These include current \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' musical director/saxophonist Lenny Pickett, drummer David Garibaldi, bassist Francis "Rocco" Prestia, organ master Chester Thompson, saxophonists [[Richard Elliot]] and [[Euge Groove]], and guitarist [[Bruce Conte]]. Conte\'s cousin, [[BALCO]] founder [[Victor Conte]], also played bass guitar in the band from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. Former lead vocalist Rick Stevens (real name Donald Stevenson) was sentenced to life in prison on three counts of [[first-degree murder]] for crimes committed after leaving the band. Stevens was paroled on July 20, 2012 after 36 years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thisblksistaspage.wordpress.com/2012/08/12/rick-stevens-early-tower-of-power-lead-singer-has-been-released-on-parole/ |title=Rick Stevens, Early Tower of Power Lead Singer, Has Been Released on Parole &#124; This Black Sista\'s Page |publisher=Thisblksistaspage.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>  Bruce Conte rejoined the band in 2006, replacing veteran guitarist Jeff Tamelier. He departed after slightly more than a year, citing personal recording projects and health issues. Following Conte as guitarist was Charles Spikes (while auditions for a permanent player were held), then Mark Harper. The band\'s current guitarist is Jerry Cortez.

==Collaborations with other bands==
Tower of Power appears in the lead single off the band [[Heart (band)|Heart]]\'s fifth album, "[[Bebe le Strange]]", released in 1980. The lead single off that album, "[[Even It Up]]", was a commercial success for the band and peaked at number 33 on the Billboard. They played the backing horn sections in the song. Tower of Power has made guest appearances on other major recording solo artists\' albums. They guested with [[Little Feat]]. In 1993 the band was featured on [[Luis Miguel]]\'s \'\'[[Aries (album)|Aries]]\'\', in a cover of "Attitude Dance" titled "Que Nivel de Mujer". More recently, Tower of Power has been featured on [[Josh Groban]]\'s \'\'[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]\'\', during an instrumental break in "Machine".
Roger Smith is featured on [[Dave Matthews Band]]\'s song "If Only" from their album [[Away from the World]].

==Horn section collaborations==
The Tower of Power horn section has gained renown as a separate entity to much critical acclaim. They have appeared on a number of other artists\' recordings, including one of the most highly regarded early live albums: a performance with [[Little Feat]] in 1977, one of the three [[inaugural]] acts to perform at the newly opened [[Rockpalast]] studios on the song, "Rocket in my Pocket".

Other performers supported by the Tower of Power horns include innovative electric slap bass guitarist [[Larry Graham]]\'s [[Graham Central Station]], [[The Monkees]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Carlos Santana|Santana]], [[Elkie Brooks]], [[Cat Stevens]] (on his \'\'[[Foreigner Suite]]\'\'), [[Luis Miguel]], [[Elton John]], [[Linda Lewis]], [[rad. (artist)|rad.]] (Rose Ann Dimalanta), [[Jermaine Jackson]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Mickey Hart]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[Frankie Valli]], [[Spyro Gyra]], [[KMFDM]],<ref name="KMFDM">{{cite news | url=http://www.beermelodies.com/interviews/kmfdm-ready-to-%E2%80%98xtort%E2%80%99-2/ | title=KMFDM Ready to \'Xtort\' | author=Fortunato, John | work=[[The Aquarian Weekly]] | publisher=Arts Weekly, Inc. | year=1996 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Phish]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Pharoahe Monch]], [[Brothers Johnson]], [[Sam The Band]], and [[Aerosmith]], among many other acts.<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/> Their early song "So Very Hard To Go" was featured in the soundtrack of the 2002 film \'\'[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]\'\', as well as Will Ferrell\'s \'\'[[Semi-Pro]]\'\'.

==Recent work==
Tower of Power has been recording and touring continuously since 1968, and the band maintains a very busy tour calendar. In 2008 they celebrated their 40th anniversary with shows in San Mateo, California, in August, and at the Fillmore in San Francisco on October 18, 2008. At the Fillmore many former band members made onstage appearances. The entire event was recorded and released on DVD and Blu-ray.

Tower of Power has released 19 albums over the years (compilations and regional variations not included),<ref name="AllMusic Credits"/> the latest being 2009\'s homage to classic soul songs \'\'The Great American Soulbook\'\'.

Tower of Power\'s horn section has become the good-luck charm for most championship-bound San Francisco Bay area sports teams, having played \'\'[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\'\' at championship playoff games at [[AT&T Park]], [[Candlestick Park]], [[HP Pavilion at San Jose]], [[O.co Coliseum]] and [[Oracle Arena]], among other venues.

==Band members==

===Emilio Castillo===
\'\'\'Emilio "Mimi" Castillo\'\'\' (born September 24, 1950, [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]) is a [[saxophone]] player and [[composer]] and is best known as the founder of the band. After he was caught stealing by his father, who told him he could stay in his room until he thought of something to keep himself off the street, Castillo chose music. He took lessons in saxophone, [[piano]], [[guitar]], and also in music theory from one-time [[Dave Brubeck]] bass player [[Norman Bates (musician)|Norman Bates]]. His first musical endeavor was as a keyboard player in a [[British Invasion]] style group, The Gotham City Crimefighters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpcity.com/memorabilia/gotham.htm |title=Tower of Power - Home |publisher=Bumpcity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> After seeing the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] soul band The Spyders, Castillo switched to saxophone and formed The Motowns, which played [[soul music]] covers.

After meeting baritone sax player Stephen Kupka, Castillo switched, on Kupka\'s suggestion, to performing original material and the band changed its name to Tower of Power. Castillo has been with the band ever since, as leader and 2nd tenor saxophonist. He and Kupka are also responsible for writing many of the band\'s best-known songs.

===Stephen Kupka===
\'\'\'Stephen Mackenzie "Doc" Kupka\'\'\' (a.k.a. "The Funky Doctor") (born 25 March 1946, in Berkeley, California) is a [[baritone saxophone]] player and composer, and is a founding member of the band.

In 1968, Kupka met Emilio Castillo and joined his soul music cover band, The Motowns, which was based in Oakland, California. Kupka convinced Castillo to start performing original songs, and they changed the band\'s name to Tower of Power. Kupka has been with Tower of Power ever since, and is also responsible for co-writing (with Castillo) a majority of the band\'s songs.

"Doc" plays a Yamaha YBS-62 baritone saxophone, Berg Larsen 130 facing metal mouthpiece, and Rico Plasticover 1.5 strength reeds. Kupka has also recorded with numerous other artists, including [[The B-52\'s]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Elton John]], [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[Little Feat]], [[Elkie Brooks]], and [[Bonnie Raitt]].

He was a member of the Tower of Power Horns from 1972 until 1981, and since 1985 has been the tenor saxophone soloist with the \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\' band. He has served as the \'\'Saturday Night Live\'\' band\'s musical director since 1995. He is known particularly for his skill in the [[altissimo]] register (executed by using a combination of [[embouchure]] control, air stream control, and alternate fingerings), which can be heard during the opening credits of each episode of \'\'Saturday Night Live\'\'.

Pickett grew up in Berkeley, California.<!--When did he move from New Mexico to Berkeley?--> He has no formal musical training, did not attend high school beyond the ninth grade and did not attend college. Except for a brief period of study with the jazz saxophonist Bert Wilson (another player known for his facility with the altissimo register)<!--Did Pickett study altissimo technique from Wilson?--> after dropping out of high school in Berkeley, he is completely self-taught in the saxophone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peak.org/~louierec/HalleyJazzForum.html |title=Rich Halley - Jazz Forum review |publisher=Peak.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref> While with the Tower of Power Horns, which he joined when he was 18 years old, he performed with [[Elton John]] and many other rhythm and blues and soul groups. He has also worked as a saxophonist and an arranger for artists including [[David Bowie]], [[Talking Heads]], and [[Laurie Anderson]]. As a composer, he has written for his group, the Borneo Horns, and has received a number of commissions to write works mixing classical and popular idioms for a variety of musical ensembles, including the New Century Saxophone Quartet, as well as music for theater and collaborations with dancers, poets and filmmakers.

He is a professor of jazz saxophone at [[New York University]].

===Bruce Conte===
{{Main|Bruce Conte}}
\'\'\'Bruce Conte\'\'\' was born in Sanger, and grew up in Fresno, California. Prior to joining the band, Conte was a guitarist in various Bay Area groups, including [[The Loading Zone]], who shared rehearsal halls with, and regularly opened shows for Tower Of Power. Conte joined Tower of Power in 1972, at the beginning of the recording sessions for the band\'s third album, and remained with them until 1979. He briefly returned for live work from 2006-2007. In addition to playing guitar, Conte also contributed backing vocals and wrote a number of songs for the band. Bruce was also the guitarist on TOP\'s latest release, \'\'The Great American Soulbook\'\'.

===Jerry Cortez===
\'\'\'Jerry Cortez\'\'\' joined Tower of Power in January 2010 as guitarist. Being raised in the San Francisco Bay Area allowed Jerry to experience firsthand some of the greatest music from the best bands of the sixties and seventies. Raised in a family of musicians, his father a jazz saxophonist and his brother a drummer, led to musical opportunities at an early age playing clubs seven nights a week before he was old enough to be admitted. His early influences include the Beatles, Clapton, Hendrix, Peter Greene and James Brown. Jerry\'s father brought home Tower of Power\'s first album and ToP became a family favorite.

Jerry rounds out one of the most unique rhythm sections in the music world. Filling the shoes of former guitar players like Willie Fulton and Bruce Conte, who created many of the signature licks the band is known for, proves challenging as he brings his own flavor to the songs while still honoring the past.

===Ray Greene===
\'\'\'Ray Greene\'\'\' is the current TOP\'s lead vocalist.  Ray Greene replaced Larry Braggs as TOP\'s lead vocalist on December 31, 2013. Ray grew up in Georgia listening to his father sing Gospel music. He was exposed to the recordings of Sam Cooke, James Brown and Otis Redding at a young age. This music would leave an indelible mark on Ray throughout his life and career as a musician. When Ray came to Boston to attend Berklee College of Music as a trombonist, one of his first exposures to performing in horn bands was getting to play a significant portion of the Tower of Power playbook.
"Needless to say, when I received the call from Mr. Castillo to join the group, I was excited, thankful and completely filled with joy. I have a profound respect and admiration for all of the great vocalists that have preceded me, especially Mr. Larry Braggs, who is the longest tenured singer ever to grace the Tower of Power stage.
I look forward to carrying on the legacy and becoming a part of the ToP family. I cannot wait to share the gift I have been given with each and every one of you!"

Politzer contributes to the band\'s complex sound with his first tenor sax, alto sax, flute, and clarinet. Tom, who started playing clarinet at an early age, has an extensive classical music background, joining school bands and local youth orchestras. While in Junior High, the Jazz Band needed someone to fill the baritone sax chair. He switched from playing clarinet to baritone sax (inspired, in part, by Tower of Power\xe2\x80\x99s song, \xe2\x80\x9cSquib Cakes\xe2\x80\x9d).

===Brent Carter===
\'\'\'Brent Carter\'\'\' A native New Yorker, Carter attended the Performing Arts High School of New York, where he studied acting and voice. Early on he landed the role of Gabriel in Broadway\'s Shenandoah. He later attended the State University of New York at New Paltz.

\'\'\'Roger Troutman\'\'\' (November 29, 1951 &ndash; April 25, 1999) was an American composer, songwriter, producer and the founder of the band [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] who helped spearhead the [[funk]] movement and heavily influenced [[west coast hip hop]] due to the scene\'s heavy sampling of his music over the years. Troutman was well known for his use of the vocoder or the [[talk box]], a device that is connected to an instrument (frequently a keyboard) to create different vocal effects. Roger used a custom-made talkbox\xe2\x80\x94the Electro Harmonix "Golden Throat," as well as a [[Yamaha]] DX100 FM synthesizer.  As both band leader of Zapp and in his subsequent solo releases, he scored a bevy of funk and R&B hits throughout the 1980s.
==Biography==

===Early career: Parliament-Funkadelic and Zapp===
{{undue|section|date=November 2014}}
Born in [[Hamilton, Ohio]], Roger was the fourth of ten children. He was a late-arriving member of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and played on the band\'s final Warner Brothers\' album \'\'[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]\'\'. The first band Roger was in was THE CRUSADERS. The band played in Cincinnati and recorded a 45 record Busted Surfboard and Seminole. The band members were Rick Schoeny, Roy Beck, Dave Spitzmiller, and Denny Niebold. Troutman had formed various other bands with his four brothers, including Little Roger and the Vels and Roger and the Human Body. In 1977, he and the Human Body issued their first single, "Freedom". Within two years, Roger and his brothers were discovered by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], who signed the newly christened [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] to his Uncle Jam Records label in 1979. The original line-up consisted of Roger Troutman, [[Larry Troutman]], Lester Troutman, Terry Troutman, Gregory Jackson and Bobby Glover. Zapp made their professional television debut on the first and only Funk Music Awards show. A year later, as Uncle Jam Records was forced to close, Zapp signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and released their self-titled debut, which yielded the [[Bootsy Collins]] produced & Troutman-composed hit, "[[More Bounce to the Ounce]]." The song peaked at number two on the \'\'[[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard Soul Singles]]\'\' chart in the fall of 1980. The debut album reached the top 20 of the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]] and firmly launched Zapp and Roger into the national spotlight.

Between 1980 and 1985, [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] released the gold-selling albums \'\'[[Zapp (album)|Zapp]]\'\', \'\'[[Zapp II]]\'\', \'\'[[Zapp III]]\'\' and \'\'[[The New Zapp IV U]]\'\' and released top ten R&B hit singles such as "Be Alright", "Dance Floor", "I Can Make You Dance", "Heartbreaker", "It Doesn\'t Really Matter" - which was a tribute to black artists of the past and present, and the [[Charlie Wilson (musician)|Charlie Wilson]] and [[Shirley Murdock]]-assisted funk ballad, "Computer Love". Zapp\'s hit making magic faded shortly after the release of their fifth album, \'\'[[Zapp Vibe]]\'\', in 1989. Throughout Zapp\'s tenure, the original lineup grew to around fifteen. In 1993, the group scored their biggest-selling album when a compilation album, \'\'Zapp & Roger: All the Greatest Hits\'\', was released, featuring remixed cuts of Roger\'s solo singles and featuring the new single "[[Slow and Easy]]" as well as "Mega Medley", which put together a collection of the group\'s hit singles in a remix. The album sold over two million copies giving the collective their most successful album to date. After the untimely death of Roger and Larry, the remaining brothers have stepped forward with the album, \'\'[[Zapp VI: Back By Popular Demand]]\'\' in 2002.

===Solo career and production work on other artists===
In 1981, upon the fast-paced success of Zapp\'s first album, Troutman cut his first solo album, \'\'[[The Many Facets of Roger]]\'\'. Featuring his frenetic funk cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]\'s "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]", the song exploded to number one on the R&B singles chart helping the album sell over a million copies. The album also featured the hit, "So Ruff, So Tuff", which was similar to "More Bounce..." as were most Roger/Zapp singles during this time. In 1984, Troutman issued his second solo album, \'\'The Saga Continues\'\', which featured the singles "Girl Cut It Out", "It\'s in the Mix" - which was dedicated to \'\'[[Soul Train]]\'\' and its host [[Don Cornelius]] in one verse, and a cover of [[Wilson Pickett]]\'s "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", which featured [[Gospel music|gospel]] group [[The Mighty Clouds of Joy]]. In 1987, Troutman scored his most successful solo album with \'\'Unlimited!\'\', which featured the massive hit, "[[I Want to Be Your Man]]", which rose to number one R&B and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]].

Alongside his successful careers as Zapp member and solo star, Troutman also became a hands-on producer and writer for other artists including [[Shirley Murdock]], whose 1985 platinum debut featured the Roger-produced hit, "As We Lay". He also produced for Zapp member Dale DeGroat on his solo efforts. In 1988, Troutman made an appearance on [[Scritti Politti]]\'s third album [[Provision]], providing [[talk box]] vocals on the songs "Boom There She Was" and "Sugar and Spice". Three years later, Troutman released his final solo album with \'\'Bridging the Gap\'\', featuring the hit "Everybody (Get Up)". He worked with [[Elvis Costello]] as a guest appearance on 1991\'s [[Mighty Like a Rose]] on the song "The Other Side of Summer". In 1989, [[NBA Entertainment]] selected Troutman among a variety of renowned candidates to record a tribute song called "I\'m So Happy" for [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], who at the time was in the final year of his record-breaking, 20-year career in the [[NBA]].

===Career re-emergence===
After the release of \'\'All the Greatest Hits\'\', Roger and Zapp were basically existing as a touring group only recording sporadically. Troutman was starting to be featured on hip-hop songs by this time agreeing to appear on rapper [[Snoop Dogg]]\'s 1993 debut, \'\'[[Doggystyle]]\'\'. In 1995 he was featured on Eazy-E\'s post-mortem album [[Str8 off tha Streetz of Muthaphukkin Compton]] on the last track [[Eternal E (song)|Eternal E]] along with DJ Yella. The same year Troutman agreed to enlist vocals on [[2Pac]] and [[Dr. Dre]]\'s single, "[[California Love]]". The song became Troutman\'s biggest-selling and most successful single to date as the song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistID=37157&model.vnuAlbumId=285188 |title=2Pac Billboard Chart History |accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> and sold over two million copies giving Troutman a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |title=Grammy Archive |accessdate=2004-04-12}}</ref> This success led to Troutman being included in a top ten R&B hit cover of [[The Persuaders (band)|The Persuaders]]\' "[[Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]", which he produced and enlisted the talk box alongside [[Shirley Murdock]] and R&B group [[H-Town]].  The \'\'A Thin Line Between Love and Hate\'\' movie soundtrack also included a club hit "Chocolate City". In 1998, he appeared in a remix version of [[Sounds of Blackness]]\' "Hold On (A Change Is Coming)," which sampled Zapp\'s "Doo-Wah Ditty (Blow That Thing)".  Throughout the 1990s, Roger was promoted heavily by [[Timothy Olague]] Entertainment in shows at emerging Indian Casinos in Arizona and California.

===Death===
On the morning of April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was found shot and critically wounded outside his northwest Dayton recording studio around 7 a.m. According to doctors, the 47-year-old had been shot several times in the torso and was in critical condition; he died during surgery at the local hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital and Health Center. Roger\'s brother [[Larry Troutman|Larry]]  was found dead in a car a few blocks away with a single gunshot wound to the head. A [[pistol]] was found inside the vehicle, which matched the description of a car leaving the scene of Roger Troutman\'s shooting according to witnesses.<ref name="sfw">{{cite web | title = California Loved | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2002-08-14/news/california-loved/ | accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> The gun found with Larry Troutman also matched the one that fired the fatal shots into Roger, suggesting that Larry had shot Roger and then taken his own life.<ref name="sfw" />  With both men dead, and with no known witnesses, the specific motive for the attack remains unknown. Friends and family could only speculate that the source of a dispute was a rising tension between the brothers over issues such as Larry\'s financial troubles and Roger\'s desire to dissolve their business partnership.

Troutman, who lived 24 years in the Dayton area, is survived by 6 sons: Roger Lynch (January 31, 1970 &ndash; January 22, 2003), Larry Gates, Lester Gates, Brent Lynch, Ryan Stevens and Taji J. Troutman; 5 daughters, Daun Shazier,  Hope Shazier, Summer Gates, Mia Paris Collins, Gene Nicole Anderson; and 4 grandchildren.  In remembrance, Roger\'s nephew Clet Troutman sang "Amazing Grace" through a talkbox at his funeral.

 ****** The Undisputed Truth

b'{{About||the albums|The Undisputed Truth (The Undisputed Truth album)|and|The Undisputed Truth (Brother Ali album)}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}
\'\'\'The Undisputed Truth\'\'\' was a 1970s [[Motown]] recording act, assembled by [[record producer]] [[Norman Whitfield]] as a means for being able to experiment with his [[psychedelic soul]] production techniques. \'\'\'Joe Harris\'\'\' served as main lead singer, with \'\'\'Billie Rae Calvin\'\'\' and \'\'\'Brenda Joyce Evans\'\'\', formerly of The Delicates, on additional leads and background vocals.

==History==
The group\'s music and unusual costuming (large [[Afro]]s and white makeup) typified the then-popular trend of "[[psychedelic soul]]" which producer [[Norman Whitfield]] had inaugurated. A number of their singles became minor hits, and many of them were also songs for Whitfield\'s main act, [[The Temptations]], among them "You Make Your Own Heaven and Hell Right Here on Earth" and "[[Papa Was a Rollin\' Stone|Papa Was A Rollin\' Stone]]." Their [[one-hit wonder|single Top 40 hit in the United States]] was the ominous "[[Smiling Faces Sometimes]]," originally recorded by The Temptations, which hit #3 on the US pop charts in 1971.

The Undisputed Truth, along with [[Rose Royce]] and [[Willie Hutch]], followed Whitfield during his exodus from Motown to set up [[Whitfield Records]] in 1975. At this time, Calvin and Joyce left the group, and Harris was joined by new members Virginia "V" McDonald, Tyrone "Big Ty" Douglas, Tyrone "Lil Ty" Barkley, and Calvin "Dhaak" Stephenson. The group\'s costuming and style changed as well, becoming even more unusual and [[Funkadelic]]-influenced. Former member Calvin later wrote songs for Whitfield\'s other group [[Rose Royce]], including the hit single "[[Wishing on a Star]]".

However, the group had little success at the new label, and faded into obscurity after two more albums, although they charted in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1977 (#43) with the [[disco]] single "You + Me = Love" from the album \'\'Method to the Madness.\'\'<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The lead singer on the single "You + Me = Love" was [[Taka Boom]], who is [[Chaka Khan]]\'s younger sister.

\'\'\'War\'\'\' (originally called \'\'\'Eric Burdon and War\'\'\') is an [[United States|American]] [[funk]] band from [[California]], known for the hit songs "[[Low Rider]]", "[[Spill the Wine]]", "[[Summer (War song)|Summer]]", "[[Why Can\'t We Be Friends? (song)|Why Can\'t We Be Friends?]]", "[[The Cisco Kid]]", and "[[The World Is a Ghetto]]". Formed in 1969, War was a musical crossover band which fused elements of [[rock music|rock]], funk, [[jazz]], [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[reggae]].<ref name="amWar">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5788|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography page]</ref> The band also transcended racial and cultural barriers with a multi-[[ethnic group|ethnic]] line-up. War was also subject to many line-up changes over the course of its formation, leaving member [[Lonnie Jordan|Leroy "Lonnie" Jordan]] as the only original member in the current line-up.

Although War\'s lyrics are often socio-political in nature, their music usually had a laid-back, California funk vibe. A particular feature of War\'s sound is the use of harmonica and saxophone playing melody lines in unison, sounding like a single instrument, for example in the melody of "Low Rider". The music has been sampled and recorded by many singers and groups, ranging from R&B/[[pop music|pop]] singers such as [[Janet Jackson]] to [[nu metal]] band [[Korn]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] groups like [[TLC (music)|TLC]] and [[A$AP Mob]].

==1960s: Beginnings==
In 1962, [[Howard E. Scott]] and [[Harold Ray Brown|Harold Brown]] formed a group called The Creators in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]]. Within a few years, they had added [[Charles Miller (musician)|Charles Miller]], [[B. B. Dickerson|Morris "B. B." Dickerson]] and [[Lonnie Jordan]] to the lineup. [[Lee Oskar]] and [[Papa Dee Allen]] later joined as well. They all shared a love of diverse styles of music, which they had absorbed living in the racially-mixed Los Angeles ghettos. The Creators recorded several singles on [[Dore Records]] while working with Tjay Contrelli, a saxophonist from the band [[Love (band)|Love]]. In 1968, the Creators became Nightshift (named because Brown worked nights at a steel yard) and started performing with [[Deacon Jones]], a [[American football|football]] player and singer.

The original War was conceived by record producer Jerry Goldstein ("[[My Boyfriend\'s Back (song)|My Boyfriend\'s Back]]", "[[Hang on Sloopy]]", "[[I Want Candy]]") and singer [[Eric Burdon]] (ex-lead singer of the British band [[the Animals]]). In 1969, Goldstein saw musicians who would eventually become War playing at the Rag Doll in [[North Hollywood]], backing Deacon Jones, and he was attracted to the band\'s sound. Jordan claimed that the band\'s goal was to spread a message of brotherhood and harmony, using instruments and voices to speak out against racism, hunger, gangs, crimes, and turf Lowriders, and promote hope and the spirit of brotherhood.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Eric Burdon and War began playing live shows to audiences throughout Southern California before entering into the studio to record their debut album \'\'[[Eric Burdon Declares "War"]]\'\'. The album\'s best known track, "[[Spill the Wine]]", was a hit and launched the band\'s career.

==1970s: Height of popularity==
Eric Burdon and War toured extensively across [[Europe]] and [[United States|the United States]]. A reviewer from \'\'[[NME|New Musical Express]]\'\' called War "the best live band I ever saw" after their first UK gig in London\'s [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Their show at [[Ronnie Scott\'s Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott\'s Club]] in London on September 18, 1970 is historically notable for being the very last public performance for [[Jimi Hendrix]], who joined them onstage for the last 35 minutes of Burdon & War\'s 2nd set; a day later he was dead. A second Eric Burdon and War album, a [[double album|two-disc set]] titled \'\'[[The Black-Man\'s Burdon]]\'\' was released in 1970, before Burdon left the band in the middle of its European tour. They finished the tour without him and returned to record their first album as War.

\'\'[[War (War album)|War]]\'\' (1971) met with only modest success, but later that year, the band released \'\'[[All Day Music]]\'\' which included the singles "All Day Music" and "Slippin\' into Darkness". The latter single sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in June 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=305|isbn=0-214-20512-6}}</ref> In 1972 they released \'\'[[The World Is a Ghetto]]\'\' which was even more successful. Its second single, "The Cisco Kid" shipped gold,{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} and the album attained the number one spot on [[Billboard charts|Billboard]], and was Billboard magazine\'s Album of the Year as the best-selling album of 1973.

The next album, \'\'[[Deliver The Word]]\'\' (1973) contained the hits "Gypsy Man", and a studio version of "Me And Baby Brother" (previously issued as a live recording), which peaked at number 8 and 15 respectively on the Billboard chart. The album went on to sell nearly two million copies.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The next album, \'\'[[Why Can\'t We Be Friends?]]\'\' was released in 1975. It included "[[Low Rider (song)|Low Rider]]", and the title track, which were among the band\'s biggest hits.

In 1976, War released a [[greatest hits]] record which contained one new song "[[Summer (War song)|Summer]]", which, as a single, went gold and peaked at number 7 on the Billboard chart. Also released that year were \'\'[[Love Is All Around (album)|Love is All Around]]\'\' by Eric Burdon and War, containing mostly unreleased recordings from 1969 and 1970, and \'\'[[Platinum Jazz (album)|Platinum Jazz]]\'\', a one-off album for jazz label [[Blue Note Records]]. The latter double album had cover art to match the greatest hits album, and was half new material and half compilation, focusing on (but not restricted to) instrumental music. The group continued to attain success with their next album, \'\'Galaxy\'\' (1977) whose title single was inspired by \'\'[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]\'\'. War\'s next project was a soundtrack album for the movie \'\'[[Youngblood (1978 film)|Youngblood]]\'\' in 1978.

==1980s: The Music Band==
In 1979, following the departure of B.B. Dickerson during recording sessions for their next album (replaced by [[Luther Rabb]] on bass who completed the album), the band considered changing their name to The Music Band, but decided at the last minute to continue as War, and use \'\'The Music Band\'\' as the title of a series of albums. The series originally consisted of two studio albums (\'\'[[The Music Band]]\'\', \'\'[[The Music Band 2]]\'\', both in 1979) and a live album (\'\'The Music Band Live\'\', 1980), but after the band left MCA in 1981 and had already made records for other labels, MCA expanded the series with a compilation (\'\'The Best of the Music Band\'\', 1982) and a third original album of left-over material (\'\'[[The Music Band \xe2\x80\x93 Jazz]]\'\', 1983).

The group lost another member when Charles Miller (saxophone) was murdered in 1980. He had already been replaced by [[Pat Rizzo]] (ex [[Sly and the Family Stone]]) in 1979. Other new members joining at this time were Alice Tweed Smith (credited as "Tweed Smith" and "Alice Tweed Smyth" on various albums) on percussion and vocals (giving the band its first female vocalist), and Ronnie Hammon as a third drummer.

After making the one-off single "Cinco de Mayo" for LA Records in 1981 (Jerry Goldstein\'s own label, which also reissued \'\'Eric Burdon Declares "War"\'\' under the title \'\'Spill the Wine\'\' the same year), War signed with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]] and recorded \'\'[[Outlaw (War album)|Outlaw]]\'\' (1982) which included the single plus additional singles "You Got the Power", "Outlaw", and "Just Because". This was followed by \'\'[[Life (is So Strange)]]\'\' (1983) from which the title track was also a single. War\'s records from 1979 to 1983 were not as successful as those from the preceding decade, and after the two RCA albums, the band\'s activities became sporadic. They did not record another full album until a decade later. The 1987 compilation album \'\'The Best of War ...and More\'\' included two new tracks, "Livin\' in the Red" and "Whose Cadillac is That?", and a remixed version of "Low Rider" (in addition to the original version). Papa Dee Allen died of a heart attack ([[myocardial infarction]]) which struck him onstage in 1988.

==1990s: Reformations==
[[Sampling (music)|Sampling]] of War by hip hop artists was prevalent enough to merit the compilation album \'\'Rap Declares War\'\' in 1992, which was sanctioned by the band.

In 1993, War reformed with most surviving previous members (including original members Brown, Jordan, Oskar and Scott, and later members Hammon and Rizzo), augmented by a large line-up of supporting musicians and still under the management and production of Jerry Goldstein, and released a new album, [[Image:Peace symbol.svg|13px]] \'\'[[Peace Sign (War album)|(Peace Sign)]]\'\' (1994). 

In 1996, the group attempted to gain independence from Goldstein, but were unable to do so under the name "War" which remains a trademark owned by Goldstein and Far Out Productions.<ref>[http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/1369164] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> In response, Brown, Oskar, Scott, and a returning B.B. Dickerson (who had not worked with War since 1979) adopted a name which referenced one of War biggest hits: [[Lowrider Band]]. They are yet to record a studio album.

Lonnie Jordan opted to remain with Goldstein and create a new version of War with himself as the only original member. Some other musicians who had joined between 1983 and 1993 were also part of the new line-up. Both the "new" War and the [[Lowrider Band]] are currently active as live performance acts.

1996 also saw the release of a double CD compilation, \'\'Anthology (1970\xe2\x80\x931994)\'\', later updated in 2003 with a few track substitutions, as \'\'The Very Best of War\'\'. Another CD compilation from 1999, \'\'Grooves and Messages\'\', included a second disc of remixes done by various producers.

[[Image:Eric burdon and war concert flyer.jpg|thumb|right|2008 Reunion Flyer]]

==2000s==
On 21 April 2008, Eric Burdon and War reunited for the first time in 37 years to perform a one-time-only concert at the London Royal Albert Hall. The reunion was actually only between Eric Burdon and Lonnie Jordan, as the other original surviving members had not been asked to be a part of the reunion. The concert coincided with Avenue / [[Rhino Records]]\' Eric Burdon and War reissues which included \'\'Eric Burdon Declares "War"\'\' and \'\'The Black-Man\'s Burdon\'\', plus compilations \'\'The Best of Eric Burdon and War\'\' and \'\'Anthology\'\'. In 2008, Lonnie Jordan\'s edition of War released a live album / DVD of songs originally from 1969 to 1975: \'\'[[Greatest Hits Live (War album)|Greatest Hits Live]]\'\'. War were unsuccessfully nominated for 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/music/ny-etrockhall0922,0,3257546.story Run-D.M.C., Metallica nominated for Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Associated Press September 22, 2008]</ref> There were rumours that Burdon would join them again in summer 2009, but it did not happen. In 2011, War played "Low Rider" and many other hits at the Rack n\' Roll in Stamford, Connecticut with Remember September and Westchester School Of Rock.

In 2014 the "new" War released a new studio album Evolutionary.
Also in 2014, War were named as nominees for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/green-day-nine-inch-nails-smiths-nominated-for-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-20141009</ref>

\'\'\'Fred Wesley\'\'\' (born July 4, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] and [[funk]] [[trombonist]], best known for his work with [[James Brown]] in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in the second half of the 1970s.

==Biography==
Wesley was born the son of a high school teacher and [[big band]] leader in [[Columbus, Georgia]], and raised in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. As a child he took piano and later trumpet lessons. He played baritone horn and trombone in school, and at around age 12 his father brought a trombone home, whereupon he switched (eventually permanently) to trombone.<ref>[http://www.wcpn.org/index.php/WCPN/an/25744/ Wcpn.org]</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s he was a pivotal member of [[James Brown]]\'s bands, playing on many hit recordings including "[[Say it Loud - I\'m Black and I\'m Proud]]," "[[Mother Popcorn]]" and co-writing tunes such as "[[Hot Pants (James Brown song)|Hot Pants]]." His slippery riffs and pungent, precise solos, complementing those of saxophonist [[Maceo Parker]], gave Brown\'s [[R&B]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[funk]] tunes their instrumental punch. In the 1970s he also served as [[band leader]] and [[musical director]] of Brown\'s band [[the J.B.\'s]] and did much of the [[Composer|composing]] and [[Arrangement|arranging]] for the group. His name was credited on \'Fred Wesley & the J.B.\'s\' recording of "[[Doing It to Death]]," which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in July 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{Cite book

Wesley became a force in jazz in 1978 when he joined the [[Count Basie]] Orchestra. He released his first jazz [[album]] as a leader, \'\'To Someone\'\' in 1988. It was followed by \'\'New Friends\'\' in 1990, \'\'Comme Ci Comme Ca\'\' in 1991, the [[live album]] \'\'Swing and Be Funky\'\', and \'\'Amalgamation\'\' in 1994.

In the early 1990s Wesley toured with his colleagues from the James Brown band, [[Pee Wee Ellis]] and Maceo Parker, as the [[JB Horns]]. With the departure of Ellis the band became The Maceo Parker Band. Wesley was featured trombonist with Parker until 1996 when he formed his own band, The Fred Wesley Group, now known as Fred Wesley and the New JBs.

Wesley\'s 35-year career includes playing with and arranging for a wide variety of other artists including [[Ray Charles]], [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Randy Crawford]], [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]], [[The SOS Band]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Socalled]] and rappers [[De La Soul]], to name a few. Many other artists have [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] his work.

In 2002 Wesley wrote \'\'Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Sideman\'\', an [[autobiography]] about his life as a [[sideman]]. Also in 2002 he recorded an album entitled \'\'Wuda Cuda Shuda.\'\'

Wesley served as an adjunct professor in the Jazz Studies department of the School of Music at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] from 2004 to 2006, and now works with students as a visiting artist at numerous other schools including Berklee College of Music and Columbia College of Chicago. In addition to performing with his own band, he is currently touring as part of a collaboration called Abraham Inc. along with [[Klezmer]] artist [[David Krakauer]] and Klezmer/hip-hop artist [[Socalled]].

In 2007, Wesley accepted an invitation to contribute to \'\'[[Goin\' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]\'\' ([[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]]).  He participated with [[Lenny Kravitz]], the [[Rebirth Brass Band]], [[Troy "Trombone Shorty" Andrews]], [[Pee Wee Ellis]] and [[Maceo Parker]] to contribute their version of Domino\'s "Whole Lotta Lovin\'."

In 2010, Wesley contributed to \'\'Kings\'\' (Freestyle Records), the fourth album by Israeli [[Funk]] and [[Groove (music)|Groove]] ensemble, The Apples. Specific sessions on the album were dedicated to working with Wesley, one of the group\'s heroes.<ref>[http://www.parisdjs.com/index.php/post/The-Apples-Kings Review of \'\'Kings\'\']; www.parisdjs.com.   Wesley contributes to the tracks "Howlin\' With Fred", "In The Air", "All Right All Right" and "Kings".</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], her performing career started as early as three years old while touring with her family\'s [[Gospel music|gospel]] group, the Manning Gospel Singers.  At the age of 16 she joined the Alma Whitney Singers and two years later she married singer Harry Whitney with whom she had a daughter. She began singing R&B music for the first time in 1963 at a Kansas City venue.<ref name = "Sevier and Shipley">Eccentric Soul: The Forte label, Sleeve notes by Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley, published May 2013</ref> and studied music at college. Whilst working at a garment factory, she continued performing in nightclubs and at local talent competitions, and by the mid-1960s had joined local group Tommy (Gadson) & The Derbys as their lead singer.  The group opened for many leading performers passing through Kansas City.  In 1967, she left the group, and turned down offers to tour with [[Bobby Bland]] and [[Little Richard]] before joining the [[James Brown]] Revue as a featured vocalist.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name=wefunk>[http://www.wefunkradio.com/show/2006-11-10 Telephone interview with Marva Whitney at WeFunk Radio], November 2006. Retrieved 24 December 2012</ref> Her marriage to Whitney had ended in divorce in 1965. Subsequently she was married, albeit briefly to disc jockey Phil Wardell.<ref name = "Sevier and Shipley">Eccentric Soul: The Forte Label, Sleeve notes by Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley, published May 2013</ref>

===Career===
Her first solo single, "Your Love Was Good To Me", was recorded for [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] in mid-1967, but was unsuccessful as were two follow-up singles.  She toured Europe, Asia and Africa with James Brown with whom she was in a relationship, and in early 1968 he produced her fourth solo single, "Unwind Yourself", in a more funky style.<ref name=wefunk/>  Although the record was not a chart hit, it was later [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] numerous times, most recognisably by DJ Mark the 45 King on his 1987 track "The 900 Number", which was then sampled by DJ [[Chad Jackson (DJ)|Chad Jackson]] on his 1990 hit single "[[Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)]]" (UK number 3 in July 1990), by [[DJ Kool]] on his 1996 hit "[[Let Me Clear My Throat]]" (UK number 6 in March 1997), [[Sway (rapper)|Sway]] on his 2009 track "[[Mercedes Benz (Sway song)|Mercedes Benz]]" and [[Mac Miller]] on his 2011 track "[[Party on Fifth Ave.]]"

Whitney\'s first chart hit came with "It\'s My Thing (You Can\'t Tell Me Who to Sock It To)," a response to [[The Isley Brothers]]\' hit "[[It\'s Your Thing]]"; her record reached number 19 on the \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]] and number 82 on the [[Hot 100]] in 1969.  She followed up with two smaller hits, "Things Got To Get Better (Get Together)" (R&B number 22) and "I Made A Mistake Because It\'s Only You Pt. 1" (R&B number 32),<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=479}}</ref>  and also made a name for herself with powerful songs like "I\'m Tired, I\'m Tired, I\'m Tired (Things Better Change Before Its Too Late)", and "If You Don\'t Work (You Can\'t Eat)."  After recording three albums - \'\'Unwind Yourself\'\' (1968), \'\'Live and Lowdown at the Apollo\'\' (1969) and \'\'It\'s My Thing\'\' (1969) - and about 13 singles with James Brown as producer and writer or co-writer,an exhausted Whitney left the Brown stable in 1969 (or 1970) and returned to Kansas City.<ref name=allmusic/><ref name = "Sevier and Shipley">Eccentric Soul: The Forte Label, Sleeve notes by Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley, published May 2013</ref><ref name=wefunk/>

Clarence Cooper and Allan Bell took over her management and initially struggled to get Whitney into major venues. A trip to Chicago in 1970 and a visit to producer Floyd Smith resulted in a contract for the Isley Brothers\' [[T-Neck Records|T-Neck]] label. After divorcing Phil Wardell, she married Ellis Taylor of Forte Records with whom she had a son, and recorded further singles for the label, including "Daddy Don\'t Know About Sugar Bear", her most successful post Brown single that was picked up for national distribution by Nashville\'s [[Excello Records|Excello]] records. She retired from recording for several years making only local appearances in Kansas City,<ref name = "Sevier and Shipley">Eccentric Soul: The Forte Label, Sleeve notes by Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley, published May 2013</ref> returning to the studio in 1977 for a Forte single with her brother Melvin Manning. She divorced Taylor in 1977 and relocated to Los Angeles for the next fifteen years.

In the early 1980s, she briefly joined a group, Coffee, Cream & Sugar, formed by singer Alfred "Pico" Payne.  Later in the 1980s, she started to perform regularly with former James Brown band members such as [[Maceo Parker]], [[Fred Wesley]], [[Pee Wee Ellis]], and [[Lyn Collins]], as the JB Allstars.<ref name=wefunk/> She returned to Kansas City as it became apparent that Funk music was essentially unfashionable and opportunities were sparse. She later married for the fourth time a preacher and returned to her gospel roots.<ref name = "Sevier and Shipley">Eccentric Soul: The Forte Label, Sleeve notes by Rob Sevier and Ken Shipley, published May 2013</ref>

In 2006, Whitney collaborated with German born DJ/collector/manager [[DJ Pari]] and Japanese funk orchestra [[Osaka Monaurail]] to produce a new single, "I Am What I Am". Osaka Monaurail style themselves on the James Brown sound and the single was produced in the fashion of an authentic release of the recordings she produced with Brown in 1969. Two successful tours of Japan and a full length album release followed, also entitled "I Am What I Am". In 2007, 2008 and 2009, the tour was also brought to Europe where she maintained a cult following.

===Illness and death===
In December 2009, Whitney collapsed on stage in front of thousands of fans in [[Lorne, Victoria|Lorne]], [[Australia]], while performing with [[The Transatlantics]] at Falls Festival. She was immediately rushed to [[Geelong Hospital]], where doctors diagnosed a stroke. The remaining dates of her tour had to be canceled, but Whitney made a partial recovery and performed again in 2010.  In December 2012, Whitney died from complications of [[pneumonia]] at her home. She was 68.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/arts/music/marva-whitney-singer-in-the-james-brown-revue-dies-at-68.html?_r=0|title=Marva Whitney, Singer in the James Brown Revue, Dies at 68|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jon Caramanica|date=2012-12-31|accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

==Career==

===1992\xe2\x80\x9397: Early career===
Through working with Riley, Williams went on to write a verse and help produce for [[Wreckx-N-Effect]]\'s 1992 hit "[[Rump Shaker (song)|Rump Shaker]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kimpel|first=Dan|title=How They Made It|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2006|pages=124\xe2\x80\x93125|isbn=0-634-07642-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wDyd16CHUu4C&pg=PA124&dq=pharrell+williams&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=2009&as_maxm_is=12&as_maxy_is=2009&as_brr=0&as_pt=BOOKS|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> That same year, he also performed a small rap solo on [[SWV]]\'s second hit, "Right Here (UK Remix)". Williams and Hugo met rap duo [[Clipse]] in [[Virginia Beach]] in 1993, where they were signed to [[Arista Records]] through Williams\' [[Star Trak Entertainment]] imprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/clipse/articles/story/5938804/new_faces_the_clipse|title=New Faces: The Clipse |last=Brackett|first=Nathan|date=September 13, 2002|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref><ref name="Yale Daily News">{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/19305|title=Rap duo \'Clipse\' rocks the gangsta hip-hop scene|last=Torbati|first=June|date=December 8, 2006|work=[[Yale Daily News]]|accessdate=2009-03-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 1994, Hugo and Williams had established themselves as a production duo under their old name "The Neptunes", and assistant-produced "Tonight\'s The Night" from [[Blackstreet]]\'s [[Blackstreet (album)|self-titled album]]. Over the next three years they continued to produce occasionally, and some of the results had little resemblance to the Neptunes\' sound later. However, some like [[Mase]]\'s 1997 song "Lookin\' at Me" from his album \'\'[[Harlem World]]\'\', and the most definite beginning of the distinctive "Neptunes sound", came with [[N.O.R.E]]\'s "Superthug" in 1998, reaching number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]], and gaining them widespread attention for the first time. In 1999, a mutual friend introduced Williams to [[Kelis]], and their resulting collaboration produced her first album \'\'[[Kaleidoscope (Kelis album)|Kaleidoscope]]\'\'.

===1998\xe2\x80\x932004: The Neptunes===
[[File:PHARRELL WILLIAMS by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|left|Pharrell Williams in [[Berlin]], March 2005]]
At this point the Neptunes were gaining a wide fanbase and audience.
In 2001, the Neptunes produced [[Britney Spears]]\' single, "[[I\'m a Slave 4 U]]" gaining their first worldwide number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449404/20010928/nerd.jhtml|title=Neptunes\xe2\x80\x99 Pharrell Williams Rethinks R&B|work=MTV News|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> The same year, [[N.E.R.D|N*E*R*D]], consisting of Williams, Hugo and Haley, released their first album, \'\'[[In Search Of... (N.E.R.D album)|In Search of...]]\'\', in Europe, where the first Kelis album was better received. The album sounded very much like their previous production work; the group decided that they should make their work as [[N.E.R.D|N*E*R*D]] sound different, and re-recorded the album with the rock band [[Spymob]].

Then in 2002 their re-produced album was released worldwide, and the Neptunes reached number one in the U.S. with Nelly\'s single, "[[Hot in Herre]]". In August of the same year, the Neptunes were named "Producers of the Year" at both [[The Source (magazine)|the Source Awards]] and the [[Billboard Music Award]]s. [[Clipse]] released their commercial debut album \'\'[[Lord Willin\']]\'\' in August 2002. The album started at number one on the \'\'Billboard\'\' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and number four on the [[Billboard 200|\'\'Billboard\'\' 200]], fueled by its first two singles, "[[Grindin\']]" and "[[When the Last Time]]", which peaked at number 34 and number 19 respectively on the \'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100.

The Neptunes released a self-credited album called \'\'[[Clones (album)|The Neptunes Present... Clones]]\'\' in 2003, with songs and remixes from various artists. This topped the U.S. \'\'Billboard\'\' 200 Albums Chart. The Neptunes and Williams specifically were also kept in public eye largely due to ties with [[Jay-Z]], producing several hit singles for him and two tracks on his \'\'[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]\'\'. The track "[[Frontin\']]" was a big hit (the 34th biggest of 2003 according to \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\').

On September 9, 2005, Williams performed the opening single from his first solo album \'\'[[In My Mind (Pharrell album)|In My Mind]]\'\', "[[Can I Have It Like That]]", featuring [[Gwen Stefani]].

\'\'\'Womack & Womack\'\'\' was the singing and songwriting partnership of [[Americans|American]] musicians [[Cecil Womack]] and his wife, [[Linda Womack]]. The duo were successful as songwriters for other artists, and had several international hits as a singing duo in the 1980s and 1990s. Later recordings, with other members of their family, were credited to \'\'\'The House of Zekkariyas\'\'\'.

==Background==
[[Cecil Womack]] was born in 1947 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and performed with his older brothers [[Bobby Womack|Bobby]] (1944\xe2\x80\x932014), [[Harry Womack|Harry]] (1945\xe2\x80\x931974), Friendly and Curtis, as a [[gospel music|gospel]] [[musical group|group]]. After meeting [[Sam Cooke]], they changed their name to [[The Valentinos]] and in 1961 began to sing and record "the devil\'s music" for secular audiences, to the horror of their religious father.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web|author=Pierre Perrone |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cecil-womack-half-of-the-husbandandwife-duo-known-for-their-soul-hits-of-the-1980s-8489040.html |title=Cecil Womack: Half of the husband-and-wife duo known for their soul hits of the 1980s - Obituaries - News |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> The Valentinos had a hit record with "[[Lookin\' for a Love]]," selling two million copies, later becoming a no. 39 U.S. hit for [[The J. Geils Band]] in 1971.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> They toured with  [[James Brown]] and scored another crossover hit with \xe2\x80\x9c[[It\'s All Over Now]]\xe2\x80\x9d, a song which subsequently reached no. 1 in the UK when [[cover version|covered]] by [[The Rolling Stones]] in 1964.<ref>[http://www.soultracks.com/womack_and_womack.htm Soultracks.com: Womack and Womack biography].

Retrieved 5 February 2013</ref>

In the 1960s, Cecil Womack worked primarily as a songwriter and producer. He first met Linda, who is Sam Cooke\'s daughter, born in 1953, when he was thirteen and she was eight.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Womack%20&%20Womack.html |title=Womack & Womack Page |publisher=Soulwalking.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> Although Linda and Cecil were close, particularly after her father\'s death in 1964, he married singer  [[Mary Wells]] in 1967 and wrote material for her, including the hit "[[The Doctor (Mary Wells song)|The Doctor]]", released on Jubilee Records. They had three children, and he managed her career until their break-up in 1977.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> Linda Cooke also worked as a songwriter, co-writing Bobby Womack\'s "[[Woman\'s Gotta Have It (song)|Woman\'s Gotta Have It]]."<ref>[http://www.noise11.com/news/cecil-womack-dies-at-age-65-20130204  VVN Music, \'\'Cecil Womack Dies At Age 65\'\', Noise 11, 4 February 2013].

==Performers==
In 1983, Cecil and Linda began performing and recording together as Womack & Womack, and released a successful album, \'\'[[Love Wars]]\'\' produced by [[Stewart Levine]] on [[Elektra Records]]. The first single from the album, "T.K.O.", reached the  \'\'[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\'\' [[R&B chart]]; the next single, "Love Wars", reached no.14 on the [[UK singles chart]] in early 1984, and the third single from the album, "Baby I\'m Scared Of You", was successful in both the US (no. 25, R&B chart) and the UK (no. 72).<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-1995|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=1996 |publisher=Record Research |page=491}}</ref><ref name="betts">{{cite book| first= Graham| last= Betts| year=2004| title= Complete UK Hit Singles 1952-2004| edition= 1st|publisher= Collins| location= London| isbn= 0-00-717931-6| page=856}}</ref> As with most of the tracks they recorded together, the songs were written by the pair. Drawing from their own, convoluted, personal experiences, Cecil and Linda, knowing each other since childhood, were experts at capturing the trials, travails and tribulations of love.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> Their next album, the self-produced  \'\'Radio M.U.S.C. Man,\'\' released in 1986, included songs which Sam Cooke had started to write and which Cecil and Linda completed, along with a cover of the [[Beatles]]\' "[[Here Comes The Sun]]". The album only produced one hit, "Strange & Funny", the pair\'s last chart entry in the US, and they left Elektra to record for the  [[Manhattan Records|Manhattan]] label.<ref name="whitburnr&b"/> Their only release for the label, 1986\'s "\'\'Starbright,\'\'" an ill-fated stab at the charts with little of their past sound, was barely released in the U.S., but produced a single, "Soul Love/Soul Man" that reached no. 58 in the U.K. Always popular in England, they headlined at the  [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1987.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/>

Their success in the UK and other parts of the world was rekindled in 1988 with the "naggingly catchy"<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> single "[[Teardrops (Womack & Womack song)|Teardrops]]", taken from their fourth album (and first for the [[Fourth & Broadway Records|Fourth & Broadway]] label), \'\'[[Conscience (Womack & Womack album)|Conscience]]\'\'. The single reached no. 3 in the U.K., no. 1 in [[The Netherlands]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]; and no. 2 in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].<ref>[http://tsort.info/music/yr1988.htm  The World\'s Music Chart: Songs from the year 1988].  retrieved 4 February 2013</ref> Two other album tracks charted in England, "Life\'s Just A Ballgame" (U.K. no. 32) and "Celebrate The World" (U.K. no. 19).<ref name="betts"/> The album itself went gold in ten countries and platinum in three.<ref>Liner Notes "Womack & Womack: Live In Conceet" DVD</ref> An eleven song  [[DVD]], \'\'Womack & Womack: Live In Concert\'\' was released in 1989, filmed during their "Celebrate The World" tour in Australia, America, England, Spain and France. It was re-released in 2009 by Cherry Red Films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk |title=Cherry Red Records |publisher=Cherryred.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>

Their next album, 1991\'s \'\'Family Spirit\'\' was released on [[RCA]] in the U.S., and [[BMG]]/[[Arista Records|Arista]] in the rest of the world. It didn\'t chart, but the single "Uptown" was a club hit. After traveling to [[Nigeria]], they discovered ancestral ties to the Zekkariyas tribe, and adopted African names. Now recording for  [[Warner Bros. Records]], in 1993 they released what was to be their last album of new material under the name of Womack & Womack, \'\'Transformation To The House Of Zekkariyas\'\'.<ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/womack-womack-mn0000680374  Biography by William Ruhlmann at Allmusic.com].

The Womacks, now using their adopted African name Zekkariyas, began recording as a family. Zek (Cecil) and Zeriiya (Linda), along with their children Zeumoja, Zeniya, Zeimani, and Zeapree, Lil Squal, and long-time backing group \'\'Sly, Slick & Wicked\'\', released \'\'Sub Conscience\'\' aka \'\'Subconscience\'\' as \'\'ZEK\'\' in 2001 on their own \'\'Z Life Grooves\'\' label. ZEK is short for Zekkariyas Enlightenment Kingdom. Basically a re-working of various tracks from throughout their career, a companion remix album, \'\'Circular Motion\'\' was released in 2004 on their \'\'S.A.R. Starship\'\' imprint, not 2007 as erroneously listed in many references.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/circular-motion-mw0001706255  \'\'Circular Motion\'\' at Allmusic.com].  Retrieved 3 February 2013</ref> The original [[SAR Records]] was [[Sam Cooke]]\'s record label.

==Songwriters==
Linda commenced a songwriting career in 1964 at the age of 11, composing "I Need A Woman", and would also co-write "I\'m In Love" for [[Wilson Pickett]] and "A Woman\'s Gotta Have It" in 1972 for [[Bobby Womack]]. It was also recorded by  [[James Taylor]], along with many others.<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> Cecil had also written numerous songs, sometimes collaborating with then wife [[Mary Wells]]. After beginning her personal and professional relationship with Cecil, the pair started their career working as a writing team for  [[Philadelphia International Records]]. They composed tracks for artists such as  [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[The Dramatics]], [[The O\'Jays]] ("I Just Want To Satisfy") and [[Patti LaBelle]] ("Love Symphony").<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> The pair\'s "[[Love TKO]]" was a major hit for [[Teddy Pendergrass]], and was later recorded by several artists, including [[Debbie Harry]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Boz Scaggs]] and [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]].<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> On their own they hit a creative purple patch, composing material that went on to be recorded by [[George Benson]] ("New Day"), [[Eric Clapton]] ("Lead Me On"), [[Bonnie Raitt]] ("Good Man, Good Woman") and "I Wish I Had Someone To Go Home To" for brother Bobby Womack.. The title track of their first album, "Love Wars," was covered by  [[The Beautiful South]] for the 1990 [[Elektra Records]] anniversary compilation \'\'[[Rub\xc3\xa1iy\xc3\xa1t]]\'\', and "[[Teardrops (Womack & Womack song)|Teardrops]]" has been recorded by [[k.d. lang]], [[Elton John]] and [[Joss Stone]].<ref name="soulwalking.co.uk"/> The Womacks also wrote and produced for [[Culture Club]] and [[Bryan Ferry]] backup vocalist turned solo artist [[Ruby Turner]]. Her album  \'\'Paradise\'\' featured their songs "Sexy" and "See Me," while they wrote and produced four cuts on her next album \'\'The Other Side\'\'.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex Henderson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-other-side-mw0000263692 |title=The Other Side - Ruby Turner &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>

==Early life==

Regi began to teach Victor to play bass when he was two, and by the age of six, Victor was performing with his brothers in their family band, The Wooten Brothers Band.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brodkin|first=Fran|url=http://www.montgomerynews.com/articles/2013/11/29/entertainment/doc529619829c4fb272076613.txt|title=The Wootens: Band of brothers grow up with music and values|date=2013-11-29|publisher=montgomerynews.com|accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref> As an United States Air Force family, they moved around a lot when Victor was very young, finally settling in the Warwick Lawns neighborhood of [[Newport News, Virginia]] in 1972. He graduated from [[Denbigh High School (Newport News, Virginia)|Denbigh High School]] in 1982. While in high school, Victor and his brothers played in the country music revue at [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg|Busch Gardens]] theme park in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]].

==Instruments==
[[File:Victor Wooten.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wooten playing his [[Steinberger]] headless bass guitar at the \'\'[[Belly Up]]\'\' in 2006.]]
Wooten is most often seen playing [[Fodera]] basses, of which he has a signature model. His most famous Fodera, a 1983 Monarch Deluxe he refers to as "number 1," sports a [[Kahler Tremolo System]] model 2400 bridge. Fodera\'s "Yin Yang" basses (co-designed by and created for Wooten) incorporates the [[Yin and yang|Yin Yang symbol]]\xe2\x80\x94which Wooten uses in various media\xe2\x80\x94as a focal point of the top\'s design and construction. The symbol is created from two pieces of naturally finished wood (Ebony and Holly, for example), fitted together to create the Yin-Yang pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306035134/http://www.fodera.com/vw_yy_4.html|title=Victor Wooten Yin Yang 4 String|publisher=fodera.com|accessdate=2013-12-25}}</ref> As well as playing electric bass (both fretted and fretless) and the double bass, Victor also played the cello in high school. He still plays cello occasionally with the Flecktones as well as in the 2012 Sword and Stone/Words and Tones tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Playing with Words and Music|url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2012/10/04/playing-with-words-and-music-an-interview-with-victor-wooten-part-3/|website=NoTreble|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> This is the instrument to which he attributes his musical training.

Wooten has also experimented with backward vocals, chanting, and Asian percussion.

\'\'\'George Bernard "Bernie" Worrell, Jr.\'\'\' (born April 19, 1944) is an American [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] and [[composer]] best known as a founding member of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and for his work with [[Talking Heads]]. He is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

==Biography==

===Funk and soul===
Worrell was born in [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]], [[New Jersey]] and grew up in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]]. A musical [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], he learned to play the piano by age three and wrote a [[concerto]] at age eight. He went on to study at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] and the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].

As a college student around 1970, Worrell played with a group called Chubby & The Turnpikes (later to be known as [[Tavares (band)|Tavares]]).  The drummer in that band was [[Joey Kramer]], who left in October 1970 to be a founding member of the rock band [[Aerosmith]].  He then met [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], then the leader of a [[doo wop]] group called [[The Parliaments]].  Soon, Worrell, Clinton, The Parliaments and their backing band ([[Funkadelic]]) moved to [[Detroit, Michigan]], and became [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]].  During the 1970s the same group of musicians toured and recorded under both the Parliament and Funkadelic names as well as several others, collectively known as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]. Worrell was a central figure in the group. He played the piano, keyboards and organ in both groups and co-wrote or did the [[arrangement]]s for many of the bands\' hits. He debuted the keyboard synthesizer bass in popular music on the Parliament song "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]". He also recorded a [[1978 in music|1978]] album with the group, \'\'[[All the Woo in the World]]\'\', under his own name.

While funk musicians traditionally utilized electric keyboards, such as the [[Hammond organ]] and [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano, Bernie Worrell created Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive riffs with a [[Minimoog]] synthesizer, and was the second recipient of the instrument created by [[Bob Moog]]. He used [[ARP Pro Soloist]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Bosso |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/bernie-worrell-talks-vintage-synths-elp-parliament-funkadelic-talking-heads-and-more-576154/ |title=Bernie Worrell talks vintage synths, ELP, Parliament/ Funkadelic, Talking Heads and more |publisher=Musicradar.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> Worrell\xe2\x80\x99s synthesizer work is prominent on the majority of Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s most popular (and most [[Sampling (music)|sampled]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} songs throughout the 1970s, most notably \xe2\x80\x9d[[Mothership Connection (Star Child)]]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[[Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)]]\xe2\x80\x9d from \'\'[[Mothership Connection]]\'\', "[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]" from \'\'[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]\'\' and "[[Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)|Aqua Boogie]]" from \'\'[[Motor Booty Affair]]\'\'.

=== Alternative Music ===
After the original Parliament-Funkadelic stopped touring in the early 1980s, Worrell released several solo albums. He was recruited, along with other musicians from differing [[genre]]s such as [[Adrian Belew]], to perform and record with [[Talking Heads]], a pioneering [[new wave music|new wave]] act. Worrell\'s experience and feel for different arrangements enhanced the overall sound of the band. Though he never officially joined Talking Heads, he was a \'\'[[de facto]]\'\' member of the group for most of the \'80s, appearing on one of their studio albums, several solo albums, and multiple tours until they officially disbanded in 1992. Worrell can be seen in the Talking Heads concert film \'\'[[Stop Making Sense]]\'\'.  Worrell was invited to perform with Talking Heads at their one-off reunion as part of their 2002 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Worrell also co-produced [[Fred Schneider]]\'s 1984 solo album \'\'[[Fred Schneider & the Shake Society]]\'\', and played keyboards and synthesizers on some of the album\'s tracks.

Since the late 1980s, Worrell has recorded extensively with [[Bill Laswell]], including Sly and Robbie\'s Laswell-produced \'\'[[Rhythm Killers]]\'\' and the 1985 [[Fela Kuti]] album \'\'Army Arrangement\'\'. Worrell has also performed with [[Gov\'t Mule]]. Through the beginning of the 21st century, he has become a visible member of the [[jam band]] scene, performing in many large summer festivals, sometimes billed as Bernie Worrell and the Woo Warriors. These new funk, groove, and rock bands have embraced Worrell\'s historical relevance and immense talent.  He has appeared on many [[Jack Bruce]] albums, including \'\'A Question of Time\'\', \'\'Cities of the Heart\'\', \'\'Monkjack\'\', and \'\'More Jack Than God\'\'.

In 1994, Worrell appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]\'s compilation album, \'\'[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]\'\'.  The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as "Album of the Year" by [[Time Magazine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Stolen Moments: Red Hot &amp; Cool |url=http://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Moments-Red-Hot-Cool/dp/B0000083QR/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1292048338&sr=8-1 |title=Stolen Moments: Red Hot & Cool: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>

Worrell has since joined the rock group Black Jack Johnson, with [[Mos Def]], [[Will Calhoun]], [[Doug Wimbish]] and [[Dr. Know (guitarist)|Dr. Know]].  He appears with the band on Mos Def\'s 2004 release [[The New Danger]].

Worrell joined forces with bass legend [[Les Claypool]], guitarist [[Buckethead]], and drummer [[Bryan Mantia]] to form the group [[Colonel Claypool\'s Bucket of Bernie Brains]].

In 2005, Worrell collaborated with [[Bo Diddley]] producer and [[Original P]] guitarist/vocalist [[Scott "Skyntyte" Free]], on the album \'\'BananAtomic Mass\'\' by "Munkeez Strikin\' Matchiz".
Worrell\'s presence is heard throughout, as each of the albums tracks contains an original classical-styled interlude performed by Worrell.  He, Diddley and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] cofounder [[Chuck D]] are featured performers on the song "Wreck It", which is the last studio recording by Diddley.

His project Baby Elephant is a collaboration with [[Stetsasonic]] member/[[De La Soul]] producer [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] and longtime Paul associate [[Don Newkirk]]. Released September 11, 2007, \'\'Turn My Teeth Up!\'\', features George Clinton, [[Shock G]], [[Yellowman]], [[Reggie Watts]], [[Nona Hendryx]], [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Gabby La La]]. In 2009 he joined with longtime Parliament-Funkadelic guitarist and musical director [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]], bassist [[Melvin Gibbs]] and drummer J.T. Lewis to form the band "SociaLybrium". Their album "For You/For Us/For All" was released on Livewired Music in January 2010.

Worrell appears in the 2004 documentary film \'\'[[Moog (film)|Moog]]\'\' with synthesizer pioneer Bob Moog and several other Moog synthesizer musicians. In 2011, he toured with [[Bootsy Collins]], another major figure of Parliament-Funkadelic.

Since 2011, Worrell has been performing with his group, the Bernie Worrell Orchestra. Known for special guest appearances, [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Tina Weymouth]], [[Chris Frantz]], [[Jimmy Destri]], [[Mike Watt]], [[Rah Digga]] and [[Gary Lucas]] are some of the artists who have sat in with the group during live performances.

As of 2012, Worrell is touring with [[Steve Kimock]], [[Wally Ingram]] and [[Andy Hess]].

Worrell has been a resident of [[Hampton, New Jersey]].<ref>Jordan, Chris.

\'\'\'Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band\'\'\' is a pioneering [[United States|American]] [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk music|funk]] [[band (music)|band]]. Formed in the early 1960s, they had the most visibility from 1967 to 1973 when the band had 9 singles reach [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard\'s]] pop and/or [[rhythm and blues]] [[Hot 100]] lists, such as "Do Your Thing" (#11 Pop, #12 R&B), "Till You Get Enough" (#12 R&B, #67 Pop), and "[[Love Land (song)|Love Land]]" (R&B #23, Pop #16). They are best known for their biggest hit on [[Warner Bros. Records]], 1970\'s "[[Express Yourself (Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band song)|Express Yourself]]" (#3 R&B, #12 Pop), a song that has been sampled by rap group N.W.A. and others.

==History==

===Charles Wright and the Wright Sounds===
Charles Wright was born on April 6, 1940 in [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]].<ref>[http://www.charliegillett.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=17712  Charles Wright (6th April Birthday), \'\'CharlieGillett.com\'\']. Retrieved 27 September 2014</ref>    He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1950s, playing [[guitar]] and singing in several [[doo-wop]] groups including the Turks, the Twilighters, the Shields and the Gallahads. He also briefly worked as an [[A&R]] for [[Del-Fi Records]] and was responsible for the "Hit" record "Those Oldies But Goodies" (Remind me of you) by Little Caesar and the Romans in 1961. In 1962, he formed his own band Charles Wright & the Wright Sounds which included future Watts Band member, John Raynford, along with [[Daryl Dragon]], aka "Captain" of [[Captain & Tennille]]. Over the course of the next six years, Wright would add more players to his group and these were the players who would eventually become known as the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, at least by 1968. Several of those members, namely [[drummer]] [[James Gadson]], [[bassist]] Melvin Dunlap, [[trombonist]]/[[arranger]] Ray Jackson, and both [[guitarist]]s Al McKay and Benorce Blackmon, would play on several [[Dyke & the Blazers]] charting singles, including "We Got More Soul" (1969) and "Let a Woman Be a Woman, Let a Man Be a Man" (1969).

The Wright Sounds played in several venues across Los Angeles but their best known stint was three years (ending in 1968) at [[Hollywood|Hollywood\'s]] Haunted House nightclub. Originally located at Hollywood and Vine, the Haunted House was a popular club in the 1960s and appears in several popular culture artifacts, most notably the 1969 go-go dancing B-movie, \'\'[[Girl in Gold Boots]]\'\'.

Wright\'s nephew was the rapper [[Eazy-E]], a successful solo artist and member of infamous [[hip-hop]] group [[N.W.A.]]. Eazy-E, whose real name was Eric Lynn Wright, died of [[AIDS]] on March 26, 1995 at the age of 31.

===First Watts 103rd Band===
The name, Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band was originally coined by Los Angeles producer and Keymen Records owner Fred Smith in 1967. However, between 1967 and 1968, the Watts 103rd name applied to three, arguably four different personnel configurations before settling into the final band who played on every Watts 103rd album from 1968 forward.<ref name="Wang2008">Wang, Oliver (2008). \'\'Charles Wright and the Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band: Live at the Haunted House - May 18, 1968\'\' [CD liner notes]. Rhino Handmade.</ref>

Smith produced a theme song for [[KYPA|KGFJ]] radio personality, DJ [[Magnificent Montague]]. The song became so popular that Smith released it as a single in 1967 and created the name, Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band for the studio group who had recorded it. Purportedly, the players on the single included Wright, James Carmichael, [[Leon Haywood]], and [[Bobby Womack]].<ref>Hill, Edward (2006). "The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band." [CD liner notes]. Water Records.</ref>

There is some confusion because, after "Spreadin\' Honey" became a success, Montague re-released the single on the MoSoul label (a Keyman subsidiary) and credited to a different group altogether, the Soul Runners. It has been long assumed that the Soul Runners were simply an earlier line-up of the Watts Band however, according to Wright, the two groups had nothing to do with one another whatsoever.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2001). "Charles Wright and the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band." \'\'Funk.\'\' San Francisco: Backbeat Books. pp. 203-206.</ref>

===Second Watts 103rd Band===
In 1966, Carmichael and Wright were both working as session players for the Nashville West [[recording studio]]. Their group of studio players was discovered by Fred Smith and comedian [[Bill Cosby]] who needed a backing band for his upcoming album, \'\'[[Silver Throat]]\'\'. Smith hired the Nashville West players and gave them the Watts 103rd name. This group included (but was not necessarily limited to): Arthur Wright (bass), Pete Fox (guitar), [[Streamline Ewing]] (trombone), Herman Riley (tenor sax), Jackie Kelso (tenor sax), Melvin Jernigan (tenor sax), [[Mel Brown (guitarist)|Mel Brown]] (guitar), Abraham Mills (drums).<ref name="Wang2008"/>

Due to their association with Cosby, the new Watts 103rd band landed a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]], becoming the first [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] band to sign with them. They released a debut album in 1967. Technically self-titled, the album has also come to be called \'\'Hot Heat & Sweet Groove\'\' after a sub-title found on the back cover. "Spreadin\' Honey" was included on this album, per Warner Bros. insistence, even though none of the players on the album, save for Wright, had actually played on the "Spreadin\' Honey" single.<ref name="Wang2008"/>

Wright generally disavows this album as a true Watts 103rd project, preferring to describe the second album, \'\'Together\'\' as the "first" Watts 103rd [[LP album|LP]].

===Third Watts 103rd Band===
When Cosby went on tour, Wright was put in charge with creating a Watts 103rd touring band which included both the musicians he had just recorded \'\'Hot Heat\'\' with but also added in the Wright Sounds as well. The Haunted House also began to bill Wright and the Wright Sounds as the Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band.

===Final Watts 103rd Band===
Creative disagreements led to Smith selling his interest in the group to Wright. Newly freed, Wright reformed the Watts 103rd exclusively out of his Wright Sounds players and broke ties with the musicians he had recorded \'\'Hot Heat\'\' with.

A May 18, 1968 recording of a live session at the Haunted House  became the partial basis for the second Warner Bros. album, \'\'Together\'\'.<ref name="Wang2008"/> That album yielded the group\'s first major national hit, the slow grooving "Do Your Thing." 

Their next album, \'\'In the Jungle Babe,\'\' is best known for both "Love Land," an uptempo, doo-wop-influenced soul ballad, as well as "Comment," where Wright discusses the state of racial affairs in America. Though the album was credited to the Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band, the singles from this album and the group\'s next two albums, would be listed under "Charles Wright and the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band".

In the band\'s early years, they were mostly known for playing covers of popular R&B hits but by the late 1960s, the group began to create original songs, resulting in a sound that was, as Charles Wright put it, "the middle ground between [[Otis Redding]] and [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]]",<ref>[http://www.expressyourself.net/index.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> reflecting the group\'s musical blend of different regional R&B and [[funk]] styles. Their experiments in long, loosely structured [[groove (music)|grooves]],  best heard on the \'\'Express Yourself\'\' and \'\'You\'re So Beautiful\'\' albums, could be heard as both influences on and influenced by contemporaries such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], the [[Isley Brothers]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

===Dissolution===
As early as 1969, the Watts Band began to lose members. Al McKay left the Watts Band in 1969 and soon joined [[Earth, Wind & Fire]].  He was replaced by Benorce Blackmon. After recording the 1971, \'\'You\'re So Beautiful\'\' album, Gadson, Dunlap, Jackson, and Blackmon left the Watts Band to work with [[Bill Withers]], playing on the albums \'\'[[Still Bill]]\'\' (1972) and \'\'[[Live at Carnegie Hall (Bill Withers album)|Live at Carnegie Hall]]\'\' (1973). 

Charles Wright went on to record four solo records after the departure of the Watts Band\'s core rhythm section, \'\'Rhythm and Poetry\'\' (1972), \'\'Doin\' What Comes Naturally\'\' (1973), \'\'Ninety Day Cycle People\'\' (1974), and \'\'Lil\' Encouragement\'\' (1975). In 2007, he released a new album, \'\'Finally Got It Wright,\'\' which includes an updated version of "Express Yourself."

"Express Yourself" was remixed by L.A. rap group [[N.W.A.]] in 1988 and has been used for many soundtracks of movies, including \'\'[[Remember The Titans]]\'\', \'\'[[Cheaper by the Dozen 2]]\'\', and \'\'[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr & Mrs Smith]]\'\', plus numerous television commercials. "Do Your Thing" was featured on the soundtrack to \'\'[[Boogie Nights (soundtrack)|Boogie Nights]].\'\'  "65 Bars and a Taste of Soul" serves as the theme music for the \'\'[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]\'\' character [[Roan Montgomery]].

\'\'\'Syreeta Wright\'\'\' (August 3, 1946 \xe2\x80\x93 July 6, 2004), who recorded professionally under the single name \'\'\'Syreeta\'\'\', was a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated American singer-songwriter, best known for her work with her ex-husband, [[Stevie Wonder]], and musical artist, [[Billy Preston]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Wright was born Rita Wright in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1946, and started singing at age four. Her father died while serving in the [[Korean War]] and Wright and her two sisters,<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HISHiLVxVnIC&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=yvonne+wright+stevie+wonder&source=bl&ots=nTGaatofrV&sig=sexCkXJICOHDUxXTZ6dub4kljy0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9E6xULr0C8eq0AWdt4HACQ&sqi=2&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=yvonne%20wright%20stevie%20wonder&f=false James E. Perone, \'\'The Sound of Stevie Wonder\'\', p 63]</ref> Yvonne and Kim, were raised by their mother Essie and their grandmother. The Wrights moved back and forth from [[Detroit]] to [[South Carolina]] before finally settling in Detroit just as Wright entered high school. Money problems kept Wright from pursuing a career in [[ballet]] so she focused her attention on a music career joining several singing groups before landing a job as a [[receptionist]] for [[Motown Records|Motown]] in 1965. Within a year, she became a secretary for [[Mickey Stevenson]], just as [[Martha Reeves]] had done before her.

A year later, [[Edward Holland, Jr.|Edward Holland]] of the [[Holland\xe2\x80\x93Dozier\xe2\x80\x93Holland]] songwriting team noticed Wright\'s singing and decided to try her out for demos of [[The Supremes|Supremes]] songs. Motown CEO [[Berry Gordy]] shortened her birth name to "Rita," and Wright released her first solo single, "I Can\'t Give Back the Love I Feel for You", in January,1968.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Wright Rita Wright \xe2\x80\x93 Discover music, concerts, stats, & pictures at]. Last.fm (2012-03-22). Retrieved on 2012-04-26.</ref> The song was initially written for the Supremes (by then billed as "Diana Ross & the Supremes"). They later recorded the song in 1968 and [[Diana Ross]] re-recorded the song for her solo album, \'\'[[Surrender (Diana Ross album)|Surrender]]\'\'. Wright\'s version became a hit for [[Northern soul]] audiences in the [[United Kingdom]], a country where Wright would enjoy success.

Wright also performed demo vocals for the Supremes hit "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]" and Ross\'s "Something\'s On My Mind", which Ross later recorded for her [[Diana Ross (1970 album)|self-titled debut album]]. When [[Diana Ross]] left the Supremes in early 1970, Motown boss [[Berry Gordy]] considered replacing her with Wright, but offered the place in the group to [[Jean Terrell]]. According to several sources, Gordy then changed his mind and tried to replace Terrell with Wright, but this was vetoed by Supreme [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]].<ref>Wilson, Mary (2000). Dreamgirl & Supreme Faith, Updated Edition: My Life as a Supreme. New York: Cooper Square Press. ISBN 0-8154-1000-X</ref>

Wright also sang background on records by the Supremes and by [[Martha and the Vandellas]], notably singing the chorus to the group\'s modest hit single, "[[I Can\'t Dance to That Music You\'re Playing]]". Wright met labelmate [[Stevie Wonder]] in 1968, and the two began dating the following year. On the advice of Wonder, Wright became a songwriter. Their first collaboration, "[[It\'s a Shame (The Spinners song)|It\'s a Shame]]", was recorded by [[The Spinners (U.S. band)|The Spinners]], in 1969. Motown withheld its release until July 1970. The song reached number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\'\'Billboard\'\' Hot 100]]. Wright also began singing background for Wonder, most notably on the hit "[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I\'m Yours)]]", which Wright co-wrote with Wonder. In September 1970, after a year-long courtship, Wright, 24, and Wonder, 20, married in Detroit. The couple then wrote and arranged songs for Wonder\'s \'\'[[Where I\'m Coming From]]\'\', which was released much to Berry Gordy\'s chagrin in the spring of 1971. The Wonder\xe2\x80\x93Wright composition "[[If You Really Love Me]]" (which also featured Wright prominently singing background vocals) reached number 8 in the US that year. In 1971, following Wonder\'s exit from Motown, the couple relocated to [[New York]] where Wonder worked on two independent albums.

===Solo career===
Wonder returned to Motown in 1972 after being promised creative control for his recordings, allowing Wonder to set up a company called Black Bull Productions. Wonder and Wright came with songs for Wonder\'s next album, \'\'[[Music of My Mind]]\'\'. Following a tour opening for [[The Rolling Stones]] in the summer of 1972, Wonder issued his follow-up, \'\'[[Talking Book]]\'\', which turned out to be Wonder\'s breakthrough album. In between the albums, Wright decided to return to her own singing career. Motown reassigned the singer from Motown\'s Gordy imprint, where "I Can\'t Give Back the Love I Feel for You" was released, to Motown\'s L.A.-based MoWest subsidiary. Wonder and Wright had marriage troubles and divorced in the summer of 1972, ending their 18-month marriage. Following their divorce, Wonder oversaw the production of Wright\'s first solo album, \'\'[[Syreeta (1972 album)|Syreeta]]\'\', which included Wright\'s take of Wonder\'s "I Love Every Little Thing About You" from \'\'Music of My Mind\'\', the [[Smokey Robinson]] classic "[[What Love Has Joined Together]]", and [[The Beatles]]\' "[[She\'s Leaving Home]]", which featured both Wonder and Wright applying background vocals via the [[talk box]]. MoWest issued "I Love Every Little Thing About You" in the late winter of 1972, but it failed to chart. Material from \'\'Syreeta\'\' and Wonder\'s \'\'Talking Book\'\' were deemed autobiographical{{by whom|date=February 2011}} due to the rise and fall of the ex-couple\'s marriage. Remaining best friends, Wright would continue to provide background vocals and compositions with Wonder for the next two decades.

In 1974, Wright was again reassigned, this time to the Motown label proper (in the U.S.), and issued her second release, the aptly-titled \'\'[[Stevie Wonder Presents: Syreeta]]\'\' that June. Following the success of [[Minnie Riperton]]\'s \'\'[[Perfect Angel]]\'\', which Wonder also produced, Wonder wanted to present Wright in the same light as Riperton as a sensual vocalist. The covers also were very similar to each other. Riperton added background vocals to the album, promptly at the end of the album track "Heavy Day". The album yielded the UK singles "I\'m Goin\' Left" (covered by [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]]), "Spinnin\' and Spinnin\'" and the [[reggae]]-flavored "Your Kiss is Sweet", which became a UK Top 40, reaching number 12 in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=2509 |title=Syreeta |publisher=Chart Stats |date=1974-09-21 |accessdate=2011-02-11|archiveurl=http://archive.is/ET58W|archivedate=2013-01-18}}</ref> The album also featured one duet with [[G. C. Cameron]], formerly of the Spinners. The duo released the duet album \'\'[[Rich Love, Poor Love]]\'\' in 1977. Production on Wright\'s third album, \'\'[[One to One (Syreeta album)|One to One]]\'\', went on for two years. The album featured the sole Wonder production, "Harmour Love", which found some success after being featured on the movie \'\'[[Junebug (film)|Junebug]]\'\', and was mainly produced by [[Leon Ware]], who also produced [[Marvin Gaye]] and Riperton.

Wright\'s next effort came courtesy of a chance meeting with [[Billy Preston]], who had signed with Motown in early 1979. Motown assigned the two to collaborate on a pop ballad for the movie \'\'[[Fast Break (film)|Fast Break]]\'\'. Wright and Preston provided the soundtrack of the film and their first collaboration, "[[With You I\'m Born Again]]", resulted in an international hit reaching number-four US and number-two UK in late 1979. The success of the song led Motown to renew Wright\'s contract, which was due to expire that year, with neither side looking to renegotiate. Wright and Preston continued their collaborations until 1982. Wright still worked with Wonder during this period singing the lead vocals for their composition "Come Back as a Flower" for Wonder\'s \'\'[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]\'\' and also sung alongside Wonder on his 1980 song "As If You Read My Mind" for his \'\'[[Hotter than July]]\'\' album. Wright continued to provide background vocals until Wonder\'s 1995 album \'\'[[Conversation Peace]]\'\'.

Wright continued to record for Motown into the 1980s, releasing her second [[Syreeta (1980 album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, and releasing the [[funk]]/[[boogie (genre)|boogie]]-oriented \'\'Set My Love in Motion\'\' in late 1981. During that same time period, she added vocals to the theme song for the Canadian slasher-horror flick \'\'[[Happy Birthday to Me (film)|Happy Birthday to Me]]\'\', known for starring \'\'Little House on the Prairie\'\'\xe2\x80\xb2s Melissa Sue Anderson. The album featured the minor R&B hit "Quick Slick", which peaked at number 41 R&B in early 1982. Wright then issued \'\'The Spell\'\' in 1983 and left Motown two years later after collaborating with [[Smokey Robinson]] for the soundtrack to Berry Gordy\'s \'\'[[The Last Dragon]]\'\' in 1985. Wright briefly recorded for [[Motorcity Records]] before retiring from show business for good in the mid-1990s and settling in Los Angeles with her four children.

In 1993, she joined the national touring cast of [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] in the role of Mary Magdalene, alongside original film stars [[Ted Neeley]] and [[Carl Anderson (singer)]].<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-05/entertainment/ca-12182_1_jesus-christ-superstar</ref> She stayed in the cast until 1995.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=EfYugMlfPLcC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=syreeta+jesus+christ+superstar+1995&source=bl&ots=NLn9IS5tby&sig=HvdgdbCybBP2gEwjyvR_p5KTdk4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=58EuVNKjCdbGsQTdjIGQAg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=syreeta%20jesus%20christ%20superstar%201995&f=false</ref>

==Personal life==
Wright was married three times. Her first marriage, to longtime collaborator [[Stevie Wonder]], lasted 18 months between 1970 and 1972, while a marriage to bassist Curtis Robertson Jr<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/syreeta |title=Albums by Syreeta |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> was also short lived. Wright briefly lived in [[Ethiopia]] in the mid-1970s where she worked as a [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] teacher.{{fact|date=February 2015}}  She eventually settled in Los Angeles where she lived for the rest of her life.{{fact|date=February 2015}} Born and raised a [[Baptist]], she converted to [[Islam]] following her third marriage.{{fact|date=February 2015}}

Wright died in 2004 of [[congestive heart failure]], a side effect of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]] treatments she was receiving for breast and [[bone cancer]]. <ref>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Syreeta.html Syreeta Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

\'\'\'Zapp\'\'\' (also known as the \'\'\'Zapp Band\'\'\' or \'\'\'Zapp & Roger\'\'\') is an American [[funk]] band that emerged from [[Hamilton, Ohio]], in 1977.  Particularly influential in the [[Electro (music)|electro]] subgenre of funk, Zapp served as partial inspiration toward the creation of the [[G-funk]] sound of [[hip-hop]] popular on the West Coast of the United States in the early to mid 1990s, with many of their songs sampled by numerous hip-hop artists. The original line-up consisted of four brothers\xe2\x80\x94[[Roger Troutman]], Larry Troutman, Lester Troutman and Terry Troutman\xe2\x80\x94and non-Troutman family members Bobby Glover and Gregory Jackson. The group received attention in the early 1980s for implementing heavy use of the [[talk-box]], which became one of their most well known characteristics. Zapp worked closely with members [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Bootsy Collins]] of the band [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] during its early stages, their support being a factor in the group gaining a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1979. Zapp released its [[Zapp (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1980, having a [[P-funk]] reminiscent sound as a result of Clinton\'s and Collin\'s input on the production. Zapp achieved most of its mainstream recognition from the single "[[More Bounce to the Ounce]]" from the same album, now widely regarded as a classic example of early 1980s electronic funk. The following year in 1981, Clinton stopped producing the band over a record dispute regarding Roger Troutman\'s solo debut. Zapp continued to produce several more albums thereafter, releasing \'\'[[Zapp II]]\'\' in 1982. The album\'s musical style veered drastically away from their first release; despite this, the album sold well, and was certified [[Gold record|gold]] by late 1982.

Zapp disbanded in 1999 after both Roger and Larry Troutman were killed in a [[murder-suicide]], that was apparently carried out by Larry. Roger was shot several times before dying in hospital during surgery. Larry\'s body was found close-by in his vehicle with a single gunshot wound to the head. The motive behind Larry\'s attack is unclear, but there are speculations that were arguments over money, and Larry being angry over the lack of consultation Roger had gave as to why he fired him from being his manager. Zapp reformed briefly in 2003 with the remaining brothers of the Troutman family to produce the album \'\'[[Zapp VI: Back By Popular Demand]]\'\'. Zapp currently tours only around small scale concerts in the [[United States]].

Phelps and Bootsy were attendees at a performance, and were impressed with Zapp\'s musical abilities, prompting Bootsy to invite Roger to the United Sound Studios in Detroit (the P-Funk studio base) which was frequently used by Parliament-Funkadelic.<ref name="p. 334">\'\'Third Ear - Funk\'\' (2001). p. 334</ref> Roger Troutman subsequently wrote and recorded the demo for "[[More Bounce to the Ounce]]" in 1978.<ref name="p. 334" /> [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], the leader of Funkadelic liked the recording and encouraged Troutman to present the demo to [[Warner Bros.

===1980\xe2\x80\x9381: Split with George Clinton and other workings===
After the 1980 release of Zapp\'s debut album, tensions rose between Roger Troutman and George Clinton. Troutman\'s solo album \'\'[[The Many Facets of Roger]]\'\'<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger \xe2\x80\x93 The Many Facets Of Roger|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-many-facets-of-roger-mw0000212101|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> was primarily funded by Clinton, through CBS, and was slated to be released on his own [[Uncle Jam Records]] label.<ref name="p. 334" />  By the early 1980s, Clinton and his musical projects were a midst financial troubles due to his poor management skills and shifting tastes in music.<ref name="pp. 248-249">\'\'Funk - The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One\'\'. (1996). pp. 248-249</ref> Around the time of Troutman\'s to be released debut, Warner Bros. Records dropped Clinton from their label,<ref name="p. 271">\'\'Funk - The Music, the People, and the Rhythm of the One\'\'. (1996). p. 271</ref> and quietly released \'\'[[The Electric Spanking of War Babies]]\'\' which Troutman had worked briefly on,<ref name="p. 334" /> in early 1981 without much impact.<ref name="p. 271" />

Troutman, seeing the disarray that was surrounding Clinton at the time, accepted Warner Bros. offer of more money for the demo recordings of his album. The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman, and with Clinton\'s departure, Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band\'s later work. In Clinton\'s biography \'\'George Clinton: For the Record\'\', Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blas\xc3\xa9 attitude, "... Heck gee-willickers, Warner Bros. offered me mo\' money".<ref name="p. 334" /> In response, Clinton remarked, "CBS paid for it, I paid for it. I don\'t like to go into it on the negative side, but it cost about 5 million [dollars], and a lot of people\'s jobs and what we consider as the empire falling".<ref name="p. 334" />  The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman, is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton\'s and Funkadelic\'s musical careers.<ref name="p. 334" />  \'\'The Many Facets of Roger\'\' was eventually released in October 1981 on Warner Bros.<ref name="Company1981">{{cite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Jet|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA159|date=5 November 1981|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=159|issn=0021-5996}}</ref>

===1982\xe2\x80\x9385: Style change and gradual decline===
Zapp released its second album, \'\'[[Zapp II]]\'\', on October 14, 1982. It focused on more of an electronic orientated sound, containing greater use of the talk-box that is often considered Troutman\'s trademark. Despite the contrasting styles between the first and the second albums, \'\'Zapp II\'\' attained gold status by September 21, 1982.<ref name=RIAA>certification</ref> The album fared almost as well as Zapp\'s debut, peaking at number two on the Billboard R&B chart, and reaching 25 on The Billboard 200 Albums chart. The single "Dancefloor (Part I)" peaked at number one on the R&B singles chart of 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp II Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-ii-mw0000199209/awards|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130618132238/http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-ii-mw0000199209/awards|archivedate=July 18, 2013|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

Zapp spawned several more albums in close succession within the 1980s, retaining the heavily electronic style that \'\'Zapp II\'\' had adopted. \'\'[[Zapp III]]\'\' was released in 1983, but it did not reach the same chart positions as Zapp\'s previous efforts. While still gaining a gold certification,<ref name="RIAA">certification</ref> it only peaked at 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R&B chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp III Credits|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-iii-mw0000738540/awards|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130520051411/http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapp-iii-mw0000738540/awards|archivedate=May 20, 2013|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> \'\'<nowiki>Zapp III\'</nowiki>\'\'s poorer commercial performance became a sign that the band\'s popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s, with post-disco music falling out of trend.

===1993\xe2\x80\x9396: Resurgence and brief increase in popularity===
The growing and increasingly dominant West Coast hip-hop scene of the early to mid 1990s brought Zapp and Roger back into the spotlight for a brief amount of time as many hip-hop acts began favoring Zapp\'s material as a source for sampling in their own music. Troutman gained recognition for providing talk-box backing vocals for both the original and remixed version of [[Tupac Shakur]]\'s 1995-96 comeback single "[[California Love]]"; the alternate version of the music video features Troutman playing the keyboard and talk-box during a party. Roger\'s involvement in "California Love" awarded him a Grammy nomination for "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group" in 1997.<ref name="p. 334" /><ref>{{cite web|title=39th Grammy Awards - 1997 (held February 26, 1997)

===1996\xe2\x80\x93present: Deaths of Roger and Larry Troutman, disbandment, and current activity===
On Sunday morning, April 25, 1999, Roger Troutman was fatally wounded as a result of an apparent murder-suicide that was orchestrated by his older brother, Larry. Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton, Ohio. Roger was taken to [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Dayton)|Good Samaritan Hospital]], but died shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp\'s Roger And Larry Troutman Killed In Apparent Murder-Suicide|date=April 26, 1999|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433975/zapps-roger-larry-troutman-killed-apparent-murder-suicide.jhtml|publisher=MTV|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> Larry\'s body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene. There were no witnesses at the time, and Larry\'s motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear, however, there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family run housing company, Troutman Enterprises. The business filed for [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]], owing $400,000 in delinquent taxes.<ref name="p. 334" /> Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career, of which Larry had been for several years.

After Troutman\'s death, [[Ice Cube]] said that "More Bounce To The Ounce" introduced him to hip-hop. "I was in the sixth grade, we\'d stayed after school. We had this dude named Mr. Lock, and he used to bring in his radio with these pop-lockers. He used to teach [the dance group] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song \'More Bounce\', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn\'t know nothing about nothing. I hadn\'t heard "[[Rapper\'s Delight]]" yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since \'More Bounce\' goes on forever, they just got down. I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me, like a chemical reaction in my brain."<ref>{{cite web|title=California Loved|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2002-08-14/news/california-loved/|work=Sfweekly|last1=Williams|first1=P-Frank|date=August 14, 2002|at= para.2-3|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> During Roger\'s funeral, his nephew Clet Troutman performed a talk-box rendition of "[[Amazing Grace]]". Roger is survived by his five sons and daughters, his sixth son Roger Lynch Troutman Jr. died of head injuries several years after the murder of Roger, (January 31, 1970 \xe2\x80\x93 January 22, 2003).<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Roger Troutman, Jr. in Minneapolis|last=Scholtes|first=Peter|date=May 6, 2003|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/pscholtes/2003/05/remembering_roger_troutman_jr.php |at=para.4|work=Citypages|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

The resulting impact of Roger and Larry\'s deaths left the band stranded, halting production. Without Roger serving as the creative source, they effectively disbanded, and quietly left the music industry altogether. Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label, bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close. A few years later, Zapp resurfaced for a short period after the establishment of its own independent label, Zapp Town Records,<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp Town Records|url=http://www.discogs.com/label/149097-Zapp-Town|publisher=discogs|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref> managed by the Troutman family. The label released its only album, \'\'[[Zapp VI: Back By Popular Demand]]\'\', in 2003. Zapp returned to performing only in live concert, touring across the U.S. at various small scale venues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zapp tour schedule|url=http://www.thezappband.com/#!schedule-and-results/c1x9v|work=Zapp official website|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>
