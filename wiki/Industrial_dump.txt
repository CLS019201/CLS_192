They released their first EP ''10 Ton Pressure'', parted ways with Frank and moved to [[New York City]], their base for the duration of their career. The band toured with acts such as [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[KMFDM]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[16volt]], and [[GWAR]].\n\nAfter releasing the albums ''Burn Out At The Hydrogen Bar'' and ''East Side Militia'' on [[Fifth Colvmn Records]], Chemlab broke up in 1997 and then reformed in 2004 to release an album entitled ''Oxidizer'' with Jared as the only original member. After a seven-year hiatus from the stage, Jared recreated Chemlab and, with a backing band composed of the members of electro-industrial group mindFIELD performed a one-off show in Boston, Massachusetts in August 2005. The band played another one-off show, this time in New York City on January 7, 2006. A third show in San Francisco on March 17, 2006, saw the band joined by fellow coldwave bands [[Babyland]] and Deathline International.

Singer-programmer Daniel Neet has been the only constant member throughout the band's history, leading the group as its sound has evolved to incorporate gothic, industrial and metal influences. Neet is also a member of the band Iron Lung Corp.\n\nOriginally known as \"Clay People,\" the group added \"The\" to their name with the release of a self-titled 1998 album, marking a change in direction toward a less-synthetic/sampled approach to live performance with a lineup featuring Neet, Brian McGarvey (guitar), Mike Guzzardi (guitar), D. Patrick Walsh (bass) and Dan Dinsmore (drums). ''The Clay People'' (1998 album) was produced by Neil Kernon for Slipdisc Records (a Mercury affiliate); Kernon also worked with [[Queensr\u00ffche]] and [[David Bowie]], among many others. It was the band's most commercially successful release, and songs from the record were included in the soundtracks to films ''[[Strangeland (film)|Strangeland]]'' and ''[[Universal Soldier: The Return]],'' as well as on the soundtracks to several video games. \n\nThe band went on hiatus in the early 2000s as members pursued solo and side projects or launched new bands, including Idols Never Die<ref>[http://www.idolsneverdie.com/]</ref> and Black Incorporated featuring both Guzzardi and Dinsmore. A new album from The Clay People, ''Waking the Dead'', was released on May 22, 2007 via Overit Records with a lineup featuring only Neet, Dinsmore and McGarvey from the 1998 band.\n\nAlongside the new release was a music video for the album's first single, \"Supersonic Overdrive,\" directed by Jay Bender of Phobic Films.\n\nIn June of 2012, The Clay People reformed to perform the Jamie Duffy memorial show \"Cold Waves\". This show would include a line-up never seen before of the who's who of the industrial scene including long time friends [[Acumen Nation]], [[16 Volt]], [[Chemlab]], [[Hate Dept.]], Go Fight, [[I:Scintilla]], [[Cyanotic (band)|Cyanotic]], and members of the [[Revolting Cocks]].

The name was taken from [[Cyber-Tec Records]], who released their [[Let Your Body Die (Cyber-Tec album)|first album]].  This EP was also released on [[Fifth Column Records]] in the US.  After this release, Jonathan Sharp left the band (due to problems with Cyber-Tec Records manager Paul M. Green), and [[Marc Heal]] (of [[Cubanate]]) joined as a full-time member.  \n\nThe band had been conceived as a one-off project, but the members at this point decided to pursue further material.  In 1997, after shortening their name to C-Tec, they released a full album, ''[[Darker (album)|Darker]]'', on the US industrial [[Wax Trax!]] label. \n\nC-Tec existed during the late 1990s hiatus in the Front 242 line-up, with De Meyer (the original lead singer in 242) apparently leaving that band for a period. The band toured North America twice in 1998 with a hybrid lineup featuring other members of Cubanate and [[Julian Beeston]], one time drummer in [[Nitzer Ebb]]. The second album, ''[[Cut (C-Tec album)|Cut]]'', was released in 2000 on [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] imprint [[Synthetic Symphony]].  The album was originally slated for US release on Wax Trax! but the label closed around this time.  Thereby, ''Cut'' never had an official American release.\n\nIn terms of how C-Tec sounded, ''Darker'' contains a surprisingly downbeat, moody collection of songs, showing strong electronic influences but with more ambient textures than would be suggested by the [[industrial music]] backgrounds of the main participants. ''Cut'' is faster in tempo, with De Meyer\u2019s vocal mixed low. Most of the material on the two full-length C-Tec albums was co-written by Marc Heal and Jean-Luc De Meyer. \n\nSince ''Cut'', C-Tec appears to have been inactive, though lead singer Jean-Luc De Meyer later resurfaced with a new Front 242 album in 2003."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"1090012":{"pageid":1090012,"ns":0,"title":"Das Ich","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Das Ich\n| image                 = Dasich.jpg\n| caption            =  \n| image_size            = <!-- Only for images narrower than 220 pixels -->\n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = \n| origin              = [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]\n| genre               = [[Electronic music]]<br />[[Neue Deutsche Todeskunst]]<br />[[Dark Wave]]<br />[[Industrial music]]<br />[[Electro-industrial]]\n| years_active        = 1989\u2013present\n| label               = [[Danse Macabre (record label)|Danse Macabre]]<br>[[Metropolis Records|Metropolis]]<br>[[Massacre Records|Massacre]]\n| associated_acts     = Seelenzorn\n| website                 = \n| current_members     = [[Bruno Kramm]] <br/> [[Stefan Ackermann]]\n| past_members        = \n}}\n\n'''Das Ich''' is a [[Germany|German]] electronic music group formed in 1989.

The group's original line-up consisted of [[Dave Gahan]] (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005), [[Martin Gore]] (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]] (keyboards), and [[Vince Clarke]] (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980\u201381). Depeche Mode released their debut record in 1981, ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]'', bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. Clarke left the band after the release of the album, leaving the band as a trio to record ''[[A Broken Frame]]'', released the following year. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, [[Alan Wilder]] (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, establishing a line up that would continue for the next thirteen years.\n\nThe band's last albums of the 1980s, ''[[Black Celebration]]'' and ''[[Music for the Masses]]'', established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In the new decade, Depeche Mode released ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', catapulting them to massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'', and the supporting [[Devotional Tour]] exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split. Now a trio once again, the band released ''[[Ultra (Depeche Mode album)|Ultra]]'' in 1997, recorded at the height of Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Gore's alcoholism and Fletcher's depression. The release of ''[[Exciter (album)|Exciter]]'' confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful, [[Exciter Tour]] being their first tour in support of an original album in eight years since the [[Devotional Tour]], although the band had [[The Singles Tour|toured in 1998]] to support ''[[The Singles 86\u201398|The Singles 86>98]]'' compilation album.\n\nDepeche Mode have had fifty songs in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have sold over 100 million records worldwide,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |title= Depeche Mode mit Weltpremiere beim ECHO |publisher= [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |date= 3 February 2009 |accessdate= 18 August 2014 |language= de}}</ref> making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands in music history]].<ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite journal|first= Kerri |last= Mason |title= Depeche Mode Prepares For Tour Of The Universe |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269153/depeche-mode-prepares-for-tour-of-the-universe |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher= [[Prometheus Global Media]] |date= 23 March 2009 |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine calls Depeche Mode \"the most popular electronic band the world has ever known\"<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|url= http://bestof.depechemode.com/ |title= Depeche Mode \u2013 The Best Of, Volume 1 |work= [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |publisher= DepecheMode.com |accessdate= 25 May 2011}}</ref> and included the band in the list of the \"50 Bands That Changed the World!\".<ref name=\"50Bands\">{{cite journal|title= Q \u2013 50 Bands That Changed The World! |magazine= Q |date= May 2004 |issue= 214 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World |publisher= Rocklist.net |accessdate= 31 March 2012}}</ref>"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"1081416":{"pageid":1081416,"ns":0,"title":"Der Blutharsch","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Der Blutharsch\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = \n| background          = group_or_band\n| alias               = \n| origin              = [[Austria]]\n| genre               = [[Martial industrial]]<br>[[Neofolk]]<br>[[Ambient industrial]]\n| years_active        = 1996\u2013present\n| label               = [[Wir Kapitulieren Niemals|WKN]]\n| associated_acts     = \n| website                 = [http://www.derblutharsch.com http://www.derblutharsch.com]\n| current_members     = [[Albin Julius]]<br>[[Marthynna]]<br>[[Bain Wolfkind]]<br>[[J\u00f6rg B.]]\n| past_members        = \n| notable_instruments = \n}}\n\n'''Der Blutharsch''' is the primary musical project of [[Austria]]n musician [[Albin Julius]]."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"1607536":{"pageid":1607536,"ns":0,"title":"D'espairsRay","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = D'espairsRay\n| image           = D'espairsRay Jrock revolution.jpg \n| caption         = D'espairsRay in Los Angeles, 2007\n| image_size      = \n| landscape       = yes\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = Animalmania\n| origin          = [[Japan]]\n| genre           = [[Alternative metal]], [[industrial metal]]\n| years_active    = 1999\u20132011, 2014\n| label           = Speed Disk, Maniac, [[Delicious Deli Records|Delicious Deli]], [[Sword Records, Inc.|Sword]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]], [[Gan-Shin]] <small>(EU)</small>, [[Spinefarm Records|Spinefarm]] <small>(EU)</small>, JShock <small>(US)</small>, Maru Music <small>(US)</small>\n| website         = [http://www.despairsray.jp/ despairsray.jp]\n| associated_acts = The Micro Head 4N's, [[Angelo (band)|Angelo]]\n| current_members = \n| past_members    = Hizumi<br />[[Karyu]]<br />Zero<br />Tsukasa\n}}\n\n'''D'espairsRay''' (formerly stylized as '''D\u00e9spairsRay''' or '''+D\u00e9spairsRay+''') was a Japanese [[visual kei]] [[Rock music|rock]] band active from 1999 to 2011.

Their debut album, ''[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]'', was released in 1995, and ended up going platinum, selling over one million copies, largely due to the success of the band's single \"[[Hey Man Nice Shot]].\" After the album, the band would go through the first of many line-up changes, leaving Patrick as the only consistent member across all music releases.\n\nPatrick released the band's follow up album, ''[[Title of Record]]'', which also went platinum, off the success of the song \"[[Take a Picture]]\", in 1999, and a third album, ''[[The Amalgamut]]'', in 2002, before checking into rehab after years of heavy [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]]. The band went into hiatus while Patrick went to rehab, and then formed a new band, [[Army of Anyone]], which released [[Army of Anyone (album)|one self-title album]]. Filter reformed in 2008 to release ''[[Anthems for the Damned]]'', and then ''[[The Trouble with Angels (album)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' in 2010, with Patrick and a revolving door of other musicians.

After 1995 the name permanently became '''Foetus''', though the related project '''The Foetus Symphony Orchestra''' was founded in 1997 and continues.\n\nThirlwell acts as the sole instrumentalist, vocalist, songwriter and producer for all Foetus works and as such is the only member of the band.

One such grouping is [[Wiseblood (band)|Wiseblood]] with former [[Swans (band)|Swans]] member [[Roli Mosimann]]. The material tends toward the realm of the darkest and most sexual Foetus songs, with Mosimann's Swans lineage showing in the slow, crushing pacing of many tracks. Thematically, Wiseblood's lyrics center around the misanthropic exertion of power, typically via murder, sex or assault.

They had their first hit single with \"[[Guilty (Gravity Kills song)|Guilty]]\", a track later released on their self-titled album ''[[Gravity Kills (album)|Gravity Kills]]''. Gravity Kills' songs were featured on the soundtracks for ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Seven (film)|Se7en]]'', ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'', and ''[[Kissing a Fool]]'', as well as video games like [[Test Drive Off-Road]]. They have toured with such bands as [[Sevendust]] and [[Pigface]].\n\nThe band released two additional albums of new material, ''[[Perversion (album)|Perversion]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Superstarved]]'' in 2002, as well as a remix album in 1997. Their singles \"[[Falling (Gravity Kills song)|Falling]]\", from ''[[Perversion (album)|Perversion]]'' and \"[[Superstarved#One Thing|One Thing]]\", from ''[[Superstarved]]'', achieved minor success.\n\nIn August 1999, drummer Kurt Kerns left the band to pursue a career in architecture. Gravity Kills departed [[TVT Records]] and signed to [[Sanctuary Records]] & drummer Brad Brooker joined the band to perform & release the third album ''[[Superstarved]]''. Following a severe injury to keyboardist Doug Firley's hands, and lack of tour support from their record label, they were unable to complete a tour for ''Superstarved'' and broke up in 2003.\n\nSince 2006, Gravity Kills has reunited for occasional one-off festivals and shows, and is now working on new material."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"4215371":{"pageid":4215371,"ns":0,"title":"Greater Than One","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Infobox musical artist\n|name            = Greater Than One\n|image           = Greater Than One.jpg\n|image_size      = \n|caption         = Greater Than One (Newman and Wells mid)\n|alias           = Tricky Disco, GTO, John + Julie, Church of Extacy, Signs of Chaos, T.D.5, Salami Brothers, Killout Squad, Technohead L.E.D.. \n|background      = group_or_band\n|origin          = [[London]], [[England]]\n|genre           = [[Industrial music|Industrial]] (early period) <br> [[House music|House]] <br> [[Techno]]  <br> [[Psychedelic music|Psychedelic]] <br> [[Hardcore techno]]<br>[[Trance music|Trance]]\n|years_active    = 1985\u20131995\u20131996-2000\n|label           = Kunst = Kapital (1987) <br> [[Wax Trax!

The group releases albums and performs music in the same vein as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Skinny Puppy]] and [[The Prodigy]]. Seibold is a multi-instrumentalist who manages to write, record and release Hate Dept. albums without the aid of outside help. He formed Hate Dept. in 1991 in reaction to fickle 'electro' audiences and antipathy towards live electronic bands, taking his sound in a more punk direction.<ref name=wlfmint/>\n\nHate Dept.'s debut album in 1994, ''Meat.Your.Maker'', appeared in [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'s Top 10 alternative albums while Seibold was nominated 'Best New Talent' by Keyboard Magazine. ''Omnipresent'', the second release by the group, again entered charts in Rolling Stone and [[Alternative Press]]. Hate Dept. had a brief period of commercial success after the release of the third album ''Technical Difficulties''. The only single, ''Release It'', earned radio airplay in 50 North American markets.\n\nSeibold joined [[Pigface]] in 2001, touring and recording with [[Martin Atkins]] in several projects. During this time, Hate Dept. released their fourth album ''Ditch'' in 2003. Although the band had publicly announced the release of the fifth studio album, ''A New Ghost.'' Production stalled and for years, fans were left with little more than rumors of random, unavailable songs.\n\nIn August 2013, 10 years after the release of ''Ditch'', Seibold announced via Facebook that a fifth studio album, now titled simply, ''New Ghost,'' was set for an August 27, independent release. Shortly after the announcement, this statement was posted:\n\n''\"I'm not ignoring the questions I've been asked about the access and sale of the new album, 'New Ghost', I'm just thinking about the answer. If it is to be considered a luxury to be an 'independent artist', one must treat it as such. We won't disappoint you. You'll hear it August 27th, see it, touch it, feel it and study it, shortly after if you chose to. And, if geography permits, we will perform close enough to you to once again make ears ring, shake hands and embrace...\"''\n\nNew Ghost was released Aug 2013 to much fan praise.  He also allowed many fans who he met on facebook to sing on a chorus vocal in the song Broken Rule, one fan included the singer of the band Gravity Kills.  Currently it's available at http://hatedept.bandcamp.com/album/new-ghost-2\n\nIn 2014 Seibold began posting videos of himself performing acoustic versions of many Hate Dept. songs discussing with his fans the possibility of acoustic shows in the future.\n\nn 2014 Seibold released a trilogy of remix albums for New Ghost on http://hatedept.bandcamp.com/  When releasing those Hate Dept. became one of the first bands to allow some of there creative fans to remix there songs for actual release.

Its earliest incarnation included German drummer [[En Esch]] and British vocalist [[Raymond Watts]], the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. German guitarist [[G\u00fcnter Schulz]] joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin), and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer [[Lucia Cifarelli]], British guitarists [[Jules Hodgson]] and [[Steve White (guitarist)|Steve White]], and British drummer [[Andy Selway]].\n\nCritics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band's music as \"The Ultra-Heavy Beat\". The band incorporates [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] guitar riffs, [[electronic music]], samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles.

These Belgian musicians have often been considered the pioneers of [[electronic body music]] (EBM), together with another Belgian band, [[Front 242]]. EBM is a high-tech genre from the early '80s, combining [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[electro (music)|electro]] music, from which later originated [[new beat]] and [[techno]].\n\nDavo Da Davo and TB Frank veered between minimalistic industrial drones and odd, new wave synthpop and dance music, underlain by cold, mechanical rhythms. Their initial music is aggressive, danceable and dominated by synthesizers and drum-machines. A bit later on in their career, the guitar also had a prominent place in their music.\n\nThe Neon Judgement recorded most of their output for the Play It Again Sam label in Belgium, beginning with 1986's ''Mafu Cage''. Their first American release did not come until 1987, with the sex-themed concept album, ''Horny As Hell''. Subsequent recordings included ''Blood and Thunder'' (1989), ''The Insult'' (1990), and ''Are You Real'' (1992).\n\nThe duo took a three-year hiatus to rethink the direction of their music, after which they returned in 1995 with ''At Devil's Fork'', an LP recorded with percussionist Ben Forceville entirely in a wooded area.\n\nThe band briefly stopped performing in 1998, but reformed in 2004 and started performing live again to promote a series of remixes and re-releases of their material. The touring continued into 2006, with the band promising on their [http://www.theneonjudgement.com/ website] that, \"Live, The Neon Judgement will continue to give art terrorism a good name, finding new ways of marrying noise and beauty, machines and magic\".\n\nDirk Da Davo is also in the side project Neon Electronics, for which he started his own record label Dancedelic-D and he both reworks old classics and composes new material.\n\nIn November 2005, the Neon Judgement did a show at the Machina Festival at the Broadway Club in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The festival celebrated the first eight years of the site FiberOnline and the launch of the label Fiber Records. Fiber Records released the DVD ''The Neon Judgement \u2013 Live at Machina Festival'' in 2005 featuring the whole concert of 13 songs.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26694_0_2_1_C The Neon Judgement live at Machina Festival DVD out now]</ref> \n\nIn 2007, the band released the compilation album ''Redbox''.<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25107_0_2_1_C The Neon Judgement announces ''Redbox'']</ref> The release comes after the success of the 100% vintage 2&nbsp;CD ''Box'' released in October 2005. ''Redbox'' mainly contains the band's work during the second half of the 1980s. The album also features [[remix]]es from acts such as David Carretta, Blackstrobe, Lifelike, and Helmut Kraft.

Over the course of a dozen studio [[album]]s and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included [[Dwayne Goettel]] (1986\u20131995), [[Dave Ogilvie|Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie]] (long-time associate, producer, and \"unofficial\" fourth member until 1995), [[Mark Walk]] (2003\u2013present), and a number of guests, including [[Bill Leeb]] (1985\u20131986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), [[Al Jourgensen]] (1989), and many others.\n\nAfter the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label [[Nettwerk]], anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP ''[[Remission (Skinny Puppy album)|Remission]]'' in 1984 to their 1992 album ''[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]'', Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated [[cult]] following,<ref name=\"Chartattack 2001-07-20\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/29387/doomsday-comes-for-skinny-puppy-fans |title=Doomsday Comes For Skinny Puppy Fans |accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=[[Chartattack]]|date=2001-07-20|author=Chartattack.com staff}}</ref> fusing elements of [[ambient music|ambient]], [[noise music|noise]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[electro music|electro]], and [[rock music]] and making [[innovative]] use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as [[chemical warfare]] and [[animal testing]].\n\nIn 1993, Skinny Puppy left [[Nettwerk]] and long-time producer [[Dave Ogilvie|Rave]], signing with [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] and relocating to [[Malibu, California]], where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]''. Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a [[heroin]] overdose two months later. The album was completed with [[Dave Rave|Rave]] and released in Goettel's memory in 1996. Key and Ogre, already active in [[List of Skinny Puppy side projects|a number of other projects]], went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the [[Doomsday Festival]] in [[Dresden]], Germany, in 2000.

Ane and STR recorded their first album, ''Grim-Stroke-Disease'' together, releasing it on the Machinery/Noise [[Record label|label]] in [[1990 in music|1990]]. About a year later, it was followed by ''Grow-Speed Injection''. \n\nShortly after the [[1994 in music|1994]] album ''Combat Shock'', Swamp Terrorists added several members for their live show: bassist Anrej A, guitarist Spring and drummer Piet Hertig. However, STR left the band immediately following the [[1995 in music|1995]] release ''Killer'', and began to work with the guitar-heavy Hellsau. The other four members of the band, as well as STR's live replacement ND, have since released a live album, ''Five in Japan'' and 2 EPs: ''Wreck'' in [[1997 in music|1997]], and ''Rare & Unreleased'' in [[1999 in music|1999]], on [[Metropolis Records]]."}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"671515":{"pageid":671515,"ns":0,"title":"The Swans","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"#REDIRECT [[Swans_(band)]]"}]}}}}{"query":{"pages":{"5430376":{"pageid":5430376,"ns":0,"title":"Test Dept","revisions":[{"contentformat":"text/x-wiki","contentmodel":"wikitext","*":"{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\n'''Test Dept.''' were an [[industrial music]] group from [[London]], one of the most important and influential early industrial music acts.

Tweaker's musical style incorporates [[synthpop]], [[progressive rock]], modern [[jazz]] and [[electronica]] genres, and is characterized by a generally melancholy and sombre sound with distinctive artwork to match.\n\nThe album ''[[The Attraction to All Things Uncertain]]'' was Vrenna's \"solo\" debut and it was not until the follow-up album, ''[[2 a.m. Wakeup Call]]'', that Clint Walsh was announced as a permanent fixture to the band.
