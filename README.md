OVERVIEW

The purpuse of this project is to map the formation of bands across several genres of music. In doing so, I hope to uncover some patterns that link genres and movements within music together The end result will be a series of maps, organized by year, mapping when new bands were formed from each genre.

TOOLS USED

I will be using Python to extract information from each bands wikipedia page. The Wikipedia Python Library will be used extensively. For graphing, I will use R, and most likely the rworldmap package.

STATUS UPDATES

4-6-2015: work has begun on collecting band names for each genre, starting with industial. By the end of this week I hope to have every band, and maybe some locations. I also need to find a library mapping town names to coordinates
